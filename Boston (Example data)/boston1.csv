0,"I was fortunate enough to be invited to the ""soft opening"" of this restaurant last night.  It is located in the former home of cafe graffiti on Hanover St.  This restaurant features some really large windows that completely open up to give the ""outdoor seating experience"" to the entire restaurant.  They are set to open officially this Friday night.  The food was exceptional.  They brought us numerous dishes from the menu including mushrooms in truffle foam (to die for), filet, fried calamari, swordfish and many more.  The dishes were full of flavor and really got your mouth happy.  I wish I could give them an extra star for the amount of wine they poured in my glass.  I left there very very happy.  I will definitely be back once they officially open up.One side note they don't serve coffee or dessert.  The owner feels that is part of the entire North End experience.  He thinks after a good meal you should walk around, stop in the shops and end your visit with a stop at your favortie pastry shop.",5,8/14/2008,Carmelina's
1,"It's a nice, modern Italian restaurant, a good place for a date, somewhat loud with very tasty food and excellent service. We especially enjoyed the scallops and the accommodating attitude of the wait staff.",4,8/31/2008,Carmelina's
2,"I was visiting Boston on business from San Francisco and had never been to Hanover Street before.  I had a great meal at Ristorante Damiano.  I just wish I wasn't alone and could have ordered more!  The outstanding dishes I had were the Seared Scallops with Grapefruit Chile Glaze, Lamb Lollipops, and Pasta Carbonara.It was great to find this restaurant with a more modern edge - there were tons of other restaurants with very similar menus.  The service was also great.  I was sitting in the back of the restaurant and was able to watch the staff who seemed to work together very well.  They checked every glass they picked-up to make sure it was spotless!Please give this place a try if you haven't been there yet.  I just wished I could have ordered a cocktail here.",5,9/27/2008,Carmelina's
3,"I'm finding it hard to believe no one else gave a ""tapas"" take on Italian food sooner. I'm of the type that usually goes out and ends up sitting at the bar so I don't feel bad just ordering a couple appetizers as my meal. Of course, then you're limited to appetizer-like food. Damiano has entree-type offerings, indivudally prepared as small portions. Food was excellent, but there are a few unique characteristics of this place I enjoyed very much and warrant a higher rating:-No reservations (No, thats not a negative...when Friday night comes and you want dinner but didn't have the forethought to book a reservation and dont want to wait 1-2 hours there is now a better option!) -All wines available by the glass. -Lots of specials to choose from, so you don't get bored on your second and third visits.",5,10/9/2008,Carmelina's
4,This place has an amazing wine by the glass selection - it's the only place I've found that you can find a barolo by the glass!Beyond the wine - everything I've had there has been great.  They recently had a goat cheese topped fillet. Yum!  AND I have the mushroom risotto on a weekly basis!   Try it out!,5,11/5/2008,Carmelina's
5,"The food was wonderful - excellent quality and taste and nice presentation. My only criticism is that I felt rushed by the waiter. A couple of times he tried to take our plates away when we weren't finished. Also, when we arrived at about 7 (on a weeknight) he tried to seat us at a little table squeezed in on the far wall. Since there were only 2 other tables with people at them, I asked to be moved to one of the larger tables at at the window - the waiter was accomodating.",4,11/14/2008,Carmelina's
6,"Seems like Francesca wants to hunt me down and personally put the smack down on me! Good thing yelp is fairly anonymous. To reiterate my original message: I liked the risotto, I thought everything else we got was not that great. BUT I went early on in their time open, perhaps things are different now, as so many people have enjoyed it. I am so glad that everyone has had a good time! That's what I love-- people enjoying their dining out.",3,12/3/2008,Carmelina's
7,"This place was delish.Small, intimate, with a great (awesome, fantastic, cannot stress enough how lovely) staff. I went with three of my friends at random - we were just roaming around the North End looking for somewhere to eat.  We chose Damianos because there wasn't much of a line, but there were plenty of people inside, and their menu was intriguing. We were seated promptly, waited on attentively by an adorable waitress and a very charming waiter. We immediately had bread and water, and our drink orders taken. Damianos offers a selection of piattini (I think that's what they're called), and they're essentially Italian tapas - and they were effing amazing, seriously. Between the four of us, we tried eight different dishes, each of which was more delectable than the last. Skillfully prepared, attractively presented, with awesome fresh ingredients (and if you want my advice and you're into mushrooms, get the wild mushroom risotto and the mushroom dish (there are like five kinds of mushrooms in it) with truffle oil. Oh jesus. Oh mary). I think this'd be a great place to take a date, except sadly, you'll only get to try four dishes instead of eight, which is sad for you both! Nonetheless, the atmosphere, good wine, great service, and incredible food should console you well enough.  Yay!",4,12/7/2008,Carmelina's
8,"Sorry but some one needs to be negative and I guess it's going to be me. Now I am not going to say the food is awful, because it's not. It's just that you can get the same quality food almost anywhere else in the North End area and even better food at some places (if your willing to pay for it) the thing with Damianos is that the portions to price ratio is awful, for the same price I can get the same quality food and a lot more.... But like I said the food is good",2,12/13/2008,Carmelina's
9,"Damiano's puts a spin on the traditional North End eatery. While there are similarities to other establishments (romantic atmosphere, great wine, small dining room) the menu is much different. Unlike any other North End restaurant, tapas are served here. While portions are always a top priority of mine, 4 ""piatini's"" satisfied my dining parter and I. Music and atmosphere often set a tone for the meal. I was impressed with their trendy tunes. They did not distract dicussions, but were a pleasant cacophony in the background...I highly suggest Damianos and will dine there again. I purchased a gift card for my sister and brother in law because I think they will love it!",4,12/22/2008,Carmelina's
10,"It's cozy and sweet inside; I had a wonderful experience here, but I could see how it could go awry.  We had great food, great service, and great wine.  I was surprised to see how reasonably priced it was!!! Overall, this is a great place to eat and to enjoy a long meal. I would recommend that you try to take the upper hand in the situation starting from when you first walk in.  I definitely see how other people have been walked on.",5,12/25/2008,Carmelina's
11,I have eaten here a bunch of times with some friends and we have always been very happy.  We order a whole variety of things and never get that stuffed feeling after eating Italian Food. One of the best in the North End.,5,1/7/2009,Carmelina's
12,"After posting a similar review on boston.com's Dining Chat, I received the below message from the chef and owner of Ristorante Damiano.  In his defense, I posted it.  My reply is below as well.Hi Kim, I am the owner/chef of Damiano that allegedly yelled and screamed at you and your date and everyone else that night. I was going to let it go until I saw that you continue to slam me to Devra First on Dining Chat. Do you have a personal issue with me? I was cordial and nice to both of you. My daughter and staff were completely shocked at your yelp review. They could not believe your allegations. We were happy to accomodate you that late in the evening and we didn't rush you at all, like many other places would have. There was no yelling at anyone. I find it hard to believe that you would speak untruths, but then again, I don't know you. You were both thinking about the edamame and that's why I sent it complimentary. And believe it or not, even in ""piattini"" style, the food should be brought to you in a certain order, with the sea bass being the last dish. BTW you did not cut into the seabass, it was intact. As far as texting goes, it was late at night and Prezza needed to borrow some food form us because they were short. I never yell at my daughter, She is the most precious and important person in my life. I can let your review go right by me and not bother me. Please do not slander me or my daughter and please stop this nonsense. Let it go. You don't like my restaurant, that's fine. But please do stop the lies. I have a full staff and a daughter that were all here that night. I joked and thought i was being not only pleasant but making sure I served you the best food and that you received it in the proper way, as I always do. Nonetheless, you were a paying customer and I would be happy to make it up to you if you ever decide to come back. You can reach me via this system.Thank you, DamienDamien,I'm someone who dines out frequently.  I sometimes Yelp about it, but I almost always chat on boston.com.  I give positive reviews and I give negative reviews, depending on my experience.  I have eaten at some of the finest restaurants in the world, and some of the worst.  I hold no personal grudges, and I approach each with an open mind.  As you can read in my Yelp review, I said I enjoyed the food at your restaurant.  Actually, I said our last two course were ""undeniably delicious"".  While I was somewhat disheartened by the risotto, I cannot deny that it had amazing flavor.  I also said you had a great and reasonably priced wine list, and that the service was friendly.I never said that your staff rushed us, and I wouldn't expect any restaurant to do so, whether we got there a half house before the kitchen closed or a few minutes before it did so.Perhaps our definitions of yelling are different (I come from a soft-spoken English family), but I fondly remember you calling over loudly to your servers demanding to know who brought us the dish.  I also did not say that you yelled AT your daughter; I said you yelled TO her.  I'm sorry if you took offense to my wording, although I did find it inappropriate that you would give her food that had sat in front of us.  As someone with past restaurant experience, I would have been fired on the spot for doing that in front of a diner.As far as the sequence of courses, it has also been my understanding that small plates are presented as they are cooked.  I did some quick research and found that others are under the same impression.  The following quote from food writer Kathryn Matthews was featured on Portfolio.com, the website of worldwide magazine publishing company, Conde Nast (responsible for food magazines such as Bon Appetite and Gourmet):""Another valuable benefit is that small plates are served on an ""as ready"" basis (rather than sequentially like a traditional meal)"" (portfolio.com/culture-li…).I believe that you love your daughter and was in no way intending on slandering either of you.  I merely gave my review based on the experience I had that night.  I don't believe that I insulted her in any way.  I gave an honest review, as I always do.  However, in your defense, I will post your message to me under my review so that other readers hear both sides of the story.Once again, I sincerely apologize if you took offense as that was not my intention.Regards,Kim",2,1/30/2009,Carmelina's
13,"Interesting concept. Smaller plates (piattini) of food . A nice option when you don't want a gut busting North End meal. The food was very good. I tried the duck breast and seared sea scallops. The duck breast was ok, a little on the bland side and not as rare as I wanted. The seared sea scallops with grapefruit, chili pepper glaze and oyster mushrooms was excellent. Others in our dinner  party tried scallops with pasta and lemon, pasta carbonara and a foie gras stack. The foie gras stack was a real standout. Tiny dining room but great spot to watch people walking up and down Hanover street. Good selection of wines. Two plate minimum. A nice addition to the North End.",4,2/12/2009,Carmelina's
14,"I'd like to reiterate that the food here is top notch. It is really delicious!And, as for the service, after the fact, it was absolutely superb. The owner of Damiano personally contacted me to apologize for my not-so-great experience with Damiano's service. Then, he insisted that I visit his friend at his restaurant in San Francisco (where I live!) and that his friend would take extra-special care of me and my boyfriend. Amazing! So go for the food and say hello to the amazing owner Damian for me!!!",5,2/13/2009,Carmelina's
15,"The food is fantastic and the wine by the glass selection is great.  So why only 3 stars?  First, it is so noisy it is impossible to conduct a conversation.  There is loud music playing on top of the loud din of conversation.  Next, the pace of the food service is so fast, it feels like a fast service restaurant (the TV on the wall adds to that feel).  We told our waiter that we wanted a slow pace, but he said the pace would be determined by the kitchen.  Thereafter, the food was set on our table so fast we couldn't keep up with it.  Once all the dishes were put on the table, our waiter disappeared and we had to track him down to get more wine.  We were never asked whether we wanted anything else - we were just handed the bill so that they could turn over the table.  A friend of mine mentioned that the best time to go is on a week night and to only order a couple of dishes at a time.  That will probably work if you can find the waiter when its time to add to your order.  The kitchen needs to really chill out so that diners can relax.  And turn down the music!",3,2/17/2009,Carmelina's
16,"The food here is simply amazing. I've been telling all of my friends! I've been here twice and had the sea scallops (to die for), the caprese salad, the lamb, the butternut squash risotto and the calamari. Everything was great. The decor and ambience are really modern and provide for a much different experience than the rest of the North End..(that's a good thing..)My only complaint has been with the service. The last server I had was messy, careless and impatient. My other experience I was served the incorrect risotto, however this mistake was promptly fixed. Hopefully they're able to beef up the experience a bit.",4,2/25/2009,Carmelina's
17,"Damiano is a incredible restaurant! They serve piattini plates similar to tapas but Italian styleThe decor is loving, the bathroom is clean , modern and the kitchen is right there in the center for you to view ..... You know who is cooking your food and it's piping hot when you get it. I like the style of getting your food (paced) served to according to how long it takes to prepared.....  as it's made..... I enjoy this style of delivery... because it reminds me of eating with my family in stages and it keeps coming.... The serves makes you feel like your at home warm and comfortable and the waiters are soo good looking... Your  waiter can be found in a second and is a delighted to serve you with charm and quick wit..... ask for Nick I would definitely recommend the seared sea scallops  , the Romanian salad, the soups and shrimp seafood pasta dishes. The owner chef comes to your table and says hi and that is a plus in my book! Great wines for good prices. In the summer , the glass windows open up and you can view the street of Hanover. I gonna keep on going back and try everything on the menu",5,3/1/2009,Carmelina's
18,"I have to agree with all of the positive reviews. Especially Lori V. We ate here recently and can not wait to go back! We also had Nick as a server and he was FANTASTIC, very charming and witty, (not to mention very handsome!) It was our first time dining at Damiano. We were familiar with the ""tapas style"" but were a bit unsure as to how to decide on what to pick/how many plates to pick/etc... so because we thought everything on the menu sounded delicious (which is rare) we decided to allow him to chose for us! And he seemed quite enthused on doing so. So he started us off with a tuna carpaccio topped with extra virgin olive oil gelato... absolutely to die for! Our second course was a REAL carbonara.. no cream, no peas! And again, amazing! We finished with the sea bass pistachio, finished with a saffron blood orange sauce. This was our favorite! And also a black garlic filet mignon which was cooked to a perfect medium rare! Overall this could be one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Everything was perfect from the front to the back of the house.",5,3/1/2009,Carmelina's
19,"Yesterday my husband and I did a double date to the North End.  We did not plan where we would go but rather stumbled into this establishment because none of us had ever been.  I always love new places and have sympathy for the growing pains of a new business, especially a restaurant.  In this case however the service was so awful I was beyond irritated, and the food hardly compensated.  I am not easily impressed by the fact the portions are so small they seem like they should taste delicious but no matter how many drizzles or creams you place on my plate I can not ignore the fact my food was just not good.  Perhaps it was the fact that by the time the rest of my table got their plates I had my food sitting in front of me for over ten minutes so it was dried up and rubbery (I had the stuffed calamari).  I would assume by the two mediocre pieces of Calamari that they could at least cook them so they wouldn't taste like a tire but appearance is deceiving.  Unfortunately our waitress also ignored us for the first about 15 minutes we were sitting, and in a place that accommodates approximately 15 tables it is hard to not notice a table of four staring around distressed.   The only way we got her attention was by asking the hostess where she was.  After we placed our drink orders she forgot half the order which was only waters all around and then when we requested waters she brought ONE!  Our meals came out separately with several minutes in between which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  The first meal that came to the table was mistakenly given to our table then removed a few minutes later for another table.   I will never return here because you would think $140 would fill up four people or at least be delicious but alas I left starving and annoyed with just how long we were there sitting twiddling our thumbs.",1,3/29/2009,Carmelina's
20,"I am a cynic when it comes to North End restaurants. I've lived in the neighborhood and worked the bar at a lot of them. That's why I was ecstatic when I found Ristorante Damianos. It's charming, with pictures of the chef's family in Italy blown up on the wall and a friendly bar scene where you can watch Damian comprise his surprising concoctions. The tuna meatballs are so good, they are actually worth driving around the neighborhood trying to score street parking so you don't get ripped off by the valets that have taken over Hanover Street. The spaghetti carbonara is so amazing, I have friends who have dreamt about it. (Okay, the friends are actually me.) The artichoke salad is comprised of, gee, delicious  fresh artichokes. This tapas-like eatery is a welcome addition to the North End. Best of all, the tourists are actually hip in here. There is a reason the Boston Globe called it one of the city's best new hotspots.",5,4/2/2009,Carmelina's
21,The few small plates we had while sitting at the bar where Ok but definitely over priced. We did however enjoy the mini bottles of prosecco that turn out to be more than 1 full glass for a reasonable $8 or $9. I am only giving three stars because of the price and also because the service was not the most friendly. At this time when spending is under scrutiny I am not sure I would go back here.,3,4/3/2009,Carmelina's
22,"I took a year off after college many years ago and traveled through Italy with friends. I came to love the food like it was a part of me. My wife and I get a chance to go to Boston three or four times a year, and we always go to the North End to eat. Over the many years we have found some we call our favorites, and I am always hesitant to try something new. My wife convinced me to try the new place Damiano on Hanover Street, and I can say without hesitation, it's my new favorite, not plural. The small plates, the smells, the atmosphere, everything reminded of my days in Italy. It actually reminded me of the little places in Sicily I used to love to go to eat.  This is a very good, authentic Italian restaurant, from the food right down to the wait staff.  You can't go wrong here, period.",5,4/20/2009,Carmelina's
23,"Ate there last night. Great selection of $20-$25 bottles of wine and the small plate approach allows you to try many things without being totally stuffed (2 plates per person at $10-$15 per plate is the norm). We had the spaghetti carbonara, the tuna meatballs (a bit bland, but good), the spicy shrimp and the mushroom risotto. All were very well prepared and had that special touch you expect from an Italian place on the North End. Service was great and very personable. Another plus, the decor was nice and kitchen is RIGHT there in case you enjoy watching the chef cook.",4,4/30/2009,Carmelina's
24,"The horrid service completely undermined the EXCELLENT food.Food was brought out very sporadically throughout the meal, and the waitress made many timing-related mistakes.  Initially - for example, when the bread was brought (apologetically) to us after we had already finished our 1st course - I didn't care.But then, all main courses were served except for mine.  Again, at first I waited patiently - I was sharing a 2nd dish with someone else, so had something to eat while I waited.Then the waitress came over to check how our meal was before I even had mine!  I answered 'it's good, but I'm still waiting for my pasta', and she acted like it was intentional that I didn't have my dish - her explanation was that we were all supposed to be sharing all the dishes, so it shouldn't matter if something comes out later than the rest.  But - it was obvious that we WEREN'T all sharing all the dishes - our orders were taken by person, no extra plates were given as is usually the case in 'family style' serving.  And besides, I actually WAS sharing with someone else at the table, and we had already finished the 2 other dishes we had ordered!So - this is the worst part - everyone finished their food, and the waitress was CLEARING THE TABLE - and my pasta STILL had not even been made!  As she was clearing the table, I asked her again about it, and she didn't really say anything - just ran back to the kitchen.  Then, she came back about 10 minutes later with THE WRONG DISH!  Finally - after we were all REALLY done with dinner - my pasta came.  They gave an extra serving and small plates to the rest of the table so I wouldn't have to eat alone.  Nice enough, but really the LEAST possible compensation given the circumstances.TO THE MANAGEMENT: I hope, for your own sake, that you can improve your service.   I would love to refer others to Damiano's based on the fantastic food and exciting menu.  But I can't - the service so completely destroyed my experience.",2,5/13/2009,Carmelina's
25,"Favorite spot in Boston, hands down.  Food is amazing, not too pricey and what a good concept (italian tappas).  If you are looking for something in the North End, Italian, different this is a must try and you will fall in love.  Have a cigar across the street after for an amazing evening.  Make sure you order 2-3 plates, under that is not enough and over that is stuffing your face and contributing to America's already overly obese society.",5,6/5/2009,Carmelina's
26,"My wife and I had recently dined at Damiano and had a fairly good experience but if you are looking for a fun and relaxing place to go this will NOT be your best choice. The place is small and VERY fast paste, not somewhere where you can sit and enjoy your time. The restaurant has an open kitchen with a screaming chef who is over powering the music. Our server came over almost crying after being bed mouthed from the chef in front of the entire restaurant. We felt absolutely uncomfortable. Food is good and the idea of italian tapas is very clever but it's not something outstanding or mind blowing for a $150 dinner for two. We left the restaurant extremely distressed of the way the staff was being treated and the rush of the atmosphere. I hope you all have a better experience then we did.",3,6/8/2009,Carmelina's
27,"We had a wonderful dinner there last night.  We had a large group, the staff did a great job serving, amazing service, and, the food was fantastic. Highly recommend the baby eggplant, and cod.  Loved the atmosphere.",4,7/4/2009,Carmelina's
28,"Although the service can sometimes be uneven (though in my experience never unfriendly, just overwhelmed), this is one of my favorite spots in Boston.  Sure, it's loud and crowded, but you're on Hanover Street, not at a corner table at The Oak Room.  The food is excellent, and I love the piattini or ""small plate"" concept because you get to try several things at once.  The wine list is tops, too.  Don't miss the risotto - it melts in your mouth.",5,7/8/2009,Carmelina's
29,"You must go to this place with an open and relaxed mind and you will definetly enjoy it. You should not act like spoiled Americas and enjoy the chaotic Italian experience. MUST MUST MUST have the seared scallops in grapefruit sauce. I like this restaurant because they dont give you a basket of bread to fill up on and the portions are small and delicious. This is one of the most authentic spots in the North End. The owner and his daughter are almost always in and they will make sure that you have the best experience possible. Re,ember this place is barely one year old.",4,7/9/2009,Carmelina's
30,"I went here for a friend's birthday last week. The birthday chose this place because it has italian tapas, and thought it was something different. The atmosphere was nice. Clean restaurant. However, the music was very loud (club style) and techno! Random, but a little bit too loud and too fast for my taste. You have to talk loudly when speaking to your dining companion. The service is decent. It is very fast. I think the food came out faster than we got our wine! The portions are ok. For tapas, I think the portions are fine but they are priced more than the usual ($8-13) range. In the North End, I feel like you can get probably pay the same amount of money for a regular sized dish with more food -- and the same sort of ""nice"" atmosphere. However, all in all, decent quality food, decent service.. I probably wouldn't come here again since there are so many other better places in the North End.",3,7/10/2009,Carmelina's
31,"Why I'll go back:  A delicious and varied menu in a charming spaceYou HAVE to order:  Carbonara (pasta), Figs wrapped in prosciutto (when in season)Tony's Tip:  They DO take reservations the day you plan to dineI think Damiano is one of the most underrated restaurants in Boston.  The menu is quite diverse, the food is very flavorful, and the entire place is pretty cozy, but with some electricity to it.  I'd absolutely put it on my short list of ""can't miss"" date spots, though you may want to go on the early side, before it gets really loud.  I've been there twice, on a Friday, during prime dinner hours (6:00-8:00), and neither time did I have to wait for a table (hadn't made a res).  There are probably only 10-12 tables in the place, plus some bar seats.  But it feels cozy, not cramped, and the decor is inviting (the sole bathroom is well-maintained too).  There are four tables positioned next to the open window, and I would try to grab one of those if the weather is cooperating.I've probably had about ten items from the extensive menu, and nothing was bad.  Yes, these are tapas, and the portions range from a typical appetizer to what I'd call a half-order entree.  That's what's so fantastic - you can ""sample"" a whole bunch of dishes to satisfy every craving you may have that evening.  The carbonara pasta and prosciutto-wrapped figs stand out, but the Sicilian tuna meatballs and garlic shrimp were also quite tasty.  My mom used to make spaghetti carbonara when I was a kid, and I just love the richness and consistency of that preparation.  But it's not often on the menu at Italian restaurants, and if I make an off-the-menu request, it's hit-or-miss.  Damiano hits the mark with this dish.  The figs we had were a special that night, and I was told were served when in season.  So, if you're going in the next month or two, definitely order them.  I did like the tuna meatballs, which were not particularly dense, and may have been a bit dry all by themselves.  But they were served in a sea of sweet and sour tomato sauce that created a great contrast.  The garlic shrimp was potent, and the shrimp were anything but small.  Plus, they were served atop a generous helping of sauteed spinach.  We had a great, and affordable bottle of Pinot Grigio..which reminds me - our waiter John was accomodating to our request to stagger the delivery of our six dishes, and he knew the wine list well.I will offer a heads up that many dishes here are swimming in a pool of oil, butter, garlic, etc.  So, expect to put your diet on hold, and embrace the night!",5,8/15/2009,Carmelina's
32,"Went here last Saturday night. Pros: Food was great. Each dish consistently good. Cons: PRICE, noise, temperature. We went here this past weekend because we had heard about this place on the Phantom Gourmet (which we have learned is really just a long commercial for whoever pays them to review their restaurant). Damiano's is a newcomer to the North End. And, like all new places, they have to try to hook the public with a gimmick. Theirs is to do ""italian-tappas"" which I've never seen before. We thought we'd try it out. We went on Saturday, during the weekend of the 99th annual Fisherman's Feast here in the North End. We went around 7PM. Streets were MOBBED. I was afraid we would have a huge wait - we had no reservation - but we were seated within 15 minutes of showing up. They do a quick turnaround here - get ya in, get ya drunk, and kick ya out. Hot. HOT! The weather was hot and humid all day and it didn't taper off after the sun went down. This place had their front open to the street - their giant door-windows were completely open. And as a result, the restaurant was way too hot and muggy. We were sweating bullets just sitting still. That's kinda gross. LOUD! Holy macinoli - horrible place for a first date! I pity the couples there that were trying to talk. Impossible. I have to listen to my girl all day - so I didn't mind that I couldn't hear her for once! The music here was bizarre - like I said, a new place is trying new things so they play this bizarre techno-electronic rock? It doesn't work. Especially with their old-school black-and-white North End art on the walls. OK So - loud and hot. Let's get to the good stuff: Our waitress was great - Sara - CUTE! And she knows her stuff. She upsold me to a bottle of wine - which I did love - but I was thinking she was pretty smooth to pull that over on an old dog like me. Sucker for a pretty face, I guess. They do express upon you that they ""strongly suggest"" you order 2-3 dishes each. OK Don't worry - we'll spend money - sheesh! Kind of annoying but I expected it. We ordered 4 different dishes. She brought us 2 little bruschetta things - nice. I noticed different tables got different things. Some got rolls, we got this. Cute. Each dish arrived separately so you had a chance to finish the first one. We got the scallops with angel hair - we both loved it. Lobster risotto - that was my favorite. Filet with ""black garlic"" sauce - also very good. Least favorite was their ""spicy alfredo"" dish which I didn't think was spicy or cheesy enough but - 3 our of 4 ain't bad. EXPENSIVE! 4 small dishes and a bottle of wine run you $100. But we did have a good time despite the temperature and noise. We really are in it for the food - and it won us over, hands down. So - if not for us sweating the whole time and the noise factor - it'd be 5 stars for sure.",4,8/17/2009,Carmelina's
33,A perfect combination of traditional Italian fare and more experimental contemporary flare.The piattini plates make it a fabulous night out with friends and the wine selection is ideal for getting lost with a lover.I can't wait to try it again and again...because you have to in order to try all the yumminess on the extensive menu.,5,8/24/2009,Carmelina's

35,"We decided to go into the North End this evening - something we do every 2-3 months. On one of our previous trips we remarked how the Cafe' Grafitti was no longer there and a new restaurant had sprung up in it's place. ""We'll have to try it"", we told ourselves.Well, tonight was the night that we decided to give Ristorante Damiano a try. The Service: Our waiter (Nick) was SUPERB! Very knowledgeable about the menu and not afraid to tell us what some of his favorites were. When one member of our party told him what he was thinking of, he wasn't shy about saying, ""It is an excellent choice, but I'll just mention that there is pasta in other things you are ordering and pasta in this one as well. I just bring that up because I don't want you to feel like you had too much pasta. If you want lobster in another dish, I would recommend ...""  I like a waiter that does that. What we ordered:We ordered a couple of salads, the lamb lollipops, mussels, the suppe di pesce, and lobster fra diavlo.The Food:When each dish arrived, we all agreed that each item was delicious. The quality of the ingredients and the pairings of flavors were really very good. Food came to our table in waves, starting with the salads, and it almost seemed like someone was watching to see if we were finished with our first selection so they could bring the next one. I don't know whether to credit Nick or the kitchen or both, but we didn't have to wait more than a couple of minutes between finishing one plate and being given another.The value:The value is the reason I didn't give Ristorante Damiano five stars. You can get a lot of great food in the North End. Although we felt the quality and service were both excellent, we spent $200 for a meal for 3 people. Our feeling was that we could have eaten at other restaurants in the North End and had really good food (maybe not QUITE as good) for close to half of what we spent here.  The Positives:Quality of the food and the serviceThe Negatives:For me it was the perceived value, the noise of the street (like motorcycles starting their engines just a few feet away from you with the windows wide open) and the annoying techno music they play.",3,9/26/2009,Carmelina's

37,"OK, Oh MY!  Some friends took me here last week for my birthday; and the food and atmosphere was amazing.  We all ordered the tapas and lots of wine; and everything was perfect.  Especially excellent......Braised Mushrooms over warm goat cheese.....

38,"Well, i didn't get a chance to get here during the summer but I did return!  At the last minute we decided to not cook dinner and wanted some place low key.  I remembered Damiano's and was in the mood for small plates.  We only had to wait 15 minutes on a Friday with no reservation.  We were seated and given a taste of the pumpkin soup.  Yummy and satisfying! Our waiter was John and very friendly.  We got a great bottle of wine for $25.  We shared 4 small plates.  We tried the beet salad, tuna ""meat' balls, figs, and pumpkin ravioli.  The figs and ravioli were definitely the highlights of the meal.  I'm still thinking about the ravioli actually.  The figs were encrusted with almonds and topped with cheese.  So. Good. The restaurant is small, cozy, and inviting.  Great neighborhood spot with excellent service and fantastic innovative food.",5,10/30/2009,Carmelina's
39,"I live in the North End, which has always been plagued by the traditional spaghetti and meatball shops and chicken marsala old school restaurants. In the past few years we've seen great restaurants open up and bring exciting food and great atmosphere to the North End.Tonight, I went to Damiano's for the first time. ""Italian tapas"" was how it was pitched to me. Hm, love tapas, love Italian. I'm in. I first fell in love with the chocolate brown faux croc booth coverings against the rustic brick. Very chic. The restaurant is small but is well decorated with several high tables and great ""sushi-bar-like"" seating along with 2 and 4 tops along the wall.The food was amazing. We started with the beet salad, grilled calamari and pea and prosciutto risotto. Moved on to the lamb chops in a pistachio mint sauce, sea bass with wild mushrooms, fettuccine alfredo and seared scallops. Everything was cooked to order, they even accommodated two small kids with a great dish of pasta and meatballs, although my daughter's favorite was the lamb chops:)Loved every bite. Great service and a fun atmosphere - not your traditional North End. HIghly recommend it.",5,11/24/2009,Carmelina's
40,"I wish my first-ever Yelp review could be positive, but it can't be. My sweetie took me to Ristorante Damiano in Boston's North End and we were so bothered by the treatment we received from the management that we feel compelled to Yelp about it. First of all, I'll say that my sweetie took me there because she'd been there twice (while in Boston on business) and wanted me try to try their Carbonara. We're both good cooks and we think we know good from bad. I'll also say that I lived in this neighborhood for a year and there are fabulous restaurants including the Daily Catch and Giacomo's. So we were enthusiastic. We put our name down and said we'd wait for a window table because the other tables are too noisy for us. The hostess offered to ring our cell phone, saying we'd be seated in about 20 minutes -- very sweet. And she did call, after just 20 minutes, but it turns out that was for one of the tables we said we didn't want. She was apologetic and said it'd probably be another 20 minutes before a window table opened up. No worries, we said. Busy night. Good for them. We came back 15 minutes later and stood there while two ""two-top"" tables by the window opened up and were then combined to create a four-top which was then given to someone else. That was a little annoying, but okay. We were told we'd get the very next table. So we waited some more. After a total of an hour of waiting, another table opened up by the window. Guess what -- they sat a foursome there. At that point we complained. The manager came out and gave us a line of hooey. Told us that they'd been on the list ahead of us, which was simply untrue. Apologized and offered to bring us each a glass of wine while we waited, which he didn't. Ten minutes later, we got seated. The food was fine, very tasty but not remarkable. We were intent on enjoying our meal -- we were starving! Guess what -- the bill came and we were billed for the wine. We mentioned to the waiter that the manager had offered to buy us a glass of wine for our troubles. Guess what -- the manager came over as said there must be a misunderstanding. The comp wine was offered while we were waiting outside. The offer wasn't good for when we got inside. Unbelievable. We appreciate that the restaurant is small and that the manager wants to fill every table -- it's a tough economy -- but that's no way to treat customers. Short-sighted. Small-minded. Worst of all, dishonest. My advice: bring three friends or be prepared to be ignored. Better yet: don't go.",1,12/4/2009,Carmelina's
41,"This restaurant is incredible! I live in San Francisco and was there for the first time in August--sat at the open window and enjoyed a delicious meal, great wine, and unbeatable service. When I returned to Boston in December I couldn't wait to get there for my birthday dinner and it was even better than I had remembered! We sat at the same table, this time looking out at the snow and the Christmas lights. The seared sea scallops stole the show, but everything was really tasty and cooked to perfection.Thank you Damiano's, you make my Boston experience better each time and I can't wait to return!!!",5,12/17/2009,Carmelina's
42,"you'd think with small plates you can avoid being a piggy.  but that's hard to do here. esp. if you sit at the bar & get to see the busy chefs turning out orders(and passing out treats). a few of favorites: fried calamari, lamb lollipops, braised beef short ribs w/ polenta, sautéed scallops(wow), sicilian tuna meatballs, veal valdostana & gambas. and that filet with garlic sauce! ideally, all in one seating. i don't get back here often enuff. if Damiano was in the south end, i'd be a complete fatty by now.",4,12/17/2009,Carmelina's
43,"I've been to Damiano's three times and I've loved everything I've tried there.  I love getting to try several dishes and sharing with friends.  It was really fun to sit at the chef's table and watch how they effortlessly create small dish after dish to perfection.  I loved the meatballs, the risotto, and the scallop special I got.  The only complaint I have is that the service was a little slow.  I'd recommend calling ahead of time to put your name down since they don't take reservations.",5,2/1/2010,Carmelina's
44,"Unimpressed.  Basically, you pay about the same amount per item as you'd pay at places just down the street, but you get a lot less food that's not quite as good (and so you have to order multiple dishes to make a full meal).  The concept of small plates so that you can sample lots of things is nice, but to make it work they need one of two things: 1.) Really good food, so you don't mind shelling out twice what you'd pay at a standard North End Italian place OR 2.) Lower prices so that you can try lots of different things for a reasonable price.  Without one of those two things, the concept just doesn't work. We had short rib ravioli, which were well cooked but nothing special--the meat tasted good, but had no texture, and the sauce was a chef-boy-r-d consistency and flavor (not that there's anything wrong with that--it's just cheaper to buy it in the can).  The beef carpaccio was fine, but seemed to be trying a bit too hard with excessive truffle oil.  And the spicy alfredo dish with sausage and chicken was just ok.  I don't mind paying for a great meal, and I love food enough to enjoy even just a so-so meal.  But a restaurant should know which one it's going to provide.  Ristorante Damiano thinks they're great but aren't, and that's frustrating. Also, they charge for soda refills.  Who does that?",2,2/17/2010,Carmelina's
45,"I'm from Chicago, so I normally don't get the experience of the Italian North End, but this restaurant was very good nonetheless.  The decor was very modern, not a huge seating area, but plenty of tables with a bar area.  the kitchen and Chefs are situated along the bar, so if you sit at the bar, which is where I sat, you can see the chefs cooking and everything else they are doing, including their conversations, lol.The waitress was attentive and when I asked her about their risottos, she recommended all the ones they serve, and explained the differences of them.  I told her I didn't like olives and she said that she could have the chefs adjust the dish, but I don't believe in ""that,"" but it was definitely nice of her to offer.I ordered the Mussels and Peas/Priscutto risotto.  The mussels came out quickly and were very good, the mussels were fresh and the sauce was light yet very very tasty, if I was at home I would have put it in a cup so I could drink it outright lol.  I was provided bread to use to soak up and eat the sauce.  The Priscutto came out a little later, and it was served in a small bowl, but it was more than enough to fill me.  All around it was really delicious, very rich.My bill after tip was close to $40, and all i had was water. and this was just for lunch! but it was good.",4,2/19/2010,Carmelina's
46,"After seeing an around-the-corner-line for Giacomo's and no openings at Pomodoro, my boyfriend and I decided to walk down Hanover until we found something that looked good--Damiano is right next to Pomodoro so we checked the menu and decided it looked good (an entire vegetarian section which is great for me)--and that the prices were even better. We only had to wait five minutes for a table, but upon being seated we learned that they serve ""piatinnis""--translation ""small plates."" That explained the relatively cheap prices. In order to get enough food for two people, you need to order at least three dishes. (They range from $10-$18.) I felt a little misled, but bf and I were happy to have a table at a nice place on a Sat. night so we went for it--and I am so glad we did! Bread: two breadsticks, one dinner roll and two little cups of unexpectedly delicious mushroom soup--an interesting sub for olive oil, but great for dipping the bread!Baby Eggplant--sliced eggplant, fried and topped with a light tomato sauce and parmesan--think Eggplant Parm without the pasta. YUM.Wild Mushroom Risotto--amazingness. Bf had never had ristto but he loves mushrooms so I chose this for us--he was a big fan. Pasta Carmelina--our waiter said this was a favorite and the bf agreed--spaghetti with giant scallops, shrimp, chicken and sausage--I had a few bites of the spaghetti and the sauce alone was incredible.We also got a bottle of Pinot Noir for $25--the cheapest bottle they had...still very good. They do not serve dessert or coffee which I thought was strange--on the back of their menu they encourage you to ""experience the North End"" by having dessert at one of the many cafes or gelaterias because they are the 'true professionals' of dessert."" We took their advice and went to Caffe Vittoria across the street--see separate review for that. Overall, a great experience. Friendly, knowledgable waiter, delicious food that fills you up without making you feel like you just ate a house (which tends to be the case at most Italian restaurants for me...) This would be a fun place to come with a group and try a lot of different things on the menu.",4,2/20/2010,Carmelina's
47,"I went to damiano last night with a couple of girlfriends and was disappointed. While the service was fantastic, the food was mediocre and expensive. The portions are small and you'll need several entrees to fill you up (think italian tapas). We had the house salad, squash ravioli, seabass and rissoto. All were OK. The flavors were bland even though the presentation was nice, we were unimpressed. It feels like they're trying too hard and something just ain't working. Will not go back. There are plenty of alternatives in the area.",3,3/10/2010,Carmelina's
48,"The food here is truly delicious.  Sure, some dishes stand out more than others (the short rib ravioli and the risotto with peas and prosciutto were heads above everything else we ordered), but they are all solid dishes.  Even the rare ahi tuna, which I thought was kind of a wild card at an Italian tapas place, was fantastic and actually a nice, light, in-between dish to balance out the heavier pastas.  Our server was that perfect combination of professional and laid back and we all loved her.  The food came out quickly, we had a nice little table up front, and everyone we encountered was perfectly pleasant.  So, why not 5 stars for Damiano's?  I felt rushed.  And a little cramped.  And did I mention rushed?  We had a reservation, but it was on the early side so we were politely told about the party waiting for our table when we finished our meal.  That and they only serve beer and wine.  Granted, the beer was great, but it's always nice to have options.  Good thing the food menu takes care of that for Damiano's.",4,3/15/2010,Carmelina's
49,"I love little food. Tapas. Piattini. Sfizi. Whatever you want to call them. If it's tasty and Lilliputian, I am on that like white on rice. (Also, I STILL don't understand that phrase and if someone could essplain it to me, that'd be great.)Ristorante Damiano is itself a little piattini of a restaurant. It seats maybe forty in a squarish dining room. There's a tiny exhibition kitchen in the corner with a bar lining one side and a service station along the other, and big windows that open up onto Hanover Street (which is really quite pleasing, given that it gets balls-hot with the kitch open like that.) The place is dim, pseudo-sexy, and oddly-decorated; the giant rose statue in a vase of foil-wrapped Hershey Kisses looks like something you'd find in a tacky Italian-by-way-of-Vegas restaurant on V-Day. Looks can be misleading. The food at Damiano's is classy, tasty, and truly worth it. (Unless you want dinosaur-sized platters of meat. In which case, I would refer you to your local steakhouse and/or fast food establishment. Portions here are indeed small, and if you are looking to be stuffed like a Christmas goose, ain't gonna happen here.)Of note: the beef carpaccio, drizzled with just the right amount of truffle oil and shaved Parmesan. The cheese was nutty, the truffle oil earthy, and the beef melted away on the tongue. Also fantastic were the mussels. The broth was lemony and rich and begged to be mopped up with some crusty bread. Short rib ""pasta pillows"" were unbelievable, though ""pasta pillow"" is such a dumb term, I was tempted to order something else because I can't say ""pasta pillow"" without thinking it's a pejorative term for the female genitalia. Alas, the cognac demi-glace on my pillows was good enough to lick off the plate. (I restrained myself, mostly, as one should never lick their own pillows.) Pumpkin ravioli were sweet with mascarpone; the sage in the sauce kept them from being cloying. A filet rubbed down with black garlic was perfectly cooked at medium rare, and actually quite sizable at a good 3-4 ounces.Service is friendly, casual and professional. Our server told us to feel free to shout at him if we wanted anything, anything at all. (Given the deafening volume of the restaurant on a Saturday night, shouting is necessary. Hand signals and written signs are also a good idea.) We didn't receive our courses at the same time, which was only a little bit annoying. Only other crappy aspect: our table had to ask for bread multiple times; on each go-round, we received one small slice which, though proportional to the portion size, was kind of a pain in the butt. With such good sauces and dippy things, bread is vital. I hated having to call someone over for every course and feeling like a fatty trying to fill up on the free bread during Restaurant Week. Don't be stingy, Damiano; give us a basket!I can see how the prices on the regular dinner menu could be steep, if you were absatoots starving. But TBH, I was perfectly full after three plates and a couple glasses of wine. The food is rich, especially the meat and pasta dishes. No dessert so stop at Modern for a cannoli; you'll be just fine.Damiano is a great alternative to all of the red-sauce joints in the North End. A solid four stars. Hell, four and a half, I'm feeling generous.",4,3/21/2010,Carmelina's
50,"The food was really tasty, however it was extremely over priced. My friend loves this place hands down, however I found it to be good food at a unnecessarily high price.It was a fun atmosphere with a great menu. I will have to try it again as it seems everyone else liked it much more.",3,3/22/2010,Carmelina's
51,My favorite place to dine in the North End. It's tapas style but some of the dishes are fairly larger than that. Pan seared scallops and petite filet are my standard order. The sauce on both dishes are just fantasmic. I would lick the plate if people weren't watching. Small space and can get crowed during the weekends. Also there is a 4 dish minimum for 2 or more people Fri-Sun. Can get a little pricey but I find that is fine since I only go occassionaly.,5,6/26/2010,Carmelina's
52,"Disappointing brunch. Had to convince the hostess/waitress/foodrunner to let us come in and eat, as we were starving and wanted to also watch the US World Cup match. We went round and round with her about it being some kind of cusp between the brunch and dinner menus, we convinced her that we were just starving and would order from any menu. They do not close for a transition. Ultimately ordered brunch and a beer. Food was fine, if unremarkable. I had the (4 large and tender) scallops and my friend had the chicken (3 small pieces), which were essentially the same dish -- with a lemon and caper (piccata) sauce -- over spinach. The spinach sure seemed, horrors, like the frozen kind. Other friend ordered a frittata. No starch served. Turns out the host/waitress/foodrunner's quandary was that she would have to leave when the dinner menu started, so she rushed us to pay as we were still eating. We paid, including the 20% tip, then never saw another server or staff person again. Bread would have been nice, dessert would have been nice, coffee would have been nice, volume for the final US World Cup game would have been nice, and entrees all served at the same time would have been nice. Lots of things would have been nice.",2,6/27/2010,Carmelina's
53,"Best food, flavor and portion sizes in all the North End. We went last night and sat at the bar area that overlooks the chef, Damion, showing off his tremendous culinary skills. Loved the seating-we both are big foodies and it was nice to see all the different plates coming together. We started with the muscles-light broth, very nice. In the past we have tried the Crazy Alfredo-which is DELICIOUS, but we had the carbonara (hands down outstanding), the carmelina (chicken, shrimp, sausage, pasta in a tangy sauce), and the short rib ravioli. The ravioli was nice but I would have to say if I had a choice, i would go with the carbonara every time. We were so stuffed but the chef sent us over a taste of another dish he was making because we were enjoying our meal so much. Despite the fact that he had a packed house (on a tuesday night, no less), he still had time to fire out hot, delicious dishes and exchange some conversation with us. Please-give your business to Damiano when you're craving italian. It's a wonderful place and our new favorite...especially since we can head right across the street to Stanzi di Cigari afterwards for a nightcap!",5,8/4/2010,Carmelina's
54,"I used to go here all the time when they first opened, but I hadn't been in a few years until last weekend. Boy was it as good as I remembered.So while I usually avoid restaurants on Hanover St like the plague I really love this place. I like the open kitchen. I love the tables that are in the front where the wall gets opened up on nice days/evenings. I like the super friendly and knowledgeable staff. I love the selection of wines by the glass. I mean seriously I do not know of any other restaurant where you can order Barolo by the glass! Love the Italian tapas concept. About the only thing I don't like is that I have to fight through crowds of stupid tourists and gawkers on my way to the place.I have never had a single thing off their menu that I have not ended up loving. Some of the must haves are the mussels, any of their risottos & the lamb lollipops. They don't do desert like many of the other North End places, but do yourself a favor and skip Mikes or Modern and try Bova's which is better, cheaper & less crowded.",5,8/26/2010,Carmelina's
55,"St Anthony's feast was this past weekend, so we decided to have some lunch in the North End.  After walking around a bit and running into restaurants that were completely full or completely empty, we settled on Damiano based on the fact that the ceiling-to-floor windows were lowered so that we could people-watch!The atmosphere is nice - small, and I could imagine it being pretty cozy at night.My hubby and I shared the calamari fra diavolo pasta and the tuna sandwich.  Both of which were really good but not spectacular.What stood out was the service - it wasn't very good.  We looked wistfully at the couple at the table next to us who were getting water and bread the minute they sat down.  Ours didnt' come until halfway into the meal, when we requested it.  The waitress flew by our table just to drop off our dishes and didn't seem to care much about anything else.  When we finished our meal, it took about 15 min to get her attention to get the check.Would be interested to come back for the tapas-themed dinner but the service has left a little bit of a bad impression.",3,8/30/2010,Carmelina's
56,"I came in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon with 7 other people. The place itself is a bit small, but it wasn't too crowded. All in all, I'd have to say that the food was good but the experience was not.A huge pet peeve of mine is when food doesn't come out on time at a restaurant. I understand that sometimes the server may have made a mistake, or the kitchen misfired a dish, however this was just ridiculous. My lunch companions ordered dishes ranging from the risotto, chicken piccata, and chicken parm and meatball sandwiches. I ordered the lamb lollipops. The risotto dishes came out first. 10 minutes later the sandwiches came out. The chicken piccatas came out another 10-15 mins later. I was still waiting for my lamb while my companions were finishing up their dishes. I got so frustrated that I ended up canceling my dish. The waitress was very apologetic and in the end she brought out the dish for me saying that it was on the house. The pistachio crusted lamb was cooked well and was quite tastey. However, I wish I could have just properly enjoyed the dish.",3,9/27/2010,Carmelina's
57,Unless you're blond with a big rack don't expect any service.  Portions were very small off the entre menu and just decent as far as taste.  Boston so far has been a culinary high for us but this place was the one let down - my suggestion: try out one of the many alternative italian restaurants in the area instead.,1,10/1/2010,Carmelina's

We were seated immediately and the waiter came by our table in less than 2 minutes. Our table was right in front of the large window which was great for people watching. It was explained to us that it is an ""Italian tapas"" restaurant. They recommend 2 to 3 dishes per person. Between the two of us, we had 5 and it was too much. By far and away, the best dish we had was the pumpkin ravioli. Do yourself a favor and order this when you go... its outstanding. I also ordered the fillet mignon (it was a special) and it was cooked perfectly.They only have beer and wine and the wine selection isn't that great.  Might want to see if you can BYOB.All in all, I would highly recommend this eatery.",4,10/4/2010,Carmelina's

63,"Ok, here it is, a review WAY over due!! Ristorante Damiano's is by far my girlfriend and I favorite restaurant. We had dinner there last Saturday evening, though a high top with friends is always fun fighting over tapas.  Call it date night if you will. Anyways. As you walk in the Restaurant it's fun and vibrant, servers bustling around with bottles of wine and specials to recite. I even noticed the owner himself is on the floor greeting, serving, recommending food and cooking of course!!! That is always nice to see, a restaurant with passion. What I love about this place is DUH the food, service and ambiance. I love to go there and just order like crazy. It's Tapas so you have to have at least three, plus there exciting. In one seating you can explore many different tastes which the best part of the experience. If you don't love to share you should begin to here, cause that's were the fun is at Damiano's. Everyone can taste a littlesomething!!! We began with a Carpaccio style beet salad served with arugula, goat cheese, and toasted Pinoli nuts!!! We also shared a few succulent sea Scallops to start it off. After that we decided to split the Spaghettini alla Puttanesca (spicy tomato sauce, capers, anchovy, olives, basil. (I wish I ordered that on my own). Then we finished the night off with a a Filet Mignon in a tangy balsamic vinaigrette and also the Sea Bass wrapped in pancetta over fingerling potatoes!

64,"This was undoubtedly one of my least enjoyable dining experiences in the North End. Considering all the great reviews, you're probably wondering why...On a good note, I love seeing a tapas style concept melded with one of my favorite styles of cuisine: Italian! We ordered a wide variety of small plates so we could get a good sampling of what Damiano has to offer (fish, meat, pasta, vegetarian options etc.).  Some dishes were remarkably good, others just good, and our least favorite was a ravioli dish that reminded us too much of Chef Boyardee.It wasn't so much the food that ruined the experience for us though. Instead it was the service and the atmosphere. I like to enjoy my meal. Take in the sights, smells, and sounds around me and while away with my guests, enjoying the flavors and feelings a dining experience should first give you and then send you away with.  Here we felt rushed, the service was cold and the atmosphere was just chaos. Don't come here for a date or if you are looking for any sort of intimate or homey feel. Sure, it's the North End, chaos at it's finest, but I've been to Giacomo's and other hopping spots in the area and still managed to always feel welcome and fully enjoy my meal.",3,12/6/2010,Carmelina's
65,"This place is delicious! It's great for vegetarians because they have a wide selection of dishes that is more than just pasta. The waitress also said they can cater to vegans which is nice. The vegetable, as well as the pasta, dishes my mom and I shared were so yummy and had so much flavor. I also love that the portions are small so you can try more things. We also didn't feel disgustingly full afterward like I do at most Italian restaurants. Our waitress, as well as the rest of the staff, were so wonderful and attentive. Can't wait to go back.",5,12/15/2010,Carmelina's
66,"I was up at the North End a few months ago getting some pastries.  It was a rainy day I just didn't feel like going home and cooking but I wanted some good Italian food from a place that I hadn't tried before.  I walked in and the atmosphere is great.  Service was excellent, and the food was amazing.  I sat at the bar which actually looks into the tiny kitchen and was immediately given a taste of their delicious mushroom soup.  I ordered the equivalent of an italian mimosa (blood orange juice and prosecco) and the Scallops Limone.  Oh my goodness.  The scallops were like butter and the combination of the lemon juice and the capers was perfect served over the bed of spaghettini.  I will be going here forever.",5,1/29/2011,Carmelina's
67,"Very nice!!! They have this concept of ordering smaller plates that you share with your table guests, like Tapas. Very fresh and healthy food. We just kept ordering :) This is a restaurant that doesn't want you out in half an hour, very nice. They don't serve coffee or desert, because other businesses in the North End have their specialty in that place. We liked this very much.",4,2/24/2011,Carmelina's

69,I was disappointed with Damianos.  We ordered multiple vegetable dishes which were extremely oily.  There were 4 of us and the meat dishes came with three tiny servings and were way overpriced.The owner was also extremely rude to us and the wait staff was mediocre.I definitely have had way better food in the North End and won't be returning.,2,3/8/2011,Carmelina's
70,"Honestly the food was average.   This may have been affected by the disposition of the chef and the overall service from the waitstaff.  The chef sets the tone for the restaurant and everything else follows his/her lead.  This manifested itself in the overall experience.Maybe I came on an off night (Thursday?) but, I sat at the bar where I thought I could catch a great viewing of the chef cooking.   The chef seemed disinterested, not engaging/sociable and unusually sharp with the waitstaff.  This was not a busy night by far (red flag?) so i'm puzzled by the relatively tense nature of the restaurant.  Overall I had an above average pasta bolognese.  I highly doubt it was homemade pasta due to the cook time and taste.  I was not about to even inquire about dessert as I had not inclination to spend another minute there.Bottom line....wouldn't go back.",2,3/11/2011,Carmelina's
71,"Went here for a Saturday lunch during restaurant week.  When we arrived, there was just another couple at a table.  It wasn't very busy which was good for us since the waiter was attentive.  That ended as more people started sitting down.  It took almost 10 minutes to get the check and another 10 for the credit card to be swiped, by another waiter!  The food was decent but the service was slow.  There was a lot of seafood on the menu which was surprising considering it's a prix fixed meal.  My entree was not too filling, small portion size and the pasta had a weird texture.",3,3/13/2011,Carmelina's
72,Service: Bad. I felt uncomfortable. The waiter was inconsiderate and not the nicest person.Food: Was great! Too small though. Entrees were more like appetizers.Setting: Simple. Not that pretty. Nothing special.Recommend: Nope.,3,3/17/2011,Carmelina's
73,"Here's the thing about Damiano's: The food is really quite good but the space is FAR too small and the whole ""small plate"" thing just doesn't quite work.I went here for restaurant week and maybe it's the fact that I spent $33.10 for what was essentially 3 appetizers but I left feeling unfulfilled.  The fried calamari, pasta in puttanesca sauce and chicken piccatta were all good and flavorful but there was just such little food.  And no dessert.It's a shame though because while tiny the space is charming and the waiter that we had was very friendly.  I probably won't go back.  It's just far too expensive to get enough food to amount to a true meal.",2,3/18/2011,Carmelina's
74,"Great Little Place.  In the heart of Little Italy it is nice to find a place with small plates!  Not the best I ate, but a couple of dishing were pretty freaking fantastic!Ordered:San Marzano Tomato Crostini - Fantastic - on point for sure!Brocolli Rabe? - great texture, perfectly cookedWild Mushroom Risotto - GET THIS, it is creamy, mushroom heaven!Puttanesca - pretty basic, but delishMeatballs - Score - great flavor, sauce, and textureHouse Salad - uninspired, basically mixed greens - pass!Had a great California Pinot by the glass and a fantastic Malbec by the glass.Would definitely return and have the Crostini, Risotto, Meatballs and try some other yummy looking items!",4,3/22/2011,Carmelina's

76,"I gave one star because the food was flavorful but not worth anymore because of the package at Gilt City that they offer was $135 worth of food and they offer it for %50 off.  Went there with my boyfriend and it was a deal for 4 courses per person.  I thought it'll be a good size per course. The very first 2 course was literally 1 bite.  The last 2 course are worth about 5 bites.  Plus the waiting time totaled at 2 hrs.  When we got the check, the waitress mentioned that the tips wasn't included in the package, I wasn't happy when she had to mention it to us.  We didn't would never go there again, the food was only worth 1/4 of what they sell it for.  We had to go to the nearby restaurant to have a real meal.  I would love to hear from others Gilt City ppl about this deal that they got for this restaurants.  I've learn my lesson, never take a deal that sounds too good to be true.",1,4/18/2011,Carmelina's
77,"Given the wonderful food and warm reception we received last night, I have a hard time imagining anyone working there last night was around the nights of the poor reviews.   We ate somewhere else (good, but not great), but stopped off here for a nightcap and a small plate.   We did not arrive until around 915, so the pressure seemed to be off everyone.Sat at the bar overlooking the chef, and everything we saw prepared looked super.  Chef actually described the preparation of several of the dishes.  This is NOT haute cuisine - no foams - but just good, old fashioned, honest Italian fare.  Steve was running the palace and was attentive despite having a VIP seated behind us.  Will go back for a full meal next time we are in town.",5,4/20/2011,Carmelina's
78,"The idea of small plates for Italian cuisine is great as long as they are not too small.  For the price, I was expecting more food.  As for the food....the meatballs were right on.  Just the right texture and the sauce was great.  My absolute favorite was the Pumpkin Ravioli.  The combo of savory and sweet....absolute perfection.  The Mussels Vapor with angel hair pasta were good as well.  I love going to a restaurant where the owner is working the room.  Damiano was right in the mix and made us feel right at home.",4,5/11/2011,Carmelina's

83,"I've had Damiano twice and loved it both times. It's not cheap and it's a tad cramped, but the food is mostly excellent and highly original. The service is friendly and generous--not to mention pretty good-looking--and for anyone used to ordering tapas, you can make out with a full stomach and a decent wine buzz for what's essentially in the reasonably good first date price range. As for all this whining about portion sizes, there's A FRIGGIN' SIGN ON THE DOOR, A DESCRIPTION ON THE MENU, AND THE WAIT STAFF USUALLY ASKS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO! The waitress will probably try to upgrade you on the wine bottle, but I've never regretted taking her advice--still, something to keep in mind if you'd rather steel your resolve ahead of time and save some cash.So then, to the food.The caprese salad is a nice starter: cool, fresh, flavorful. Share it with your companion, take a swig of some wine and get ready for the heat.The roasted fish was excellent. Sweet, firm, perfectly seasoned and nicely flaked in a light sauce. Mimmo's baked meatballs are that--meatballs. They taste amazing as meatballs typically do, they're served in a little plate swimming in tomato sauce. Nothing miraculous, but as meatballs go, they certainly get the job done.The filet mignon was perfectly cooked, so tender and tasty, with a little sauce but not so seasoned you can't taste the beef. This was beefy beef.Short rib ravioli melts in your mouth. In fact, I don't know that I've ever actually used the term ""melts in your"" with as much aptness as right now.Pumpkin raviolis. Lord, almighty, these pumpkin raviolis! Sweet! Savory! Perfectly textured! Delicate yet lingering! I was dreaming of their flavor for days! Just, for the love of all things orange, try the pumpkin raviolis!And when we were done, the nice waitress gave us some dessert and coffee recommendations.",4,6/23/2011,Carmelina's
84,"I took my niece here who has lived in Rome for the last year on and off, and we loved it! We had a Gilt City gift certificate which let us try four courses with three options each course. Everything was delicious! The shrimp scampi was amazing and so was the pistachio crusted sea bass. The atmosphere was great and I loved that the main wall opened out to the street so you could people watch and feel the breeze. I will definitely be going back, it was so good!!!! Ps they do not have dessert but there are of places near by that have them.",5,6/30/2011,Carmelina's

86,"Had a fantastic meal. Love how it is small plates so you can get lots of items and share. Had the eggplant, meatballs, a salad, the caprese risotto and they were all delicious. Best meal I have had in the North End. Service was definately a bit slow but the food made up for it.",5,7/12/2011,Carmelina's
87,"I see a theme developing here.... and I had the same experience - Great Food, Bad Service. I have been here twice, most recently a couple weeks ago with a friend from out of town. The service was slow, aloof - could basically care less. For the amount of restaurants with good food in the area - you really should be on your game. On to the food - we started with some Bellini's to drink which were nice and refreshing on this warm afternoon visit. We then shared the arugula salad, baby eggplant, and meatballs. Each dish was fresh and full of flavor. Too bad I probably will never recommend this place, or try it again for a long time",3,7/13/2011,Carmelina's
88,"Loved our experience here.  We were walking North End and tried Damiano on a whim.  The tapas-style dishes were a surprise but a lot of fun.  We put together a 3-course, great tasting, Italian meal and walked away not feeling as if we were going to explode.  Service was good and I loved seating next to the street watching people go by.",5,7/15/2011,Carmelina's
89,"Since we are incapable of getting up at a decent time on the weekend, leave it to the bf and I to look for brunch at 2:30pm on a Sunday.After a few missed opportunities, we give up and decide to wander into the North End and call it a day. Imagine our delight when we find brunch served until 3pm at Ristorante DamianoFor brunch, the Sicilian Mimossa was quite tasty, but I'm not sure it was worth $7. Shockingly, they don't serve bloody marys. I thought this was sacrilege, a massive sin upon the brunch gods. To make it worse, they also don't serve coffee. Really? An Italian place without coffee? That's fine. Whatever.I went with the Penne Gorgonzola pasta, which was nice... its hard not to make something like this too greasy and sadly, there was a tad bit of grease. The sundried tomatoes gave it a nice zing... for the most part, it was pretty tasty. Eric opted for a non-egg dish and went with the Wild Mushroom Risotto. It was servicable enough but we both preferred my dish. The entire place is tiny. I can imagine it really sucks on a busy night... That, and I might I mention that the description for Penne Gorgonzola is hilarious... it's one word: ""creamy.""",3,7/17/2011,Carmelina's
90,"Everything was above expectations here. The garlic shrimp was the best I've ever had, my server was punctual, polite, knew the menu, and most of all she was not invasive. It is easy to tell that everyone who works here is a professional. The tagliatelle was perfect. I really don't know how else to describe it. Nice, small, bustling restaurant in a prime location with a decent beer selection and amazing wine. The meatballs are excellent as well, the chef can simply do no wrong.",5,7/20/2011,Carmelina's
91,"I absolutely have to write an update for my original review for Damiano. After my first experience, which involved some very rude service, I was invited back by the owner, Damien, for a complimentary dinner with my 3 other guests! It was one of the more busy/chaotic nights in the North End due to the Fisherman's Feast, but the owner fit us in for an 8pm reservation at what I think is the best seat in the house, right by the windows (which are open during the summer weather). The owner went out of his way to make sure that my party had an incredible dining experience, and boy was it incredible! The hostess was very sweet when I arrived and said who I was, and our server, John, treated us like royalty the whole evening. The owner, who was also cooking on this night, prepared some of the most delicious food I have had while dining out, and we did not leave hungry! I lost count at some point, but I think our server brought us 7 or 8 ""piattini"", plus individual servings of the Chilean Sea Bass. Beyond the food, our party also drank 2 bottles of wine and Aqua Panna water, all on the house. My memory of my original experience at this restaurant completely faded away by the time I even sat down at my table to begin the night. The food: What is not to love? We enjoyed everything we tried, and we tried several of the menu items. Some of my favorites were the Baby Eggplant, the Wild Mushroom Risotto (not overly cheesy and heavy like some other restaurants make it), and the Chilean Sea Bass, which I think was a special. I kept looking at my family I was dining with and they kept saying ""Mmmmm"", so I knew everyone was in food-heaven! This is one of the more unique restaurants in this area....not the same old chicken parmigiana and spaghetti bolognese that you see on almost every other menu in the North End. If you have not been, don't let the ""small plates"" steer you away, they make for a much more enjoyable evening because you have the opportunity to try several foods.Thank you to Damien for making it up to us! We will surely be back.....soon ;)",5,8/21/2011,Carmelina's
92,"Atmosphere is ok, however the service was not so good, on top of everything, all the food was brought at the same time, Caprese salad was good, spaghetti and meatballs  were ok, cost was above average$$$.",2,8/22/2011,Carmelina's
93,"DELICIOUS!  Not crap stereotypical North End drivel like chicken parm and the like, but honest to goodness food put together by somebody wanting to give you a quality product.Crostini:  nice chilled san marzano tomatoes with olives and pecorino.  Refreshing and quite tasty.Had two risotto's, one with spicy calamari (I think?) and the wild mushroom.  Both were creamy and perfectly cooked with great flavors.Meatballs:  Damn solid...with the right amount of cheese to keep them interesting.We also had an order of shrimp scampi.  Nicely done.  Not a dish I'd usually order, but you have to be nice to your visitors right?Wine list is quite decent with wines nicely sorted by price point.  A tasty super-tuscan for only 30!?No deserts are served, but its the north end.  You have quite a few options.",4,9/3/2011,Carmelina's
94,"I've lived in the North End for a little less than 3 weeks and I've been there at least 5 times already (I feel a little silly saying this with a million great options around, but here's why):1. Damiano is one of VERY few places in the neighborhood that serve food at 3 PM. I'm not sure why but lately it's been the one time window I have open to eat, and there aren't a whole lot of places you can get a bite. Luckily, Damiano serves their brunch menu straight through to dinner, including decent belinis and wines. 2. So far, I haven't been disappointed by the food. I've been here for Resto Week a while back, which wasn't THE most impressive. But since I've been back, I'll swear by the mushroom risotto (the pea & pancetta risotto isn't bad either). The gorgonzola penne is extremely rich and clearly made from scratch which is great, and tasty. The meatballs are also seasoned well and the perfect size portion to have alongside any pasta. 3. I always get a prime window seat. However, I do feel obliged to point out that somehow, for whatever reason, I always get the most quiet server in the place. I've noted several times that every other server is more talkative and friendly... maybe I scare him by attempting conversation? Not sure :) It's not UNfriendly, just not exactly warm & fuzzy like I'm used to at Bricco or Euno. Damiano gets a 4 star for consistence and reliability, and tasty food pretty much anytime of the day. I know I'll be back often.",3,9/18/2011,Carmelina's
95,"the food is still great, although I miss some items they use to have, but that happens, restaurants change their menus, anyway...the downgrade, the atmosphere.  it was uncomfortably hot.  next, the waiter is kind of forgetful, it took 10 min to greet us, and another 10 to get water.  we finally get our wine and water when this man comes in and starts yelling at our waiter and uses the f bomb, it turns out, it was the owner...classy",3,10/6/2011,Carmelina's
96,"Great food, good service, nice atmosphere.  Love the tapas style 4 course dinner.  Food cooked with love and to perfection.The only negative is that the door opens right on to the dining room and when its cold out (like last night) a blast of air sweeps across the patrons and their meals making things a bit uncomfortable.  Maybe put up a partition or curtain on the cold nights?!We'll be back.",4,10/9/2011,Carmelina's
97,"A Columbus Day weekend meet-up with our daughter, who is in her first year of college in Boston, brought us to the North End for Sunday lunch. It was a rare, summer-like day and all the restaurants had their doors and windows open to the street. As we strolled down Hanover Street, passing by Ristorante Damiano, I noticed a front-row table in the small but crowded restaurant had just been vacated, and luckily, there were no parties waiting. My instincts told me to stop right there and I said ""This is where we are eating."" Within a minute the waitress had bussed our table and we were seated  overlooking the street. The waitress politely informed us that we had to order from the Sunday brunch menu, which offered a limited selection including frittatas, salads, panini sandwiches, pasta, risotto, entrees -- plenty of choices to satisfy our varying tastes and appetites. My daughter and her friend ordered chicken and cheese panini sandwiches -- large, crunchy concoctions served with generously-portioned mesclun salads. The girls did not leave a morsel on their plates. My husband ordered the spicy Fra Diavolo Calamari with risotto, which he devoured with enthusiasm commenting about it being creamy and perfectly spiced. I ordered the beet salad with greens, goat cheese and pine nuts and the fried calamari appetizer. The salad was composed of mandoline-thin beet slices in a light vinaigrette under a bed of field greens with small bits of goat cheese and a sprinkling of pine nuts. This healthy salad was very light and tasty, but not filling-enough to stand alone as a meal. I was glad to have ordered the appetizer of delectable fried calamari, which was very light, melt-in-your mouth perfection enhanced by a spicy blend of capers and tiny bits of red bell peppers. We limited our drinks on this hot day to bottles of refreshing San Pellegrino sparkling water with lemon slices. The meal for 4 totalled about $80. It was a very relaxing experience punctuated by the warm breeze and people strolling the side walk by our table. As we were finishing the meal, we had no idea that we were about to be entertained by the city of Boston's Columbus Day Parade and we had front row seats! This was a complete  surprise and it added a fun dimension to our lunch that we had not planned. When we finished our meal, we were not rushed to pay and vacate the table. All diners were allowed to linger and watch the parade from their tables without feeling pressured to leave. That attitude alone deserves five stars.",5,10/14/2011,Carmelina's

102,"My last two visits to the North End have been here -- and they've both been excellent. During our most recent visit, we had a group of ten early on a Saturday, and in addition to welcoming such a large group with no attitude whatsoever, the service and quality were great. Keep in mind, this is a smaller place (they can seat about 25) with an equally small kitchen, so for a large group, one or two misses would be excused. However, this was a perfect and memorable evening. From immediate seating to timely service and friendly staff, the experience exceeded all expectations.The food -- well, I'd be comfortable having several other popular North End spots take some direction from the kitchen staff here. With ten people at the table came ten different entrees and a host of appetizers, and an opportunity to share, and I have no complaints. Here are a few highlights:- Their Carbonara is a special treat (if you appreciate good Carbonara, this may be the only place to do it right).- The meatballs are plain good. Packed with flavor, and served with a sauce that you'll agree was made fresh no more than a few hours earlier.- The bread? From a bakery around the corner that's been there for decades. We ate it all.- Crazy Alfredo - The name, meh. The taste, however -- instead of being the traditional overly creamy and sometimes bland sauce, it's a spicy mix of meats, roasted red peppers, and lighter on the Alfredo sauce. The small portion is just the right size.Note that they don't serve coffee or dessert, but with several options a street crossing away, you'll do just fine.",5,1/30/2012,Carmelina's

104,"I was walking around NE during the weekend, and dropped in at Carmelina's by accident. It was a sunny day, and we were lucky enough to get a table by the windows (that open completely). The restaurant itself is a mixture of trendy and casual, there are small white linen cloths on the table but nothing that makes it too uptight and I feel there's a relaxed atmosphere in there. For those that want to, it is possible to dine at the bar and watch the chef prepare the meal.Our waitress was not very pleasant, and I just didn't feel very welcome - not exactly what I want at a italian restaurant. The food was alright, I ordered a spicy tomato sauce pasta which tasted good although I think the pasta easily could have had a minute less in the boiling water. My friend ordered mushroom risotto, and that definately was overcooked.I haven't been around the NE too much, but I'm sure there is better italian to have out there than Carmelina's.",3,3/20/2012,Carmelina's

111,"We're from San Francisco so we look for really good Italian food and wow, did Carmelina's deliver.  Upbeat, stylish decor, friendly staff, just a nice ambiance.  We had the lobster ravioli and crazy alfredo, and both were excellent.  The salads were delicious with a nice balsamic vinaigrette dressing and not a scrap was left on our plates.  The staff were attentive and helpful.  Loved this place!  Be aware they do not serve dessert but after my yummy hand-made pasta there was no room anyway.  We took home some tiramisu from a nearby pastry shop.",4,5/30/2012,Carmelina's
112,"Carmelina's is pretty much what you'd expect to get in the North End.  Starters fared much better than mains.  Calamari, meatballs, risotto, fried mozzarella were all much better than the disappointing stuffed pork chop that was overdone and the rollati di pasta.  In most cases you come to the North End for the scene not the food, and Carmelina's is no different.",2,5/31/2012,Carmelina's
113,"Everything we ordered from the calamari to the pasta had capers in them, the pasta was greasy and even clumped together and when we let the waitress know she actually used a fork to poke at it as if we were lying! Finally, the service was inattentive and the urinal in the single bathroom was clogged! Gross.",2,6/18/2012,Carmelina's
114,This place sells Italian tapas basically.  Very tasty but expensive,4,6/27/2012,Carmelina's

116,"Had a very enjoyable dinner at Carmelina's on a recent trip to Boston.It was a lovely summer evening in the North End, Boston's Little Italy, and all the floor to ceiling windows were open facing the street.There was a good energy in the room and they had cool music playing, not corny Italian stuff.Took advantage of the specials and shared the seared scallop appetizer and then had the 16 oz. veal chop which were excellent.Prices are reasonable ($30 for a decent bottle of Italian red wine) and service is friendly.Interestlngly, they do not offer dessert but rather encourage you to visit one of the many pastry cafes on the block for coffee, dessert and after dinner drinks.",5,7/16/2012,Carmelina's
117,"Great food and service. I sat at the bar, overlooking the excellent preparation of meals. What a sight to see!  I came for seafood, had the bay scallops pasta special, and left quite satisfied. This seafood pasta dish was more than enough for my main dinner, and had a nice seasoning kick to it.  My waiter was polite and engaging, he recommended an excellent (and moderate) wine choice. Everyone from the head chef to the wait staff to the host was wonderful.",5,7/20/2012,Carmelina's
118,"On my first real day/night outing in Boston, my cousin and her man took me to Carmelina's. While walking in the rain to this place, you can almost miss it if you're not careful. The place is small but very cute. They open the windows and you're pretty much sitting on the sidewalk. The menu is pretty tasty looking, and priced accordingly. It has a casual feel with the fancy fine dining food. My self I ordered the Bay scallop Risotto. Never had risotto until that day and I liked it! The scallops were cooked to perfection and very tasty. Also on the table were a beet salad and salmon tartare. Both we mouth watering good. My cousin's husband took the liberty in ordering the wine, and well I must admit, some of the best tasting wine I've every hand! This please is a must eat in my book.",5,7/28/2012,Carmelina's
119,"Carmelina's in the North End is conveniently located across from Mike's Pastry.  That's one reason they don't offer coffee and dessert.  The intimate room is nicely appointed, with some tables along the street, where the glass wall slides open.  The menu offers many traditional Italian specialties, supplemented by daily specials. We opted to try two of the specials - both of which were excellent - once we got them both.Our server was indifferent, to say the least.  He finally refilled our water spontaneously only after having to be prompted the first time.  Ditto for our bottle of wine. At one point, he was leaning on the empty chair at our high top and it felt like he was intruding on our meal. The bread was a little dry and they were pretty stingy with the balsamic and olive oil.  Our waiter initially brought me the wrong entree; apparently he hadn't bothered to review the night's specials.  When I got the right meal, it was very good - and more than I could eat despite really trying and getting help. The final negative comment concerns the bill - which still included the wrong - and significantly more expensive item.  Had I not been paying attention, I would have been overcharged.  Thus, the tip reflected the poor service we received - and I almost regret leaving even less.  On the other hand the rest of the staff were very nice and the food was really good, so we'll go back some day.  But we'll make sure we don't get the same server.",3,7/28/2012,Carmelina's
120,"AMAZING! Best clams ever; delicious crazy Alfredo; beautiful stuffed pasta with prosciutto, spinach and fontina; divine lobster ravioli; scrumptious penne gorgonzola. And the attentive, knowledgable staff is a bonus! Wish I could give them six stars....",5,8/28/2012,Carmelina's
121,"Absolutely delicious and just the right portion which is hard to find in the North End (delicious yes, but always sooooo much).",5,9/5/2012,Carmelina's
122,"You will leave this place absolutely glowing... Sadly, this afterglow will be attributed to no A/C and no airflow.  Perhaps Bostonians are accustomed to a lack of A/C, but if you are traveling from the South, you are in for a rude awakening, which can really take away from the dining experience.  When dining at Carmelina's, be sure to request a seat near the front of the restaurant, as it is an open air concept, and that air does NOT reach the back of the restaurant.With regard to the food, I will concur with the another poster that the apps stole the show.  We had the baby eggplant, which was very lightly battered and fried.  It was delish!  I wish I had ordered two as my meal.  For the entrees, we has the Crazy Alfredo and a seafood special with shrimp and lobster.  The CA was good, but too spicy a dish for the extreme heat in the restaurant.  The couple beside us (or should I say at our table, as the tables are VERY close together) seemed to feel the same way, as they also had the CA.  The seafood dish was a bit lighter, but the seafood was cooked a little past where it should have been.  They also could not refill our water glasses fast enough.  A carafe would have been nice.Overall, not bad, but not amazing.  Might be a totally different experience on a cooler evening.",3,9/9/2012,Carmelina's
123,"Incredible!!!  Open kitchen fascinated me....watching them sear, flambe and create was astounding.  The food was frankly out of this world.  **You MUST try the Lobster Ravioli Macchiavelli made from rock shrimp, scallops and crab in a saffron, tomato, cream sauce with porcini mushrooms. It is insanely delicious.  My husband swooned over his ""Crazy Alfredo"" which was a lusciously prepared chicken, sausage, sweet roasted red peppers concoction tossed in a spicy Alfredo sauce.  We started with the Calamari Piccante - spicy goodness in every bite.  I wish I could have tried even more on the menu. I'll be back!  This should be listed as a must when in Boston.  @@I loved that most of the crowds were up the way at Giacomo's Ristorante, it allowed us to slip in here without a reservation on a gorgeous Saturday night! Woohoo.",5,9/16/2012,Carmelina's
124,"If you're a tourist, hungry, walking down Hannover St., late on the weekend, and without a reservation... this is a decent pick. Our favorite dishes here were the appetizers. The satisfying meatball appetizer and amazing lamb lollipops had us asking for more. The spicy sausage chicken pasta was just ok, and the chicken carbonara was lacking in flavor.-update: I got a snappy message from the restaurant because the weren't happy with my review. Now that's a first!",3,9/22/2012,Carmelina's

126,"Breakdown of my cousin's birthday dinner at Carmelina's:Appetizers:Wild Mushroom Risotto...OMG, so amazing!!! I could eat so much of that... We ordered two for the table and I considered getting more as my meal hahaBaby Eggplant.. basically eggplant parm, also deliciousMeatballs were really good. I usually don't like a lot of places red sauce, theirs was good.Entrees: Three of us got the Sea Bass ""pistachio"" style. I thought the portion was a  little small for the $25 price tag. Also, I had to put salt on it, it was a little less flavorful than I was expecting.Two got the Crazy Alfredo. Pretty good, a little spicy from the sausage ( I think it was sausage..maybe chorizo, I forget). The server was great, suggested a great red wine that I loooveeeed. (ask for the one almost like a Sangria) Overall, I thought Carmelina's to be a little pricey and small (but so is everything in the neighborhood). Some things were amazing, others were ehhhh. I'd try it again though for sure.",3,10/15/2012,Carmelina's

128,"Myself and 3 others went to Carmelina's for dinner on a Thursday night. While small, the restaurant has a welcoming atmosphere with an open kitchen in the back. The calamari and lamb pop appetizers were very good. The wine and beer selection was excellent. Everyone's meal was delicious, and our server Paul P was awesome. The four of us had a fantastic time, and will definitely be back soon. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an authentic, delicious Italian meal in the north end!",5,11/19/2012,Carmelina's
129,Pretty good if you're going after the harpoon happy hour haha. The service was arguably good. The server came around often and happily fixed his mistake with our order. He was also pretty attentative to us.. through my drunken haze.. and filled up water when I needed it.Got the Sunday macaroni and was way more meat than I anticiipated. Who doesn't like a meaty surprise?! I expected some kind of mac n cheese but nope. This is macaroni noodle on a bowl of meat. Yum!,4,11/19/2012,Carmelina's

131,"This place gets high marks for their food but much lower marks for service. Food: We started with the baby eggplant, which I highly recommend. Perfection on a plate! I had the four mushroom rigatoni for my entree. That was one of the best dishes I've eaten in a long time. The smoked mozzarella and Silicilian bread crumbs are bit unusual but pair well with the juicy, flavorful mushrooms. Service: We showed up a little before our reservation to see if they could seat us early. They told us to come back in 15 minutes for our reservation, but when we did, we still have to wait another 20 minutes or so. (And this place is tiny so there's really no good place to wait). Once seated, the waiter was nice enough but he didn't bring bread until *after* our entrees had arrived (probably 10 minutes after the appetizer since they seemed to be encouraging quick turnover). It would have been nice to have the bread along with the eggplant appetizer. Even though the place was clearing out by the the time we'd finished, we still felt like we were being rushed out.",3,2/25/2013,Carmelina's
132,"My girlfriends and I like to venture out to the North End to treat ourselves to a girl's night out every couple of weeks. We stumbled upon Carmelina's because our regular place was booked, and we fell in love. Fast.I had the Rolatti di Pasta and I'm telling you, I dream about it! It's such an incredible dish with crispy pasta rolls filled with cheese and prosciutto and goodness I am salivating just writing about it. It's perfectly savory. The wine list is also very impressive, and the waiters are very good at helping you select the perfect wine for your pairing. I personally prefer white wine with pasta, and the pinot grigio with lime hints is amazing! When my boyfriend came up to visit I took him and he too was floored. He ordered a seafood pasta dish (they don't serve his usual go-to, chicken parmesan) and he was a very happy camper.Also, start with the eggplant appetizer. It's the best eggplant I've ever had! And best of all (yes, it gets even better!) this place is right across from Mike's Pastry! So save room!Bravo Carmelina's! I have absolutely nothing negative to say!",5,3/14/2013,Carmelina's
133,"I was disappointed when Damien decided to close Damiano, as it was one of my fav. North End spots, but Carmelinas was top notch. We started with the mussels and calamari, and the broth for the mussels was perfect, although I think the portion could have been larger. The calamari was cooked well, and had a nice light batter. For my entree, I had the pistachio chilean sea bass, which was phenomenally cooked. The potatoes and spinach that accompanied it were also prepared really well. My boyfriend had the Sunday pasta (which he has had many times before) and loved it. Our friends loved their gnocchi and crazy alfredo. Only downside is that they only serve beer and wine, no liquor. However, the wine menu is very impressive.",5,3/18/2013,Carmelina's
134,"This place was solid. My friend and I sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen and watched them make the Sunday Macaroni that we both ordered. I think this is one of the biggest bowls of food I've had in a long time-meatballs, sausage and shortrib with a little bit of pasta and some ricotta on top-loved this dish.I ate it for about the next three days too...Service was quick/nice even though the place was pretty busy. Overall-great place",4,3/29/2013,Carmelina's
135,"Came here on a Sunday evening in April and loved everything! Our waiter Nick was great - attentive, knowledgable, and even brought us an extra side of crispy potatoes since he overheard us trying to figure out how they prepared them (delicious!!!!). Ask for him!I had the Rollati di Pasta and it was AMAZING. I've probably been to 7 or 8 restaurants in the North End since moving here in August and this was hands down the best meal I've had.Highly recommended!",5,4/7/2013,Carmelina's
136,"The food here was outstanding! I had the butternut squash ravioli and I think it was the best pasta dish I've ever had. We also had to fried mozzarella and garlic shrimp for apps- both great. Two guests in our party got the risotto which was very good. One person got the Sunday macaroni which was HUGE and very tasty- LOTS of meat in this thing.I loved the vibe here as well. It's a small place, but the tables aren't crammed together like a lot of the restaurants in the North End are. The floor to ceiling windows were open as well, and the place was the perfect temperature even though it was a bit chilly outside.We made a reservation beforehand and I was surprised to see that when we walked in (a few minutes late) they had a table all set up and ready to go for us. Only complaint would be the service. Though our waiter was knowledgeable and helpful, he really was not attentive. And there were only 2 other tables he was serving so I don't know why this happened. He also cleared all of our plates without asking if we wanted to take home leftover (which we did) which I thought was odd.Overall, a great spot! Come here for the food, not the service.",4,4/26/2013,Carmelina's
137,"Like every self respecting child of an Italian mother, I have high standards for Italian food. This place definitely passes the test. My parents accompanied my boyfriend and me to Carmelina's on one of our regular outings to the North End. My dad asked the waitress to help him decide between two bottles of chianti, and she kindly offered to bring a small glass of each so he could decide for himself. For appetizers we enjoyed the wonderful mussels marinara and the simple arugula salad, which was the perfect combo of lemony, peppery, and salty; along with bread and olive oil. Each of us were impressed with our entrees - the pork chop was delicious, the Crazy Alfredo spicy and flavorful, and the puttanesca was exciting on top of homemade spaghetti. Like many authentic North End places, Carmelina's doesn't serve coffee or dessert, but that gave us the perfect excuse to head across the street to Cafe Vittoria. This place is definitely a new favorite! We will be back.",5,4/28/2013,Carmelina's
138,"The food was great.  I took my family who was in town for Mother's Day and everyone was happy with what they ordered.  We started with the Eggplant appetizer, which was the best!  I had the Rotali di Pasta and thought it was delicious.  I would definitely go back!  They had an awesome wine list and overall I thought the prices were decent for what you were getting.  Just wish they had a dessert menu because we would have stayed there for more!",4,5/14/2013,Carmelina's

I would definitely go here again.",4,5/27/2013,Carmelina's
141,"Rarely do I write a review about a restaurant, but Carmelina's was outstanding.  The fact that our waiter was attractive didn't hurt, but he was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu, suggesting certain dishes and discouraging dishes he felt were not ""house specialties"".  One of the dishes came out later than the other three and I'm fairly certain everyone working in the restaurant came over to apologize.Our table of four started with the caprese salad (very fresh mozzarella!) and the ahi tuna arrabbiata.  The tuna is noteworthy primarily because it's prepared in a way I've never before experienced with a delicious olive tapenade and sweet and spicy peppers.  I had the swordfish tips with angel hair pasta which was a little spicy and absolutely delicious.  Friends got the tonno con pesto siciliano (delicious!), the pesce al forno (catch of the day was sea bass which was perfectly cooked), and the baked mushroom rigatoni.  Great wine selection as well.  We went with a Graham Beck Chenin Blanc given how hot it was outside.  Would definitely return for another meal",5,6/3/2013,Carmelina's
142,"One of the best meals I have ever had in the North End!  Like most restaurants in the area, it is small but boy is it good.  We strolled by on a busy Saturday evening and they were happy to seat us.  The caprese salad was delicious with chunky slices of fresh mozzarella and basil.  The rolls were crusty and served warm with olive oil. Yum!  My entree was outstanding, roasted swordfish with chunks of tomato, olives, capers  and carmelized onion.  The fish was moist, tasty and just delicious.  Serving size was generous and I enjoyed every bite.  Our waiter was attentive and happy to answer all our questions about the menu.  The mimmos Sangria was refreshing and I highly recommend it.  You will not be disappointed.",5,6/9/2013,Carmelina's
143,"Carmelina's was the only lunch spot on Hanover that didn't have a wait at 1pm.  The atmosphere and location is A+ but the food was awful.  The risotto had an inch of water in the bottom of the bowl (I took pictures).  I kept thinking of Kitchen Nightmares and what Chef Ramsey would have done, he would have been furious!  The frozen risotto that comes packaged at Trader Joe's is better.  In fairness, the cauliflower appetizer was fantastic.",2,6/10/2013,Carmelina's

145,"My friends and I were there tonight for the first time on recommendation of others. We were hungry and we had reservations. We arrived and our table was waiting. The hostess was friendly and showed us to a street side table, open to all that the North End has to offer on a warm (thank goddess!) Friday night. We ordered a bottle of wine, that was overly warm, but delicious nonetheless, then two starters: baby eggplant and spicy shrimp. The eggplant was amazing! Perfectly prepared with parmesan cheese, somehow in that the cheese was a second skin to tender succulent eggplant, perfect amount of sauce and bits of fresh basil. YUM! The spicy shrimp is served with capers and a wee bed of angel hair pasta in a tomato sauce that is almost creamy with just the right amount of bite. YUM! My friends ordered Penne Gorgonzola  and Garganelli Spada (thick fettucini with swordfish) and I ordered Pesce Pistachio (which was sea bass being the fish of the day). O M G! we were diving into our own dishes as well as each others! It was a magnificent feast and we were delighted with our choices, which, I might add, were spurred on by our lovely server/hostess/busser. She was amazing and kept talking about how much she liked the dishes here and what a pleasure it was to serve and be a part of food she believed in. I wish I'd gotten her name! Local girl who is definitely going places. Compliments to the chef and the entire staff @ Carmelina's! We will be back!",4,6/14/2013,Carmelina's

147,"Wow! We visited Boston over the weekend and based on other Yelp reviews - went to Carmelina's for dinner. I am sure there are many other incredible restaurants in this area, but Carmelina's was right up there! We made a reservation for Sunday 6pm using OpenTable - walked to Carmelina's from our hotel - and were seated right away (the restaurant was completely filled by 7, 7:30 with walk-in's and reservations). They provide you with bread and an oil/balsamic mix (absolutely delicious!). The waitress was very friendly and promptly took our order, explaining that the kitchen is very small so things may come out at different times. We ordered the calamari, the caprese salad, and an arugula salad with oranges etc. All were well made and very tasty. For our main course we had the ""Crazy Alfredo"" and the Spaghetti Puttanesca. These were easily some of the best pasta dishes we've ever had. The sauces had great flavors, pasta was perfectly cooked, and the portions were perfect (large portions, but finishable!) They do not have dessert, but there are many pastry/coffee shops in the area. The drink selection was nice - we had a Delirium (beer), Pino Grigio, and their Sangria. It is a small restaurant, but I did not feel uncomfortably close to any other table - even when it was at full capacity. When we arrived there was some nice ""old school"" music playing - once more patrons showed up they changed the music to be a little more trendy (I really don't know what to call it - I preferred the original music, but the music in general wasn't loud or invasive). The front of Carmelina's is completely open to the street, and as tourists we enjoyed people watching and taking in our surroundings. The street noise was not a problem and overall we had a truly remarkable dinner. Thank you, Carmelina's - we wish you were closer! Great customer service and delicious food!",4,7/3/2013,Carmelina's

150,"Heard lots of good things about the Italian food in the North End, and since my friend and I needed a break from the Freedom Trail, we opted to stop here with another friend (whose a Bostonian). We waited for about fifteen minutes since the place is kind of small but we were fortunate enough to score the center table at the window. Yay for good weather and people watching! Right before we went in, an old lady came by and whispered that they charge and arm and a leg which I thought was weird but whatever.The three of us all wanted gnocchi, which was the special of the day and for some reason the waitress kept trying to convince us to mix it up which was sort of annoying. We opted to get an appetizer to appease which actually ended up being really, really good. It was a crusted cheese served with marinara (and olives?) which we ate with the bread. The gnocchi was also pretty good, albeit not amazing and the service was definitely on the slower side. With so much Italian competition around, they definitely need to step up their game. Overall good meal though and conveniently located near Mike's!",3,9/5/2013,Carmelina's

152,"Let me start by saying: the food my entire party got was delicious. However, the service we received (and the rudeness following our expressing our concern to the manager) was deplorable and ensured we would never be returning. From the very beginning, our table was inexplicably ignored. It took them quite a while to even take our food order or fill our waters. Don't even get me started on the bread - we didn't receive it until well into our entrees. We asked about it about five times and each time received a curt reply that the bread was in the oven - despite the fact that all the tables around us received bread before us and when we did get our bread, it was cold and not piping hot like it just came from an oven. My friends meal came out about ten-fifteen minutes after ours and while I understand things cook differently, that length of time is ridiculous - particularly when she ordered the same thing as someone else at the table! Finally, after they plopped down our dishes without saying a word, no one ever came around to see how our food was or if we needed anything, and we had to flag the waitress for the check. The coup de grace was finding out they can only split the check on two cards - which apparently isn't even true, as by that point we engaged in a conversation with the manager about our dissatisfaction and he told us that we were lying and could split the check on my cards. I was, most of all, SHOCKED by how they treated our concerns. They preemptively took the late dish off the check, which was nice, but when we expressed our concerns about everything else they were rude and dismissive, stating that it was busy. I understand that, but if you cannot handle that amount of clientele, don't seat that amount. It seemed like everyone else around us was treated much more attentively than we were so I am not sure what their problem with us was (maybe that we are locals and won't take their crap?). But I was so shocked when, after the manager listened to our concerns, we could see him and his staff LOUDLY complaining about us and then he just threw the check back to us without another word. I didn't want a gift certificate or something, but at least a polite, ""I'm so sorry for your experience and I hope we can see you soon"" would be polite human behavior. As someone who has worked in service and just paid for an expensive meal, I was very upset with the treatment. Considering there are about fifteen thousand other options, please take your business somewhere where you will be treated with common human decency.",1,9/22/2013,Carmelina's

154,"As a huge fan of just about any place in Boston's North End, I have to say I was disappointed. Tried two appetizers and moved on to another place. The calamari was tough and just not very good. If you can't do a good calamari in the North End then you are in trouble. There was an appetizer that sounded very creative on the menu, ricotta meatballs. Don't get it. It is just a big ball of cheese even if they describe it as a ""meatless meatball.""  It might be good over pasta. I did like the open kitchen and the place had great potential. The atmosphere was cool and our waitress was great.  With 200 great Italian joints within 4 blocks you gotta get me right out of the gate. We moved on.

This place around 6:30pm was empty and the store front was all open so we decided to try it. We had side salads and Risotto meatballs which were good. Then we had spicy Alfredo which was delicious and my roommate had a risotto dish with seafood which was amazing. While we were there the place got packed.

The server was extremely helpful and suggested we started off with one of his favorite dishes, the Ahi tuna arrabiatta. It was OUTSTANDING! Perfect combination of spice and fresh ahi. The server suggested a bottle of wine called Mona and it paired with our entree's exquisitely. My wife had the risotto frutti di mare, and I had the crazy alfredo. Both were absolutely fantastic. Great place, great atmosphere, fantastic service. We will be back!!",5,12/21/2013,Carmelina's
160,Wow. This restaurant  fell apart when there computer system was having problems. There were many open tables but me and others wouldn't be seated until the computer was functioning again. I was utterly disappointed in the restaurant that had good rating for the most part. Me and other members of my party left the restaurant at 8:15 when our reservation was for 7:30 looking for another restaurant. After we finished enjoying our meal from another restaurant and walked past on our way back to our hotel there were customers that had reservations before us were still waiting. In my opinion the restaurant completely failed last night at serving and satisfying their customers. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,1,12/29/2013,Carmelina's
161,Went to Carmelina's for a late dinner and the food was fantastic. They were awesome about accommodating my dairy free diet and if you sit at the bar you can watch them cook! I had gone here when it was Damiano's and had loved it and was extremely pleased to see the same quality and service at Carmelina's,5,1/23/2014,Carmelina's
162,"Stopped by last night (Saturday) at around 8pm and after just a few minutes wait got seated at the bar which overlooks the kitchen (my favorite kind of seat as I like to watch the cooking). Restaurant was busy so I think we were extremely lucky to get seated without a reservation. Service was pretty good. They started us off with a complimentary panzonella salad that was very tasty.  Wine list was fairly short but had a good variety and prices were reasonable so we ordered a bottle. Glassware could have been higher quality but I guess that's part of why the can keep the wine prices lower. First course of arugula salad was very nice. Simple with just some parm cheese chunks and lemony vinaigrette. Pork belly appetizer was excellent and large enough to be a full course for some. But of course we had ordered main courses as well so we soldiered on. Crazy Alfredo is well named as it is a spicy cream sauce served on a bed of fettuccine with chicken, sausage, red peppers and more. Sunday macaroni was amazing. A bowl of nicely sauced short rigatoni with a large ultra tender and tasty pork rib, delicious grilled sausage and 4 amazingly tender and flavorful meatballs. Did I mention the meatballs were the size of large eggs. Really large eggs. They were really good. The whole dish was coated in a generous sprinkling of parm cheese and to top it all off a big dollop of ricotta cheese. And not like grocery store bland ricotta cheese this stuff was a cut above that. We ate and enjoyed what we could but there was just so much food we couldn't finish it all - they graciously packed up the extra for us in to go boxes so we get to enjoy this meal again. Maybe more than once more. There is that much food. Watching the chefs cook was fun and even educational. They are using what appeared to be all good fresh ingredients and most dishes are made on the spot (Sunday macaroni being an exception since that needs to simmer a long time so they clearly had made that ahead of time and reheat as needed which is fine by me). They are generous with cheeses, cream, olive oil and all the things that make Italian food great. When dinner was over we were given a complimentary after dinner drink of a chocolate liquor who's name escapes me but which was delicious and a nice way to end the meal. So why only 4 stars since I clearly like the place and liked the food. One word. Bread. I believe Italian food needs/deserves good bread. We had to ask for bread and what we got I can only describe as overcooked brown and serve rolls out of a package.  And just one each (not that more of these would have been an improvement) That came with a minuscule dish of olive oil and balsamic which was easily absorbed by the dried out bread on first dip. Seriously?  Not quite sure why they would skimp on something like bread but there you have it. I'll be back that's for sure (this actually was our second visit. I recall liking the first time just not the details). I just won't be going there for the bread. I'll be going for the meatballs, pasta and pork belly. And hopefully some more leftovers to enjoy again.",4,2/9/2014,Carmelina's
163,Unbelievable. I made a 9:15 reservation. I showed up and was treated like I was garbage. I was very confused and asked if we were going to be seated soon.  A man acted as if he was the manager and didn't seem to care that I was going to take my business elsewhere. Overall horrible experience! He said he doesn't use or respect Yelp.,1,3/15/2014,Carmelina's
164,"I've never had a yelp account, but after eating at this fine italian restaurant I knew that it was important to get my experience out there. I was greeted by a really nice guy who I believe was the manager, and was immediately given a nice table. I stumbled into this place without any recommendations or knowledge of the food quality...wow am I glad I did!!! The waiter told me to try the tuna arrabiata. It was fresh Ahi Tuna w/ jalapeno peppers and an olive tapinade. It was, and I don't say this lightly, one of the best appetizers I have ever had. I've yet to experience fish this fresh anywhere else in the city. It was simply incredible. I wasn't sure what to get for a main course, so I asked the waiter for a recommendation. He asked me if I was in the mood for pasta, and I told him ""when in rome!""...We shared a laugh and he directed me to the ""Crazy Alfredo"" This is a great dish with sausage, roasted red peppers, and chicken. It was so savory and delicious....I can see what all the hype is about!I was given a complimentary after dinner drink because I think it was very evident how happy I was with my meal and experience. The service was speedy and awesome, and my food came out quickly, but not in a rushed manner! I will be back. When my son visits Boston, this is going to be our first stop!",5,3/19/2014,Carmelina's
165,"Amongst the restaurants in the North End Carmelina's is particularly special. It is like a hidden gem located across from mikes pastry. The ambiance is calming and it is private enough that you don't feel rushed. You can have a conversation here without feeling like the people sitting next to you are listening. The menu is tailored by the team with specials that change regularly. The salads are beautiful and the meatballs taste like they are from Italy. This is the perfect place to take friends, family or a significant other.",5,3/22/2014,Carmelina's
166,"Wow. Blown away by my experience here. The service was fantastic. Really enjoyed the starter soup. The filet was cooked to perfection....my friend had the fish and he said he had never had a better fish. The colorful vegetables were to die for. The kitchen staff were handsome, clean, presentable & professional.  I highly suggest the fried calamari.",5,3/30/2014,Carmelina's
167,"Finding a table for 4 in the North End at dinner hour is a challenge, but not impossible. And we were lucky enough to hit this little gem at the perfect time. The service was excellent from start to finish and I liked the fact that our server had opinions. He suggested we try the meatballs and they were a home run. Everyone loved it, and the fact that four meatballs come in a serving it was perfect and not too much.The food is made to order, they use fresh ingredients and each dish is prepared with North End pride. They have carbonara (""made the real way""), which I presume means they don't use cream. And usually I always order it when I see it, but I passed and went with the puttanesca which had a nice spicy kick. But if I ever get back, I'm making sue that carbonara gets in my belly.The dining room is quiet and made for a nice evening out and relax. We passed on dessert and headed to Mike's, but only because it has become our Boston tradition.",4,4/6/2014,Carmelina's
168,"3 hours for dinner?  Worth it!  (driving, not waiting!)OK, let me start with my love affair of Crazy Alfredo at Carmelina's in Hadley MA.  Incredible dish.  Many similar recipes have sprung up, but none compare to that original dish many years ago....  Then they closed in Hadley!!!  What to do?  Drive to Boston and get my fix!  I love this part of town, how can't you if you enjoy italian food???  Carmelina's fits right in.  Modestly sized (with some of the wall hangings from the Hadley location!), updates to the menu (required for the Boston location), it was a great meal.Crazy Alfredo:  Great as always.  Tasted a little different, but still enjoyed it immesly.Carbonara:  Wife really enjoyed this dish.  Not the traditional ""dry"" (which I prefer), but very good.Service:  Friendly host and waitress.  No complaints.Location:  Can't get much closer to Mike's pastry, so again, great location and right on the main drag.Highly recommend.  Will be back many many times.  I truly hope they are successful in Boston.",5,4/8/2014,Carmelina's
169,"Yum! Carmelina's is so delicious. We tried this restaurant a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it. Despite being on Hanover it doesn't feel overly touristy, which as a local is great!  I had the Penne Capricciose- it was so good that I ordered it for take out a week later. :-) Definitely worth a visit.",5,4/10/2014,Carmelina's
170,Overall amazing restaurant! The service was friendly and inviting and the food was phenomenal I loved the lobster ravioli! I would highly recommend to any one looking for authentic Italian cuisine ! I can't wait to go back again when I'm in the area,5,4/13/2014,Carmelina's
171,This is the best Italian meal I have ever had!   I can't say enough. . We started with the baby eggplant and I would have been happy with just that. .. But then the entrees!   My whole family had pasta dishes.  All were made with homemade pasta.   Our favorite was the crazy Alfredo.   The fusilli pasta with tuna was delicious.  The service was prompt and friendly.   I would recommend this restaurant highly.,5,4/22/2014,Carmelina's
172,Great place to eat in the north end. My go to for when I'm craving traditional Italian fare. They have some unique twists on some stuff but the pasta is so fresh and good. Great place to bring a date for some red wine and great italian food. Two Thumbs up.,5,4/30/2014,Carmelina's
173,"The wait was over 40 minutes after our reservation time and while the hostess was very sweet, she didn't manage our expectations well. She'd given us a number of different tables and quotes as to when we'd be sat. We stood in the tiny entrance for a while and eventually I had to go outside and stand in the rain. I took to Twitter and surprisingly, they answered. Nick came outside, introduced himself and made sure we got sat. He was kind enough to comp us an appetizer and made sure we had a great time. It was my 25th birthday dinner so I really appreciate them going above and beyond to ensure a good experience. Food and wine was amazing. Thanks to Nick and we'll be back.",4,5/12/2014,Carmelina's
174,"The food here is awesome! Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious. The service on the other hand, was not good at all. We had a 7:00 reservation for 6 people. We arrived about 5 minutes early, and the hostess gave our table away to some random people off the street with no reservation! We had to wait for another table for 45 minutes before being seated! When the food was served, a member of our party was told there was a mix up in the kitchen and that her food would not be out for awhile. She had to sit there and watch everyone else eat, and was not offered anything in the mean time!  I understand mistakes happen sometimes, however, the waitress was unapologetic and did not handle the situation well at all. The food is good, but because of the overall dinning experience, I would have a hard time recommending to a friend.",2,5/12/2014,Carmelina's
175,"This place has the best Carbonara in Boston, hands down. Great atmosphere and good service as well.",5,5/13/2014,Carmelina's
176,Delicious..we had the 4 cheese and mushroom rigatoni and the carbonara. Would definitely make this a regular stop. Best carbonara I ever had.,5,5/14/2014,Carmelina's
177,"Had a group of 10 for dinner here - and we all left very happy.  I can only speak about the meatballs and mushroom risotto - but both were very good.  In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say the meatballs were fantastic.  We had a pretty picky and diverse group and everyone seemed pleased.  Good wine list, nice bread, good service...  I would definitely come back.",4,5/23/2014,Carmelina's
178,"Before I visit a new city I engage in serious culinary recon. Where are the best places to eat? That's what I wanna know. Forget historical and cultural points of interest. It's all about the food.I was spending a day and a night in Boston with some friends. A friend of a friend recommended some Italian place in Boston's North End, which is basically nothing but Italian restaurants. Well, we never made it to our intended destination as we were sidelined by Carmelina's. I dunno, there was something about the menu posted outside that drew us in. That,  and the inviting atmosphere; modern, but rustic, with forgiving, ambient lighting.The wine selection is limited and I believe all Italian, as far as vintages go. I had a fantastic Chianti. We shared the Simple Arugula salad, the Winter Blood Orange and Beet salad and a house salad. All excellent. The arugula salad was drenched in extra virgin olive oil and lemon, yet not a bit over done. And that blend of blood orange and beets? Oh, my.For the main course, I ordered the carbonara. Never-- in my life-- and this is not an exaggeration-- have I ever had pasta this outrageously good. It was as perfect as  pasta can get and let me tell you, you get a lot. The portions are incredibly generous. One of my friends ordered the ""Sunday Macaroni"". After a couple of bites she said, ""This is better than the pasta I had in Italy."" So, of course I had to have a bite of this ""Sunday Macaroni"" which is laden with meatballs, sausage and short ribs in a tomato sauce. Oh. My. God. Seriously. The food at Carmelina's is that good. I'm still fantasizing about that carbonara. I'm not kidding. Aside from the food, the service at Carmelina's is spot on, friendly, and utterly non-pretentious. It should be noted that Carmelina's does not serve dessert or coffee. This, we learned, is out of respect for the pastry and gelato shops and cafes in the area. In fact, as we were being seated, the guy at the adjoining table shifted his bag away from our table to the other side of himself. My friend reassured him he didn't have to do that, and in his very Boston accent he replied, cheekily, ""Oh, yes I did. I don't trust you. I can see it in your eyes."" Turns out that bag contained pastries from Mike's Pastries across the street. (They're very serious about their pastries around here. We'd noticed Mike's as were wending our way through the neighborhood. It was packed.) Our server informed us Mike's would soon be closing for the night, so one of my friends ran off in the middle of our salad course to score some cannoli and Boston cream pie.I kid you not, if ever I visit Boston again, Carmelina's will be my first stop.",5,5/26/2014,Carmelina's
179,I brought a group of 11 to Carmelinas for my girlfriends birthday and everyone had a great time and loved their food. I strongly recommend this restaurant and think it is a great spot to celebrate with a group as well.,5,6/1/2014,Carmelina's
180,AMAZING food. By far the best meal I've had since I've lived in Boston. My boyfriend and I went there for our anniversary and both of us were extremely impressed with the food. I want to give a 5 but the service was poor. Still worth going for the food though!,4,6/1/2014,Carmelina's
181,".It was our last night in Boston and on a suggestion from a server in another restaurant, we went to Carmelina's. Great location. They had the front windows/wall open to the street and we were seated near the street. A little noisy but such a beautiful night out, it was nice to feel like we were sitting outside. The service was good despite the fact that they were out of most of their winelist. No chianti available.we both ordered off the specials. My filet was a little tough but the potatoes were good. The bf had the swordfish and said it was ok. Nothing to rave about. All in all the food was ok. Service made up for it.",4,6/2/2014,Carmelina's
182,"Phenomenal food, great atmosphere. We went for lunch, perfect portions, and wonderful Italian food!",5,6/6/2014,Carmelina's
183,"We were originally going to another restaurant down the street, but that place did not work out so we ventured over to Carmelina's.  The hostess was very very sweet and informed us the wait was likely 30-40 minutes, which we expected since we didn't make reservations and it was a SAturday night.The menu and ambience looked awesome, so we decided to wait.The wait ended up being much longer, but the hostess remained pleasant and kept apologizing.  Once we were actually seated, the service was really great! They knew we had been waiting a long while, so they were extremely prompt in getting us drinks and taking our orders.I ended up ordering a shrimp appetizer for dinner and the portion size was large! I was very impressed with the quality and serving size of the entrees and the appetizers. All 6 of us ordered different dishes and each one was amazing! My friend got a mushroom risotto dish and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I literally could not stop eating her food! The semi-outdoor seating is nice and great for people watching. The food and service were impeccable.   I highly recommend this restaurant, especially during the summer months.",5,6/12/2014,Carmelina's
184,"Came back here again for my birthday and I'm still in love with this place. So fresh and delicious. The sea bass was perfect and the caprese risotto is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Also, our service this time around was impeccable-thanks, Jeff!",5,6/16/2014,Carmelina's
185,"An amazing little restaurant right in the heart of the north end. After a full day traveling we didn't really want to wait long to be seated. Happened upon Carmelinas and I'd say we got lucky. We were seated right away and the service was right on point. Pleasant young ladies assisted with getting us water and wine while we looked over the menu. We ordered the calamari appetizer which was mixed with spicy peppers, be careful, they bite! My wife ordered Crazy Alfredo which was the perfect blend of spiced sausage and chicken tossed in a rich and creamy Alfredo sauce. I ordered the Rollati di Pasta which was stuffed shells in a red sauce. Both were off the chart amazing! No leftovers here, just the right amount. Would definitely repeat and definitely recommend them!",4,6/18/2014,Carmelina's
186,"This restaurant is one of the smaller ones in the North End, but overall is a great, trendy spot to grab appetizers and drinks. The staff is attentive. Had the pistachio and blood orange Sea Bass, which was good, but the rabe was a bit overcooked and chewy. My girl friend ordered the seafood risotto which I thought was too tomato-ey/soupy and perhaps not cooked long enough. However, the garlic shrimp and ahi tuna appetizer was delicious and paired well with the wine selection they had on the menu.",4,6/21/2014,Carmelina's
187,"Stopped into Carmelina's because we found  a spot out front, saw the open windows and thought we would give it a try. By farther best Marsala I have ever had. My wife is Itailan and very picky when it comes to Italian food, but her gnocchi were exceptional. She said the sauce was just like her Nona's. So we are heading back into the North End this weekend.",4,7/1/2014,Carmelina's
188,"4.5 stars to be exact. Our last meal I'm Boston hit the spot. This place is amazing. We had an early dinner of Gorgonzola penne pasta and the baked stuffed pasta. Amazing. They don't do desserts, which is fine by me. They have a few dessert places to walk to, or roll out to if you can get out of your chair. They actually suggest you go get gelato or hit up Mikes. Walk around and find Paul Revere on a horse.",4,7/2/2014,Carmelina's
189,"We had a truly memorable meal here. The staff were super friendly and helpful, the food was uniformly fantastic: we loved the baby eggplant, the mushroom risotto, the super alfredo pasta and the puttanesca (among others).",5,7/6/2014,Carmelina's
190,Amazing pasta! Definitely recommend! You will not be disappointed. Only knock I have is the bread could be better but otherwise amazing!,5,7/12/2014,Carmelina's
191,"Fantastic food, I wanted classic spaghetti & meatballs that were not on the menu, they said of course....soooooo good, meatballs melted in your mouth. Hub had the shrimp, mussels & clams over capellini pasta, he loved it!The high lite of our nite was the hostess Felicia, she was so accommodating & will come back just because of her making our experience wonderful.",5,7/13/2014,Carmelina's
192,"Given the past reviews on this place I was expecting excellent food and a nice slow meal.  Instead the three courses came out too quickly for us to finish one before the next got cold.  The pasta, if it was homemade - was not very good.  The chicken was dry and overcooked.  Only the mushroom risotto and meatballs were ok.  Its really noisy, which can be fun if that is what you want.  I personally felt a bit claustrophobic. To make matters worse I started feeling very sick half way through my meal and both me and my boyfriend were sick the next day.. I can't say definitively that it was the food there, but I think it might have been. Ultimately it is just a tourist restaurant, which I wish I had realized earlier.",2,7/14/2014,Carmelina's
193,"Food was excellent but tainted by the rude waitress who 50 min in to our $70 lunch announced that they had a reservation for our table and asked, without apologizing, if we could ""wrap it up.""  Dear manager: word travels fast and you shouldn't seat people if you are going to end the experience of your customers by asking them to ""wrap it up.""  Won't be back and won't recommend it.  The food wasn't worth that.",2,7/18/2014,Carmelina's
194,"I hate to give this place the 5 star review only because the more good reviews it gets, the harder it will be for me to get in here, LOL. But I gotta do it. This place is fantastic!!  One of the best if not the best place in the North End right now.  Don't just walk by, go in, you will not be disappointed. The small, open, two person kitchen runs like a machine and the wait staff is fast, friendly and efficient.",5,7/21/2014,Carmelina's

196,"This is the best place in the north end!!! I come here with my family every Sunday and it is great. Thy have the BEST meatballs I have ever had. I have been to Italy a few times and they are better then the ones I have had here. You get 4 huge meatballs for 9.00 dollars. You cannot beat that. We also get the ahi tuna salad. The tuna is amazing and so fresh. The Sunday macaroni is a MUST try. It's huge. It comes with 3 meatballs, a sausage and a short rib. It's amazing and huge. 2 people can definetly share it. The linguini and clams is also great here. I always get the seabass with the pistachio crust. It is delicious and very flavorful. They are also vey accommodating here and the service is great. If you get a chance to try it here, make a reservation because it is always busy. I love how they have big doors that open up so it feels like you are sitting outside. Love love love it here.",5,8/6/2014,Carmelina's
197,"We had a 5 star evening with fantastic food and service.  We selected the sea bass, the halibut, and the fruit of the sea with risotto     Great ambience. Jeff was attentive and knowledgable about the selections and wine. Thanks so much. It's not that often you can say wow that was amazing!! We'll be back..",5,8/16/2014,Carmelina's
198,"Was amazed they could accommodate a group of 10 as an almost last minute reservation.  The spot is typical North End in that it's cozy and loud conversation.  That aside, we were not disappointed!  The meatballs were absolutely fantastic and flavorful, as was the carbonara!  In fact, everything we got was tasty - the ahi tuna, penne, fruitti de mare, etc..  We never got to the entrees as the portion size of the appetizers were ample and filling. The service was fast and with a smile.  My only complaint is that it was TOO fast so the first round of things we got were not hot throughout.  That in itself was disappointing as it tells me it's not fresh-made, but made ahead and heated.  It didn't harm the flavor but I was really expecting FRESH/home-made meal.We would go again though!",4,8/28/2014,Carmelina's
199,"Got a table with no problem after Labor Day week. Small, quaint place with upscale Italian flare. Service was good. Bread was boring, no dipping sauce though, had to ask for olive oil and parm to make our own. The meals were enormous so no need for bread anyways. I had the frutti marre and my boyfriend had the Sunday macaroni wish was amazing!!! I would order that and share!!  Needed a bit of salt for my taste but otherwise delicious!",3,9/4/2014,Carmelina's
200,Really great seafood! The torched salmon crudo and fois gras were great! Amazing service and the food came out FAST.Very excited to have this restaurant in the neighborhood.,5,6/3/2016,Saltie Girl
201,Ate at Saltie Girl for the first time last night and had an amazing meal. The restaurant space is really cool and the food was great. Had one of their highly touted tins - the tuna belly. Freaking amazing. Also had the lobster roll and calamari which were two of the best of those items i've ever had. Great service and the food came out fast. Can't wait to go back!!,5,6/9/2016,Saltie Girl
202,"Had lunch here today. Staff, Bobbie and Rusty, were great. Atmosphere was fun. Food - fantastic! I had Ipswich clams - so fresh and flavorful, light. My companion had the smoked salmon plate served on a wooden block- beautifully presented. Salmon was just perfect. Even the post-meal towelettes were novel/unique! We will be back.",5,6/10/2016,Saltie Girl
203,"Everything was great until it wasn't.  Cocktails were delicious , raw bar amazing , decor was inviting, hospitality SUCKED. After spending $200 in less than 2 hours, you wouldn't expect the manager to come to the table and ask you to get up so they can seat a new table as soon as you finish your drink. I get it , it is a new restaurant, you want to turn tables, but before you asked my friends and I to leave we planned on becoming regulars and now we plan on never returning. There are dozens of places to get oysters and cocktails after work in Boston, so if you are going to be rude to the customers, please don't think they will be coming back.",2,6/10/2016,Saltie Girl
204,"Solid place if you're looking to have a seafood-centric meal, and I would definitely go back because I think we could have ordered better. Notes on dishes:- tuna carpaccio: delicious. Tuna was tender and well-prepared, good bite with the little mushrooms! Came with perhaps 5 strips, decent size although can't recall price.- pickled beet salad: generally good, as good as others I've had. Nice break from the seafood.- three clam vongole: the clam sauce was flavorful and not heavy, the noodles very chewy, but nothing to write home about.- torchon of foie gras: loved the pairing with the quince, and again it was generally good.- cockles: we wanted to try this because their thing is tinned seafood, but I would not recommend being adventurous and starting with something you've never heard of. I just don't see the point of eating cockles except for texture, but then again I'm not the most adventurous seafood consumer.- hot French bread: amazing and definitely worth paying for. I think between this and the toasts and the tinned dishes, I ate way too much bread, but this was an oh-so-good culprit.We ordered this between 5 girls and came away decently full (maybe due to immense bread consumption) and it wasn't expensive. We felt like the Bob Marley music and shack vibe (with the neon lights and booths) gave off a more casual feel than the food, but I liked that it felt cozy and our server was super nice, although it was about a week in and she still hadn't tried some items on their (extensive) menu so couldn't provide comprehensive recommendations. Compared to other restaurants on Newbury though, this is definitely a star!",4,6/12/2016,Saltie Girl
205,"My wife and I tried Saltie Girl for the first time on Sunday afternoon. The raw bar was very good, with some unique additions such as snow crab cocktail. Also cherry stone clams are sometimes difficult to find, and they have them here!  Moving on to the ""tins"".... WOW, what a pleasant surprise. We tried the octopus in garlic oil, the sardine toast, and foie gras. All were insanely delicious. The experience was unique - picture charcuterie for seafood!!!  The food prep was thoughtful and the taste combinations were spot on. The jams, pastes, salts, small peppers, herbs, etc that accompanied the seafood paired very well. The bubbles and wine selection was more than sufficient (although a rosé champagne by the glass would be a great addition).  The cocktail menu was fun and the cocktails all had a great presentation, especially the pineapple!  The caviar selection is very good as the chef used to work at Caviar Russe and knows his stuff. The ambience was welcoming and lots of fun. I can't wait to return!!",5,6/14/2016,Saltie Girl
206,"My buddy and i stopped in for a quick lunch at the bar today. Everything was perfect - the ousters and shrimp were fresh and delicious, tuna carpaccio was superb, and the fried whole belly clams are a must!One word of warning. Tables seat a maximum of 4 people so if you have a big group you may want to try and take over the bar.",5,6/17/2016,Saltie Girl
207,"A west-coast style seafood restaurant has finally made it to Boston! We came here for brunch and split several dishes. The lobster and waffles is amazing; I can't go back to the chicken version. Although the waffles are a must, it was actually the snow crab toast (with burrata and avocado) that was the surprise best dish. Otherwise, the tuna poke was delicious and the torched salmon belly was good (I especially liked the apple) though a little too sweet. Overall, a pleasant but pricey place that's great for a slightly upscale meal.",5,6/18/2016,Saltie Girl
208,"Great ambiance but service leaves something to be desired. Ordered one thing was served another (pleasantly surprised how good the snow crab toasts were despite my hoping for garlic clams). French fries were the star of the show. Being from New England, I hold oysters to high standards, I expect cold and shell free if they are going for over $3, neither of which came to fruition. Between other oyster bars I the area, not sure this place caught me hook, line, and sinker.",3,6/24/2016,Saltie Girl
209,"Great location, lovely aesthetic details. Had a mojito made with Barbancourt rum (impossible to find outside Haiti), and it was smooth and refreshing on this hot day, and had just the right amount of sugar. I can't speak to the food, but it looks delicious.",5,6/30/2016,Saltie Girl
210,"Such a wonderful experience! Everyone was beyond helpful, friendly, warm, and inviting. Can't speak highly enough of the staff (Kyle, Rusty, Cory and Michael). They went above and beyond to ensure our expectations were met with wine, oysters, and all food. Go here, you will not be sorry!!",5,7/1/2016,Saltie Girl
211,"Saltie Girl....Salty attitudes....I agree with Laura M. , a fellow reviewer. I was eager to try Saltie Girl and it was my birthday.  I had 6 people in my dinner party.  As soon as you walk in, you are not greeted with a smile but with a group of men staring you down as if you are robbing their house. tough nuts to crack...maybe they dont like female customers.  The clincher. ... We were told that we could not be served dinner...not even breaking our party up, 3 at a table.  I had people meeting me there...what an embarassment.  This place is pricey too.....dont waste your emotions or your money on people who are unfit for the hopitality industry.",1,7/2/2016,Saltie Girl
212,"We stopped in just to sit at the bar and have a drink for a hot minute. They were cool with it, though they were making seafood dishes that filled the place with that delicious fresh seafood scent. If we hadn't literally just come from dinner, we would have happily devoured something. The space is small but clean and cute, with decor that fits the seafood theme perfectly. I didn't experience enough to leave a full review, so here is a short haiku:Green walls, sherry, fishMermaid nipples overheadThumping beats bring joy",4,7/3/2016,Saltie Girl
213,Rusty and the staff are amazing and the food is incredible...  The drinks are excellent,5,7/3/2016,Saltie Girl
214,"Loved the food here, however the service was disappointing..Food: large variety of seafood, clam chowder was amazing and warm lobster roll was loaded; limited selection of beer, pistachio cocktail was amazing- not too sweetService: my cousin tried to bring her baby and stroller inside and we were greeted with a dirty look- did not feel very welcome.. The space was narrow, but there was only one other party eating at the time (3 pm) and the staff did not really try to accommodate us.. This was disappointingAmbience: I definitely liked the vibe here.. Aqua colors, beachy theme... Did not like the booths- very high to get in to.. Not sure if they can seat a party of more than 4 peopleBottom line: great food, would've liked to try more had the service been better",3,7/3/2016,Saltie Girl
215,"Good food, good drinks, fun staff, beautiful little bar and restaurant!  Menu is interesting in the best way. What else is there to say?",5,7/4/2016,Saltie Girl
216,"This is a wonderful, thoughtful restaurant. Graceful service, food that is prepared as it is ordered, with skill and confidence. The oyster selection changes daily. No pretension. Is it pricey? Yes, a little, but I don't feel overcharged given what we've received. Everything is 100% fresh, clean, and precise. Such a delight. If there was a TV show about my life, this would be where I would eat.",5,7/5/2016,Saltie Girl
217,"GREAT COCKTAILS & SEAFOODSaltie Girl is a boutique, intimate seafood restaurant in Back Bay perfect for a date or drinks & apps with your girlfriends! The maximum party size is 4 people, and they do not take reservations. The best time to come would be at 5:00 PM on a weekday - it was completely empty when I walked in! I loved the bar seating, as it was very bright and their bar set-up is beautiful. You can also watch the staff freshly shuck oysters for guests.I would definitely recommend the PINEAPPLE COCKTAIL ($20) which comes in a rose gold brass pineapple mug, perfect for sharing between two people or drinking alone if you're super thirsty. The drink is a refreshing cocktail for the summer that is little sparkly from the citrus soda and not too sweet! I am not the biggest fan of seafood, so I opted for the SALTIE GIRL BURGER: A fat juicy beef patty, fried lobster, thick pork belly, and avocado. It was monstrous! The patty was cooked perfectly medium, and the pork belly was a great contrast of texture and saltiness. The fried lobster was a little tough to bite through, but that was all the seafood I needed. Their home made french fries were also perfectly seasoned and crispy! I loved this entree. We also got the TORCHED SALMON BELLY, which had very thick cuts of salmon sitting on a bed of avocado pieces, which was surprisingly filling. It was the perfect appetizer, but came out around the same time as our burger. The staff was extremely attentive, and because the restaurant is so small, they make sure that their guests are taken care of. I will definitely be back soon!",4,7/5/2016,Saltie Girl
218,"My fiancé and I were in town for a week from Seattle. We are spoiled with seafood in Seattle, so we weren't expecting to find one of our new favorite restaurants. For all the eating out we did in Boston that week, this was the only restaurant we returned to. The chef puts unique spins on the dishes and we tried to mix it up. The hot lobster roll was the best I've ever had. The fried oysters were served on a slaw that set them off amazingly. My fiancé had the burger topped with fried lobster/ side of pork belly on avocado. He said it was one of the best he's eaten. He's a burger snob, so he's hard to impress. We had escargot, tinned cockles (they're known for their tinned fish). OH! and the crab cocktail in truffle aioli is KILLER. I can't explain what others have said regarding the service. Furthest thing from our experience. They remembered us even though we'd been there only once 5 days earlier. They were helpful with all our questions, and spot on in friendliness. They are only 5 weeks old, so if they are this great now, it is only a matter of time before everyone knows about Saltie Girl. This place is going to do well. Wish they were in Seattle!",5,7/5/2016,Saltie Girl
219,Great food and friendly staff.  Really small in here so get here early and put your name in.  You can go sit at the Met Bar while you wait for your seats to open up.  I can't wait to try more stuff on the menu!  The snow crab toast is absolutely to die for.,5,7/7/2016,Saltie Girl
220,"Great, Warm Friendly Service, every setting has a attention to detail, food is one of my favorites this year 2016! Keep up the good work! A must try!",5,7/8/2016,Saltie Girl
221,"All these new restaurant openings are really raising the bar this summer. We may have found a new favorite seafood place in Saltie Girl. Between Saltie Girl and Select, the Back Bay is now certainly spoiled in terms of raw bar / seafood type restaurants.Saltie Girl is fairly small (about the same size and setup as Neptune without being quite as cramped) and they do not take reservations. We went by around 7 last night. They took my # and quoted 20 minutes for a table. They called 2 minutes later and had 2 seats that had opened at the bar. The space is nicely done. Their floor to ceiling west-facing bay window in front really let in a lot of beautiful light to the space.The menu features seafood prepared any way you like it (smoked, shucked, fried, preserved, crudos, ceviche, raw, etc.). Having been in Spain last month, we really appreciated their anchovy and sardine selections. People were raving about the fried lobster and waffles. I'm sure this is the dish you will be reading about in reviews, but I prefer seafood simply prepared. We tried:- Crab Toast: This was a large dish, plenty to share. The combination of crab and burrata was delicious.- Sea Urchin: Simply prepared with sea salt and a dash of EVOO. Delicious. The chef said they will try to always have uni on the menu and will get in live urchin when possible.- Anchovies: As I mentioned above they have a fantastic selection of tinned fish. We tried some anchovies and they were served beautifully still in the tin on a slate platter with 3 sea salts (black, smoked, flake), pickled vegetables, bread, sea salt butter and jam). Overall a delicious platter of accompaniments. I look forward to trying more selections from the tinned menu.- Tuna Carpaccio: This was one of the highlight dishes, pickled hon-shimeji mushrooms, and house ponzu. The tuna was expertly cut and complimented well by the other flavors. I'll get this one again.- Scallop Ceviche: I'm not a huge ceviche fan. I find the citrus used to cure the fish often overwhelms the flavor of the seafood, and this was no different. My wife loved this though. I would have prepared the beautiful raw scallop to be sliced and served simply with some of the fantastic flake salt they use.- Lobster Cocktail: Well, it was lobster cocktail. Nicely cooked and delicious as lobster is. Based on this I'd try the lobster roll if I was in the mood for that.We would have loved to try more, but were stuffed after consuming the above. Some of the dishes we saw being prepared that will be in the lost to try next time include the pickled beet salad and steak tartare toast. The oysters looked to be expertly shucked as well.The wine list looked good, with lots of light offerings by the glass to compliment the fish; and the cocktails we saw coming out to our bar neighbors looked to be nicely made. We enjoyed their sake selection very much.While the food was firing on all cylinders after just a month being open, there were a few service hiccups. Our server was extremely friendly and informative, if she didn't know the answer to a question she asked the chef directly. It's just that she could have used another hand behind the bar. We ordered one tuna crudo, but the chef presented us with two. When I told him we only had ordered one, he didn't question and looked at the bar server as if this was not an uncommon occurrence. Similarly after two rounds of drinks, I ordered another for myself but not my wife. We were presented with 2. I didn't have the heart to send something else back so I drank both. Good thing I wasn't driving. Also, when they first took my number they offered that we could go next door to their sister restaurant for a cocktail. Ummm, I wouldn't advertise being affiliated with the Met Bar. Saltie Girl is in a different league.If you asked my wife her favorite restaurant over the past year, she would have said Select. We both agreed that based on the larger variety of seafood available, we clearly prefer Saltie Girl. We'll be back very soon. I wish they took reservations.",5,7/8/2016,Saltie Girl
222,Love their lobster roll! Its poached in butter. The lobster bites are a bit chunky so maybe slightly smaller pieces but it's delicious! Also really enjoyed their mussels and torched salmon belly. The beef tartare and fried clam belly were okay. Their signature drink for 2 comes in a beautiful pineapple tumbler.,5,7/11/2016,Saltie Girl
223,"The food is pretty good here.  The toasts were excellent, though very filling like a big sandwich, not an appetizer.  The canned fish was hit or miss.  For example, the canned eel, pushed by the waitress, was literally tasteless.   The torched salmon was like an cliche sushi roll without the rice.  The drinks were great.I think the biggest problem here is that the menu has about 200 items on it (no joke) and the servers were absolutely unhelpful in suggesting a way to create a balanced meal, or offering preferences. We did not order correctly as a result, and were disappointed.  They seemed very disorganized and unsure.  I might go back in  a few months but the restaurant at the moment feels stressful and the food, though unusual, not spectacular.",3,7/12/2016,Saltie Girl
224,"Everything about this place is instagram worthy from the decor to the menu to the food!Yes ANOTHER delicious seafood restaurant has opened up in Boston. Bummer, that the restaurant is really intimate (in other words very small). There is only 4 tables and a bar for seating. Literally less than 30 seats in the house - not a great place for a big party, but great for dates or a catch up with a friend. I came on a Wednesday night at 8:30pm and had a wait about ~15mins. They do not accept reservations. My friend and I started off with the pineapple cocktail for 2 ($21). It was nice light refreshing summer drink. I would easily call this the cutest cocktail I'm drinking this summer. It is light and refreshing. I literally ordered this for the brass pineapple cup it comes in. Yep, worth every penny. The straws are also the same metal material which threw me off a little but no biggie. We started off with the torchon of foie gras toast. The toast is a nice thick cut of texas toast and the foie gras is VERY rich. Yum. Next, we ordered the Torched Salmon Belly and this was my favorite thing I ate. It comes with thick cuts of avocado and chopped up cucumbers on top. Ok, I know I am at a seafood restaurant, so I was a little skeptical about getting the burger but no regrets. First off, the burger is $26 so yes pricey. But it includes fried lobster and two bacon shaped strips of pork belly - I mean can a burger get more irresistible? The beef patty was super juicy as well. At first glance, I thought this burger looked small (esp for $26), but what the burger lacks in circumference it makes up in height, trust me.  My friend ordered the fried lobster and waffles ($32), I'm not sure what type of sauce is with the waffle but it made it HEAVENLY. Literally everything was amazing and I can't wait to come back to try everything else.",5,7/14/2016,Saltie Girl
225,"Came in on a Friday for lunch, was not disappointed. Great cocktails, service (thanks, Rusty!), FRESH seafood and DELICIOUS lobster & waffles. Can't wait to return and try out the rest of the menu. Don't recommend this restaurant as a spot for large parties due to limited seating and lack of separate tables to push together, bar seating and booths. Excellent date spot but take that 4+ girls night somewhere else...like Lolita.",5,7/15/2016,Saltie Girl
226,"As I walked down Dartmouth street toward my apartment, I was pleasantly surprised to see a sign for ""Saltie Girl,"" and as soon as I read about it in Eater, my stomach started gurgling in anticipation of trying the menu. We came on a Thursday and there were only a few patrons at the bar, and none in the booths, however, a waiter advised us to sit at the bar until our party arrived and ""if there were any booths available, THEN we could take them."" Seems a bit silly, as the last member in our party arrived within 5 minutes and we quickly transferred to a booth (phew, thank goodness the place wasn't overwhelmed by swarms of hangry eaters in 2 minutes). The booths by the way, are a little odd to get into - there's only a short amount of space between the edge of the table and the seat of the booth. I had a bit of trouble getting into the booth, and I consider myself to be on the smaller side. Nobody needs to feel bad about their thighs when they sit down to eat (I know I shouldn't order those fries, dammit). Okay, enough about the atmosphere (okay, one more point - the bar is gorgeous, and the ambiance is lovely), and on to the food. Saltie girl has a really interesting menu. The place mats are paper, but the environment feels fancy - it's a great mix of New England and Back Bay. The cocktails are cool - they all have simple names and simple ingredients. I got the Agave, and it was perfect for summer, tasty and refreshing. We got the oysters (all of which I ate by myself) - and they were perfect. Finally, we got the Calamari, the Fried Lobster & Waffles, and the Saltie Girl Burger - all of which we shared, and all of which we DEMOLISHED. I could eat the Fried Lobster & Waffles every day. The fish and meat were lovely and tender, and really scrumptious. The Lobster & Waffles was a great blend of sweet and slightly savory. At the end of the meal, they serve you a little dish with a towel that you expand in water to cleanse your hands! It was a little like magic, which I enjoyed.Taking one star off because the staff was a little rude when we were getting seated, and then they were overly overly attentive. AND that damn booth. Otherwise, delicious!",4,7/16/2016,Saltie Girl
227,"Good seafood, but overpriced for poor service. As a seafood devotee (Seattle transplant), really wanted to love Saltie Girl - ambiance is outstanding as is the concept but cold service was such a turn off, can't justify paying top dollar. Dishes were abruptly thrown on the table as if we were a nuisance, rather unfortunate given we were celebrating my friend's birthday. For the price you pay here, typically servers would introduce dishes upon arrival especially with any noteworthy ingredients - good luck here. Recommend Island Creek and Row 34 if you're seeking excellent seafood, professional service and nice ambiance.",3,7/16/2016,Saltie Girl
228,"This place sucks - the food may LOOK good in the pics, but tastes awful, RUDE service, then an ugly bill.Stay away.",1,7/16/2016,Saltie Girl
229,"Boston needs more raw bars and seafood restaurants that break the mold of stodgy New England classics. We had oysters, uni, clam toast, and steak tartar (A+), but our favorite plate was the tin of cockles with toast: a first for us, they taste of the sea without being dense or overly salty. Like a tender clam without the belly. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and can't wait to come back. The house tequila cocktail with a bit of honeycomb was a fantastic accompaniment.",5,7/17/2016,Saltie Girl
230,"First this is a TINY restaurant. There are only a few tables and some seats at the bar, but this does not mean they don't have good food and decent service. The special dishes in this restaurant are can food. We ordered mackerel tin, tuna in olive oil tin and tuna in jalapeño olive oil tin. The tastes for these dishes are outstanding. They make can food not only can food. The tuna and mackerel are dipped into olive oil and other special ingredients, and three kind of salt are provided. I normally don't pay 20% tip, because not every restaurant service worths it, but the server we had definitely worth a high evaluation. He is humorous, kind and always keeps a positive attitude. This place is worthy to be patronized.",5,7/20/2016,Saltie Girl
231,"Tiny restaurant but cute.  We went for a later dinner ate at the bar area. We loved the hostess, shucker and server - such good service! the food was good too. we had oysters, mussels and the beet salad. Would go back again!",5,7/22/2016,Saltie Girl
232,Where to begin. My family and I loved this restaurant so much that we went two nights in a row. Michael is the friendliest waiter and made our saltie experience so amazing! Also his sea foam green Chuck Taylor's really fit the bill. We tried both the hot and cold lobster rolls- both are delicious. The tuna poke was so fresh and silky and the snow crab toast- amazing! We love Saltie Girl !,5,7/23/2016,Saltie Girl
233,"This place is going to get crazy when more people find out about it, so go now! It's tiny so I cozied up to the bar while we waited. Sea urchin and a coconut cocktail to tide me over? Yes please! We also split the beautiful pineapple drink. Our bartender took great care of us. Also appreciated the shared house tab, so I didn't have to stress about closing out to move to our table.We started our meal with the house special - summer tomatoes with a 50 yr aged balsamic, burrata, raw quinoa for texture and some delicious green sauces, and yes we added lobster. It was light and refreshing, we cleaned the plate. Gorgeous presentation!Then things got serious. Two of us ordered the saltie girl burger, which is out of this world - Gruyere, fried lobster, pork belly, AND avocado! They top it with an ""angry sauce"" which is something like Sriracha and mayo(?). The great piece is that they could have been lazy with the burger but it was actually very flavorful on its own - ground prime rib I believe?! Are you serious? The fries they served with it are also salty, crunchy, and I think they snuck some truffle in there. And you get your own mini bucket of ketchup, as the universe intended.My friend ordered the mussels - she loved them, I dunked my fries in the sauce and it was tasty with tons of garlic.But what really made our experience so lovely was our server Michael. He was so friendly and gave us great suggestions! We will be back!",5,7/30/2016,Saltie Girl
234,Beautiful place. The design is fresh and clean with a friendly staff that was incredibly supportive of each other. The chef's attention to detail was fascinating and our meal was simple and lovely. We will be back!,5,7/30/2016,Saltie Girl
235,"I was nervous about coming here for brunch because they don't take reservations, but my friend and I were seated immediately at the booth. It was 12pm on a Saturday (aka today).I selected a pistachio cocktail - a yummy blend of milk, chocolate, coconut, rum, lime and almond. Not a strong drink. You definitely get a hint of fruit with a chocolate aftertaste.My friend and I wanted to get everything. We shared:- tinted can of octopus w olive oil and garlic. This is reminiscent of a charcuterie board and comes with three different types of salt, butter, 4 large pieces of bread and jam. I would get this again or any other ones of their tint cans (eel, mussels, oysters, squid, scallops, etc)- beet salad w goat cheese, quinoa, hazelnut and buttermilk ranch. I am not much of a salad dressing person but the ranch is very minimal. You rarely taste it. Goat cheese comes in huge balls! - fried lobster and waffles w sweet corn butter and spicy maple syrup. This is a belly spurge since it's so rich. Very, very buttery. Could have done with less but overall, so satisfying. The lobster itself had a light heat to it- raw oysters. We only got 2 but it came with such an amazing display of sauces in this large bucket. Love the aesthetic Oh and the waiter who served us was super friendly and chatty. He clearly loved working at saltie girl!I can't wait for my next brunch date here!",5,7/30/2016,Saltie Girl
236,"Design is perfection...inspired by the Mediterranean Sea....great wine list...fantastic oysters.  Cocktails look legit, they chose to stock the bar with great brands. Mike Powers, our host, deserves 6 stars!",5,7/30/2016,Saltie Girl
237,"Very impressed.  We went on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and were seated immediately in a lovely booth.  The service was amazing. Our waiter, Michael Powers, was great!  Delicious wine, delicious oysters.  I can't wait to come back!",5,7/31/2016,Saltie Girl
238,"Fun place for brunch. Great drinks...think quality over quantity. I liked the coconut drink, but the pistachio one was not my cup of tea.Had the famous lobster and waffles dish, which was spot on. The waffle already comes with butter on it and includes a sweet-chili maple syrup on the side. Good to share, but you probably won't want to.I'm definitely coming back here with my girlfriends.",4,8/1/2016,Saltie Girl
239,"On a work trip from California and came alone. Small venue so sat at the bar. Service was amazing. Both the bartender and hostess incredibly kind and accommodating. Loved the variety of oysters. Recommend the tuna carpaccio and snow crab toast. Great music, fun atmosphere. A hidden gem off Newbury Street.",5,8/2/2016,Saltie Girl
240,"Amazing! The toasts are a definite must try! Stopped in for a drink and some apps and we didn't want to leave. Cheese plate was also a great snack and the french bread was perfection. No reservations, but worth the wait!!",5,8/6/2016,Saltie Girl
241,"Saltie girl was one of the best restaurants I've been to in awhile. The tuna belly in a tin we had was amazing and I can't believe I've never had fried lobster and waffles before because they were soooo good. We also had the torched salmon belly and tuna poke which I'd recommend as well. The only reason why they're not getting a full 5 stars is the size, it is tiny! It was an hour and a half wait on a Thursday night and I'd be worried about getting a table or seats at the bar again once everyone knows how good it is.",4,8/7/2016,Saltie Girl
242,"I know everyone always starts a review about the food but I will start with our amazing server Michael, he made the meal even better than it was (not sure how that's possible but he did - so thank you!)  My husband and I decided to head down to the open Newbury St event on Sunday August 7th and decided to try out the Saltie Girl for an early dinner.  The space is small, cute and has a very homey feeling.  We waited a bit but were fine just grabbing a cocktail while we waited.  I ordered off their cocktail menu and got the coconut and he the pistachio.  I prefer the coconut over the pistachio as if was refreshing and tasty but the pistachio was good too.We were sat about the same time they quoted us (30 min) and were able to sit at the bar and enjoy the views of the crudo making bar.  There are so many items on the menu that I really wanted but also wanted their amazing lobster roll that I've heard so much about.  We decided on the mussels to start which were prepared with garlic and olive oil.  Tasted a bit fishy but were good and plenty!  I ordered the warm lobster roll and he the burger.  At first we thought $26 for a burger, kind of pricey?!  But Michael saved the day and explained that the burger was made with ground prime rib and NOT ground beef, fried lobster and pork belly bacon HOLY MOLY!!!!  Thank you for recommending the burger for the Mister - he hasn't stopped talking about it!When the food came out I was so excited and ready to dig it and let me tell you, it did not disappoint.  You ask, why and how was it so good, it's just a lobster roll?!  I have no idea but it was the best warm, buttered lobster roll I have ever had and I've had some good local ones here in Boston and up the coast.  When the burger came I was kind of jealous because I do love a good burger so I let him enjoy it, I did steal a bite and you could definitely taste the difference between ground prime rib and ground beef.  Also, the French fries were awesome, seasoned with salt and pepper to perfection and just the perfect addition to an amazing burger.  We were both very happy with our first experience here and will definitely be back to try the tins and crudo.  Congrats to a great new addition to Boston, awesome staff and food!!!",5,8/8/2016,Saltie Girl
243,"I dined at Saltie Girl on Friday night and was overwhelmed by how excellent the experience was! I sat at the bar and was instantly greeted by Christiano with a smiling face willing and ready to help me choose a drink to start. I chose the coconut drink which was exceptionally delicious and refreshing on a hot night. I was skeptical about trying the tins, but he assured me that I would not be disappointed. With that, I chose the small sardines from Portugal which changed my perception of tinned seafood entirely. So yummy! The 3 kinds of salts were explained in depth and they were all perfectly paired with the sardines. The next course was the steak tartare. I watched it prepared in front of me by Chef Kyle, and it was like watching an artist at work. Hands down, best steak tartare I have ever had, and I consider myself a connoisseur. All in all, this was one of the best dining experiences I have had in the Back Bay area, or anywhere for that matter. Will definitely be bringing my girl friends here in the near future to share the Saltie Girl love.Thank you Christiano and the Saltie Girl staff!!",5,8/8/2016,Saltie Girl

245,"Yes it's tiny.  But arrive when they open at 11:30 on a Tuesday or other odd time, don't bring a huge group and you'll get seats.  This is a place for a meal with a friend, not a business meal or birthday party.  We enjoyed lunch - the torched salmon belly, snow crab toast and beef tartare were great (they have a few non seafood options if you don't want to OD on seafood).  We weren't crazy about the ceviche of the day but overall a good meal.  We weren't terribly adventurous - none of the tins or fried lobster stuff - until I started reading reviews after we had lunch I had no idea about the tins.  My advice would be to be sure to ask your server about the restaurant's unique offerings.Prices are on the high side which you'd expect for a foodie seafood place. (Yay!  I'm a fan.)",4,8/9/2016,Saltie Girl
246,"This is a really really great spot. The cocktails are excellent and the tuna carpaccio and torched salmon belly are some of the best raw fish dishes I've had. It would be 5 stars if the prices weren't comically expensive, even for Boston.Service is very good, the tinned seafood options come with great bread and accoutrements, and they have very interesting spirits, including for example an Argentinean gin called Los Apostoles.Would come here regularly if it weren't outrageously overpriced, as mentioned. I think if the prices came down even slightly, it would become much more appealing to potential ""regulars.""",4,8/11/2016,Saltie Girl

Everything has it's place and is beautifully appointed!And then...there's the food. It's just delicious! Best seafood I've ever had - and so beautifully presented. Try to go a little early or a little late - as the restaurant is already so popular and small that there will probably be a wait. We so enjoyed the salmon belly crudo - followed by the tuna poke and an heirloom tomato salad with burrata that was divine. What a great concept!",5,8/13/2016,Saltie Girl
248,"The vast majority of the food here is astoundingly good. Not a perfect 5 due to (1) sky high prices  (e.g., lobster roll can be more expensive than Neptune Oyster at 32-33) (2) no resv at all (3) some menu items were very meh.Interior, service, atmosphere are all great.+ oysters: obviously delicious. But even the east coast ones are 4-4.50!!+ the toasts are fantastic. Everyone gets the snow crab one; it's as good as it looks. Sweet, briny crabmeat on creamy but refreshing burrata and nutty creamy avocado plus crunchy, stretchy bread. YUM. Clam vongole is uber rich and salty, but in a good way. The portion might seem small for the price but it's chock full of clams, brimming with flavor and so rich that you probably can't  (shouldn't??) finish it all...all the tins & accoutrements are fantastic. Chowder was the best I've had in New England. NOT worth it: smoked fish was good, but you might want to save your belly space for all the other better stuff. Fried oysters are not worth it, the oysters did not stand up to the batter. The torched salmon belly was frankly bad - the salmon belly is already uber fatty and unctuous (ours did not get torched enough to get crispy), the sauce is oozing/ sweet and anything supposedly green/ refreshing was doused in it, the avocado is again fatty - it was really missing a foil in both texture and flavor.",4,8/16/2016,Saltie Girl

While they do not take reservations, I still am unclear as to why places insist on making it difficult to have dinner somewhere. Why not just take someone's Credit Card information; and if they cancel on you then just charge them for the cost of the meal.  That is what places USED to do that didn't want to lose out on $$$ if they did reservations.The good:+delicious food+friendly service+very good drinks (the pineapple thingy was good, although did make my tongue itch). +the food was GREAT; had the lobster role, the Sokeye fish special, the crab on the toast with avocado, and the warm bread, and the tomato salad. ALL were really great!The bad:-they forgot something on our order (the tuna)-- luckiily they didn't charge-no hard cider-no dessert offering-don't take reservations -teeny tiny restaurant Overall a great place and addition to Back Bay but terribly expensive (it was 80 dollars each for our meal) and too difficult to just drop in at.",4,8/17/2016,Saltie Girl
250,"Finally a seafood joint that lives up to the Boston standard. Their Tuna poke is fantastic - ordered it twice the two times I ate here (that's four orders). They also have a phenomenal dry ages steak for the non-seafoodie. Awesome, friendly staff. Great music and vibe. And mermaids everywhere. Plan ahead. Seating is limited but it's worth the wait.",5,8/18/2016,Saltie Girl
251,Went there with my girls for a quick lunch. EVERYTHING we ordered was super! And Michael (our server) was so kind. He took care of us very well. Saltie Girl is definitely my new favorite place.,5,8/18/2016,Saltie Girl
252,"This is a fine dining experience. The prices are steep but it is all worth it. My mom and I had a fabulous lunch here with great oysters, burrata, and burger with wine. I would definitely recommend this adorable little spot!",5,8/19/2016,Saltie Girl
253,"This place is TINY, and they don't take reservations. There's a bar counter, and then a few booths that fit around 4 people. So definitely not a place for a large group, but I only had to wait about 10 minutes because my friend and I got seats on an early Saturday evening. Plus, they're right on Newbury, so if you have to wait, there's plenty of shops nearby.We sat at the bar, and service was a bit slow. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful with menu questions, but I would have loved to not have to ask for water multiple times. The menu is HUGE. There's raw bar options, toasts, small plates, fried seafood, then a TON of tinned fish options. Personally, I usually go for more raw seafood which I wish I had done. However, I wanted to experiment and stray from the norm of my ordering habits so I got the pastrimi smoked salmon, some oysters, garlic clam toast, and sardines with olive oil and lemon.Seems like a small amount but I literally ordered so much, I didn't touch the smoked salmon and had them box it for me and I ate it for breakfast the next day.  So while the prices are high, it makes sense for the quality and the amount served. The sardines were tasty, and came with three different salts, bread, lemon, peppers, butter, a whole tray of fun. I was indifferent to the garlic clam toast, a little upset the menu didn't mention that it's covered in parmesan since I'm not the biggest fan of cheese. With the bacon jam is almost tasted like a clam pizza. The pastrimi salmon recommended by our waitress was super tasty and came with a mini toasted bagel, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers and capers that I pretty much made a salad the next morning. My friend got the atlantic lobster cocktail which she loved, and was given A LOT of lobster. She also order the snow crab toast with she liked the flavor but could have come with more crab.I think service can improve, but I would like to come back and try other options on the menu. Since we sat at the bar, some popular dishes that seemed to be hits were the heirloom tomato salad, tuna poke, and the torched salmon belly.",4,8/25/2016,Saltie Girl
254,Loved it!!!! I had waffle and lobster. It was delicious just wasn't enough for the price!!! It would take two orders to really fill you. Great for a snack!!!,3,8/30/2016,Saltie Girl
255,"This place and this team are amazing. Great location, beautifully appointed. The attentiveness and personalization is extraordinary. Fantastic cocktails, glorious food and the very best Bluefin Toro EVER!",5,9/1/2016,Saltie Girl
256,"My go to test for a new seafood restaurant is the lobster roll. It was adequate. Nothing special. The chips were interesting. Roll was toasted with far too much butter. Very small lobster roll for the price. Restaurant is a teeny, tiny spot which does not do much for the ambiance.Not a fan of restaurants that serve soda by the bottle. Didn't stick around to see if they charged for a refill. The staff was nice enough for a late Sunday afternoon. Glad I tried, but I won't be going back.",2,9/4/2016,Saltie Girl
257,"Stopped in during a one day Boston trip. Lunchtime, sat at the bar, had crab toast and clam chowder. Both were amazing. Not touristy, very crafted food.",5,9/6/2016,Saltie Girl
258,We decided to stop into this restaurant/bar for a light lunch. The decor is inviting and cozy. The waitress was very helpful and I had the butter lobster roll which was AMAZING!!!  The warm slightly sweet bread was delicious and the lobster was stuffed into it with just the perfect amount of butter. Every bite was heavenly. Needless to say I was not willing to share even one bite with my hubby! He had an ample bowl of clam chowder with fresh bread. He loved his as well. The entire staff is welcoming and friendly. I suggest you give them a try. We are only in town a few more days - but plan to return. The prime rib infused burger sounds like a great reason to revisit. #foodie,5,9/6/2016,Saltie Girl
259,"I was really excited to try Saltie Girl. I'm a total seafood fanatic and loved that their menu has so many interesting choices. Had a 45 minute wait but went to MET bar next door for a drink while we waited which was convenient.Ambiance is really nice, really cool bar, nice decor. Limited seating, not a great place for groups. Most of the seating is bar seating (backless bar stools, not the most comfortable) other seating is one line of booths that look like they might only fit 4 people comfortably.Food was very tasty:oysters - very fresh but served to us with lots of shell bits, not the best shucking job. Love the sauces and and accompaniments and how they're served in bottles with droppers.torched salmon belly crudo was amazing all around - melt in your mouthWaffle with Fried lobster - very tasty but i think it is definitely overpriced. For the amount it is (I believe 32 or 38 can't remember) I would have expected at least a tiny bit more lobster. The waffle was very good and the dish itself was delicious, lobster was well cooked. The spicy syrup wasn't really spicy mostly sweet but i still enjoyed it.Gnocchi with Caviar - delicious, gnocchi was perfect the caviar was such a nice complement and placed so nicely on each pieceGarlic Clams with Bacon Jam and Fresno chili toast - very flavorful, comes on a giant slab of nice bread (more a fork and knife dish than a pick up and eat with your hands dish) fingerling potato salad - A-Ok. good but nothing insane, poached egg was a nice touch thoughOrdered the pineapple cocktail for 2 and had some rose which were both really good.My biggest issue about the meal that night was probably service. Everyone was very nice but it seemed like the bartender was a bit frazzled and kept saying how busy they'd been and understaffed. There was some confusion with some of our orders. It felt as if we were being rushed out of there which wasn't ideal. When you spend that much on dinner you want to be able to feel like you're welcome to enjoy it. There were also some loud complaints coming from some of the staff about the tip about customers who seemed to stiff the staff with tip (well founded of course, but just don't think it should be shouted so that other patrons can hear it). I'd like to give it another shot because the food and drinks very good and really high quality, but definitely need to make sure I have no qualms with burning money there. Dinner for 2 with tip came to just under 200 dollars. Again loved the food but felt that the service and overall experience should have been better for the amount of money we spend (200 in just under an hour).",4,9/7/2016,Saltie Girl
260,"That pineapple cocktail doe. Damn.. Got me all head over heels and shizz. Hands down the best cocktail I've ever had! Shared with my girl but honestly I downed it after ten minutes. I couldn't get enough of their drinks so I ordered another watermelon cocktail. Again, delicious! Feeling a bit celebratory today so decided to hit up this spot with my fav person. Wasn't disappointed! Everything we ordered (except that tin octopus) were amazing! We really like the torched belly salmon and the crab toast. Oh and that razor clam. SUPER FRESH! The saltie girl burger was good but nothing to rave about. The best part of that burger was that fried lobster tail. Only bad thing is that this place is wicked small! And no reservations. :(",5,9/8/2016,Saltie Girl
261,Best dinner last night at Saltie Girl! Michael was such a fun waiter. We had the burger and the hot butter lobster roll.. Both amazing!,5,9/10/2016,Saltie Girl

263,"Excellent seafood at appropriate pricing.  We had a dozen oysters, the special clam from Japan, the heirloom salad and french baguette.  In addition, we had a great selection of French wines at good prices and pours.  In addition, the ambiance was very cute and lively.  I loved the decor and how clean, bright, and well-decorated the place was.  Highly recommend for some fresh seafood in the area.  Probably best for parties of 4 or less as most of the tables were booth that would fit 4 (at most) and bar seating.",5,9/13/2016,Saltie Girl
264,"This place was awesome. We ordered the fried lobster and waffle which was completely worth the $32 and fifteen minute wait. It was surprisingly complex for what you'd think would be a very straight forward dish. Great decor. Friendly, attentive, and prompt staff. Would not only go again but recommend everyone else go, too.",5,9/18/2016,Saltie Girl
265,"Impeccable service, sweet, briny lobster cocktail, rich, creamy fried lobster on waffle. Great little lobster bar right off the main drag of back bay",4,9/18/2016,Saltie Girl

They dont take reservations everyone!.  So lets just begin with the bartender ..christiano the kid is hilarious and super personable even under busy conditions, he recommended everything we got and was so passionate and excited about chef kyles food .  Hands down best dinner and experience ive had in a very long time and will be returning for sure.  Thank you christiano and chef and saltie girl staff for that matter if i could give 6 stars i would! See you all again",5,9/19/2016,Saltie Girl

We let him take the wheel and choose everything we got ! Orange clam from Japan omg so delicious with ponzu and pickled ginger they make in house yum!  Torched salmon belly to die for !  We got a bunch of delicious tins that will blow your mind ! Comes with three salts amazing bread and pequilla jam ! It changed my perception of tinned food that's for sure it's amazing ! I will be back to try more ! Thanks saltie girl staff it was great !",5,9/21/2016,Saltie Girl
269,"1 star service, 3 star food... Terrible service by hostess and bartender/waiter. We put our name in at 7:30 and were told it would be about a 40 minute wait, the hostess took our phone number to call us when our table was ready. We returned at 8:20 to check on the status of our table. Many names below ours had been crossed off the list and we were told we were next in line. We had never received a call. We then waited for another 15 minutes and watched as another group was seated in front of us. We asked if they were waiting for longer than us, the hostess' response was ""yes, technically."" The service from there was slow and unfriendly... When our server finally did come to us, seated at the bar, he was pushy and tried to get us to order only the most expensive items. Decor is nice, food was decent once it arrived but won't be in a hurry back. Very disappointing.",2,9/23/2016,Saltie Girl
270,"This is everything a restaurant should be. The food was incredible. We would have been happy with anything on the menu, and the things we got were outstanding! We had oysters, hamachi loin, fried lobster and waffle, and cockle. All were so good!! You have to get the lobster and waffle. And we LOVED our waitress. She was so helpful and attentive and fun. Highly recommend!",5,9/24/2016,Saltie Girl
271,"Went out looking for Seafood and decided on this place so we could work our way back down Boylston. The bartender (Hannah) was awesome, and gave us the full menu tour, she seemed pretty knowledgeable. We were excited that the menu had so much to offer! We ordered the Scallop Ceviche, not bad, but we have had better (Turtle Kralls - Key West)....As we enjoyed dirty martinis  and ate the ceviche on nearly stale torilla chips, we watched the seafood chef work on a VERY small prep counter. He was doing everything on that counter and using the same gloves, the same knife, the same tea towel, and then he went over and used one of the bartenders liquid bottlles for some mixture with the SAME gloves!!! I am sorry, but I saw all sorts of cross-contamination going on here. Not good, something bad waiting to happen.",2,9/29/2016,Saltie Girl
272,"What in the eff actually makes a burger worth $26? I wonder as I say, ""I'd like the burger, please."" It better be spottieottiedopaliscious.Turns out, when my new bae Saltie says ""burger,"" she also means thick slices of perfectly ripe avocado, a fat strip of house-cured pork belly hanging out the side, and two meaty lobster fritters practically toppling over a toasty sesame bun. Granted, you've still got a juicy gruyere burger with lettuce + tomato + onion to contend with, plus the best crispy fries in town.Is it the most easily eat-able conglomeration of things? No. Should you still eat them? Yes. Don't be a nerd; it's still a burger, so use your hands. They bring you fun towelettes at the end.Tl;dr - Worth it? Yes.",5,10/2/2016,Saltie Girl
273,"The saltie girl is a quite small restaurant and I felt a little cramped sitting at the bar. However the food was delicious and well prepared. Especially the beef tartare, I never knew I would be so impressed by a ""square"" of something lol. It is a little pricy but you do get premium products at a prime location, for that you're not allowed to complain too much.",4,10/7/2016,Saltie Girl
274,only complaint is it's probably the most expensive lobster roll I've had in Boston I asked for a side of Cole slaw and my total came to over $40. with that said the lobster roll was delicious and the Cole slaw was actually really really good as well,4,10/11/2016,Saltie Girl
275,Very elegant and classy the food was really good and not too heavy a great place for people who enjoys tasking food.,4,10/16/2016,Saltie Girl
276,"Came here with a friend on a Friday night - arrived at around 6 pm, and there was already an hour wait. No reservations available.It was totally worth it.FOOD - My friend and I shared 4 dishes:1) Tuna Poke - highly recommend! It was such a perfect combination of tuna to sauce. One of my favorite dishes of the night.2) Torched Salmon Belly - I prefer the Tuna Poke over this, but it was still delicious. Saltie Girl is very generous with the avocado, which made me very happy.3) Fried Lobster & Waffle - favorite dish of the night! The waffle was so soft and pillowy, it was like eating clouds. Paired with the sweet corn butter on top and the spicy maple syrup on the side, it was amazing.4) Snow Crab toasts - It was good, but after the fried lobster & waffle, it just couldn't compare.SERVICE - goodOVERALL - recommend!",5,10/16/2016,Saltie Girl
277,"Very cute little place specializing in finger seafood from oysters to caviar to raw tuna to sardines. Good selection of drinks and wine. This reminds me of Parisian oyster bars. The food was delicious and the crowd was quite, a mixture of locals and business people. The servers/chef were not that welcoming (my only complain) but that might be because I am used to the hospitality of the South or maybe because I did not order caviar! I would definitely recommend it.",4,10/16/2016,Saltie Girl
278,"Delicious.Come early for brunch AKA right when they open, as they do not take reservations.

279,"Came here on a trip for training with my coworker. Holy crap it's incredible, eclectic, and fresh. They make all their ceviches and raw platters on the spot right in front of you at the bar.

This is the place to be if you're looking for creative drinks and great seafood.",5,10/19/2016,Saltie Girl
280,"I stopped into Saltie Girl on a Wednesday afternoon at around 2-3 PM, as I was waiting for a friend to get off work.  I did a few quick searches in Back Bay for ""Lobster Rolls"" and Saltie Girl popped up a few times. I had an order of the Tuna Poke to start, and then got a warm Lobster Roll.  Both were great -- quick service at the bar.  I was upset I didn't order the Fried Lobster and Waffles, but a couple at the table behind me ordered it and it looked amazing.  Maybe next time.The restaurant is pretty small, but there is a large counter/bar for quicker service.  Little on the pricey side, but the food was fresh, tasty, and the service was friendly!",4,10/20/2016,Saltie Girl
281,"Visiting from SF area, we were delighted to find this small but wonderful restaurant.  Everything we had was delicious.  We most enjoyed the crab toast and the gnocchi.  Great area to walk around after dinner as well.   Service was great with a very nice server.  Loved it.",5,10/20/2016,Saltie Girl
282,This place is really cool. Had a lunch of oysters and crudo. Both tasted fresh and delicious. Kind of a small place so you might need to wait a bit or go early.  I would definitely go back.,5,10/21/2016,Saltie Girl
283,"This place was recommended by a co-workers fried, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Being my first time in Boston I was hoping for something local and was open to anything.  We called to make reservations and they indicated they don't take them over the phone.  So our plan was walk over, sign in and grab a drink at a bar close by.     Walking in the place was small, quaint, and the friendly hostess indicated the wait was only an hour (Not bad for a hot spot at 7pm on a Friday Night).  Immediately, I noticed all the Tins, the seafood bar and cozy cubby seating.  I grew even more excited and couldn't wait.  They recommended we grab a drink next door at the Met Back Bay.   When we finally got the call we rushed over.   Its seemed like we ordered everything, Hamacihi, Toro, Scallops, NE Clam Chowder, oh and yes the TIN.  We ordered the Bocarte ala Cazuela.  They were warmed up, served with this amazing bread.  My experience was absolutely Wonderful!!  It's rare to find unique treasures like this on a work trip.  My wife's been begging me to come to Boston for the longest.  When we come back, I can't wait to share this experience with her.",5,10/22/2016,Saltie Girl
284,Had the lobster Benedict and the bagel was stale. My friend also ordered the same thing and his was equally as stale. It taste like they microwaved the bagel to reheat it after it had been toasted. Or maybe it was just really old. It was incredibly hard to cut and chew. I asked for a steak knife and still could not cut through it. We told the bartender and what appeared to be the host/manager. They did nothing nor did they comp or discount us. The bill was $64+ for two lobster Benedict a on stale old bagels and poor customer service. It was also a very measly amount of lobster on the Benedict. Simply not worth it. Don't be fooled the pictures and cute decore.,1,10/22/2016,Saltie Girl
285,"The service was impeccable - Michael made our night! It was our first time there, we had a quick getaway weekend from Minneapolis, and we wanted something local, chic, and fresh- and it did not disappoint. I loved the concept of the small plates, that way you could try a lot more of the food items. We started with the sardine tin - delicious. Then had the gnocchi with caviar - and the caviar actually made the gnocchi. And the salmon belly was absolutely scrumptious. They served it with apples and avocado, agh! So good! Oh, and my boyfriend had a cocktail, the Bourbon with apple cider and cinnamon and he legit said it was his fav ever. Go there, it's worth it.",5,10/23/2016,Saltie Girl
286,"My husband and I are here 3 times in our 5 days in Boston. It is hands down one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Everything on the menu is amazing. Excellent service! The restaurant is small so you may have to wait but it is worth it. Their hot lobster rolls are life changing. Definitely try the steak tartare, snow crab toast, gnocchi with caviar and smoked atlantic salmon toast. Even the cocktails and wine list are top notch. We are traveling foodies and we will definitely make it back to Boston to eat here.",5,10/23/2016,Saltie Girl

288,"Visiting from Chicago and had a phenomenal meal! Had the crab/avocado toast for a starter, the best lobster roll I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot of lobster rolls) and gnocchi with caviar - which was amazingly light, pan fried so it had a crispy bottom and soooooo good. The entire meal from start to finish was absolutely delicious. Service was great - very friendly and perfect timing between courses. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Boston.",5,10/30/2016,Saltie Girl
289,Magnificent.  I absolutely loved the pickled beet salad.  The gnocci with caviar was even better & finally the steak tartare with truffles was stunning.  I thought it weird ordering that at a fish place but omg..one of the best things ive ever put in my mouth.  I hope I have the opportunity to go back some day.,5,11/1/2016,Saltie Girl
290,"Wow! I have wanted to try this for a while, luckily I left work a little early so today was the day! Everyone was so nice and helpful. I initially went if for the lobster and waffles but after looking at all of the other options I wanted to try something different that I've never had before so I went with the tinned jalapeño tuna, so happy I did, it was delicious!I will be back for the lobster and waffles!",5,11/3/2016,Saltie Girl
291,"This place is amazing on every level. Our waiter Michael was incredibly helpful with very nuanced and descriptive advice about the menu. He was so friendly and enthusiastic about everything, especially the items he felt strongly about. Michael is amazing. With regard to the restaurant in general, get the torched salmon belly, the steak tartare (I know, it's a seafood place, by the truffle in this is unreal), the lobster cocktail, and more. You will not be disappointed. We had to wait 45 min for two seats at the bar but it was totally worth it. This place offers stuff I've never seen before. Check it out!",5,11/4/2016,Saltie Girl
292,The best meal we had in Boston! The mussels and oysters were amazing. Lobster roll was overflowing with meat. The house-made bread and butter were outstanding. The burger and clam chowder were decadent. Would definitely not miss!,5,11/6/2016,Saltie Girl

Anyway, come here for good seafood. It's pretty dope.",5,11/6/2016,Saltie Girl

296,"This was the WORST dining experience i've ever had. We waited over 3 hours for a table and when we arrived after receiving a call that our ""table"" was ready, we were seated at the bar. We specifically said we will wait for a table because we did not want to eat at the bar. We were then told we couldn't be served drinks because Met Bar, their sister restaurant next door, called them and told them not to serve us. Not only were we completely SOBER and ordered two waters at Met Bar, but when we asked the manager what was going on, he was extremely rude and disrespectful. I've never met a manager that was so defensive and straight-up mean. The host was the same way. We still are so confused about the entire experience.The fact that we waited for hours to get seated at the bar, were told we shouldn't have even been served food, and were treated with complete disrespect is something i've never experienced at a restaurant, let alone a new restaurant.I regret dining there and would not recommend this place to ANYONE.",1,11/7/2016,Saltie Girl
297,I agree with Tom G. I don't get the tinned seafood. Although they do beautify it with condiments and bread. The presentation is impressive. I had the fluke. It was awesome. Friend had the lobster roll which was huge! Drinks at the Met next door were great too. Very tiny place.,4,11/7/2016,Saltie Girl
298,"This is a cute brunch spot on Newbury St, especially for all the seafood lovers out there! The restaurant is small and cozy and can seat around 30-35 ppl so the wait for weekend brunch can be 30-1hr depending on how busy they are. But the good thing is that this is on Newbury St!They have a lot of interesting dishes on the menu. They also have an oyster bar and crudo. I tried the uni egg's benedict, steak tartare, saltie girl burger, and fried calamari. Everything was super delicious. The egg's benedict is a little different from the traditional. It comes with uni, quail egg, a toast. It was delicious and the flavors were balanced and uni was fresh. However, I thought it was a little on the pricey side for the portion size. The steak tartare was amazing. It was seasoned well with a touch of truffle oil. Although, I wished that there could be a touch of lime juice or something to add some acidity so that the flavors would be more balanced. The fried calamari was decent, the sauce that came with it was unimpressive and I don't know how I feel about the fried chorizo that came with it. The chorizo was overpowering and was very dry after being fried. The burger was delicious. The fries were the star of the show on this dish! The burger came with lobster, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and hamburger. I did not blend of the burger because the burger was a little on the dry side and not very flavorful. It was also overcooked because I asked for medium rare. This restaurant has a lot of interesting dishes on the menu that I have yet to try and hope the other dishes will be better! I would recommend trying this place!!!",3,11/8/2016,Saltie Girl
299,"A really excellent experience here, as always. Putting aside the delicious food and drinks, it's just a nice environment to be in. I love sitting at the counter and watching the food be prepared. This place just makes me happy and warm, a welcome respite from the cold chaos of the Copley area.",5,11/9/2016,Saltie Girl
300,What a great place. Fabulous dishes and extremely inventive. The staff accommodated me at the bar even though they were packed.Loved it!,5,11/10/2016,Saltie Girl

302,"Waited a little over an hour to be seated on a Saturday around 2pm, which was fine since the Back Bay Area is so cute and we had fun walking around and peeking in the little shops. We started off with the tinned anchovies - a little too saltie for our taste. Next was the New England clam chowder. I'm from San Francisco so I had to try the clam chowder on my first trip to Boston. Each spoonful had the right proportions of clams, potatoes and soup and it was oh so yummy. Then came the fried calamari and chorizo. The calamari was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, but we weren't big fans of the chorizo. The hot lobster roll came with large pieces of meat which was great, but there wasn't enough butter to make it melt in our mouths. We would definitely recommend stopping by this seafood gem if you're in the Back Bay Area.",4,11/12/2016,Saltie Girl
303,"When my sister and I left after dinner, we agreed it was one of the tastiest meals we've had in a long time! The space is small but once you get a table/seat at the bar you'll know it was well worth the wait.We had a can of tuna in olive oil/garlic sharing plate. It came with homemade bread/jam and we couldn't get enough of it. We also had brussel sprouts and shared the lobster & waffles! It was like a warm, delicious dessert after a the savory appetizers.Also I'd like to note Michael provided such delightful service the whole time!! If I'm ever back in Boston I will go back to Saltie Girl!",5,11/13/2016,Saltie Girl
304,"From decor to food to service, this place is excellent. The service was friendly and knowledgeable. The decor featured many shades of blue tiles, a display of the restaurant's tinned fish collection and a bar made for mermaids. The restaurant is on the smaller scale, with a raw seafood bar and a few seating booths. Came here for brunch with three friends and waited 45 minutes but the food was totally worth the wait. All the ingredients used were quality and the seafood was fresh. They're also very generous with the avocado which made me very happy.Torched salmon belly - who knew that there could be more ways to eat salmon. The salmon was laid on top of a layer of avocado and were both torched. The cucumber, green apple and miso glaze brought out the freshness of the salmon, while the smokey flavor gave it a multi-dimensional flavor.Snow crab toast - featured shredded snow crab, generous amounts of avocado, pistachios, and stracciatella all atop toasted bread. This dish was fresh, light and creamy, great for sharing as an appetizer.Hand-chopped dry aged steak tartare - the ingredients in this dish are truffle aioli, buttered brioche, quail egg and parmesan. How can one not try this dish after reading the list of ingredients. The presentation and taste of this dish screamed gourmet. It was one of the best steak tartares I've had.Uni benedict - featured sunny side up quail egg, hollandaise and bioce. The uni was fresh and the dish was creamy. The only thing is the portion of this dish was very small so it was difficult to share.Fried lobster and waffle - the dish was paired with sweet corn butter and spicy maple syrup. The lobster was tender and delicious. We wish there were more on the waffle. The butter and syrup gave the dish a nice blend of sweet and savory with a little kick of spiciness.I highly recommend this place for brunch. Prepare to splurge a little when you come here.",5,11/13/2016,Saltie Girl
305,"Saltie Girl is probably my favorite seafood restaurant in the Back Bay right now. Here's the rundown: - Crab Toast - Must Order - Tuna Carpaccio - Solid - Salmon Belly Crudo - Solid - Torched Salmon Belly - really good as long as they go easy on the char  - Tinned  - I still haven't figured out the Tinned Seafood. I thought the sardines would be a layup for me, but I didn't love them. Good, but for $18, you need to love what's coming out of that tin.  - Lobster Bisque and Chowder - both good but neither are must haves. Bisque is heavy - Salmon Toast - Fantastic if you're into Smoked Fish - Foie Gras Toast - Pass. Not sure what I was thinking. After a dozen attempts trying Foie over the years, I don't get it - Lobster Roll - Good but not in the top 5 - Fried Clams - Pass - Calamari - like the Fried Clams, PassLast Note: One of the few place in the city get a Hitachino White",4,11/19/2016,Saltie Girl
306,"Stumbled in here and it ended up being one of the better meals of my life. Oysters, tuna poke, salmon belly, and beets were all exquisite.",5,11/20/2016,Saltie Girl
307,"Absolutely amazing - a top meal of all time. Went with a friend for lunch on a Sunday afternoon around 1 pm. Had to wait for 30 minutes but luckily this is a great area to walk around and keep you busy while you wait (we decided on a quick shop at Nordstrom Rack). It's a small space, so regardless, just expect to wait. But it's totally worth it no matter how long you wait. We sat at the bar. Decor is cutesie and sweet. Server/bartender was knowledgeable and helpful in making our selections - since we basically wanted everything. The steak tartare literally blew our minds - best steak tartare I've ever had, and potentially one of the best things I've ever eaten. My friend said this might be her death bed food. We also had the fried lobster and waffles. I don't think I could even possibly use the right words to adequately describe the perfection that this was. I will have dreams of both of these flavors. We also shared the tuna poke - definitely an excellent item - but it was hard to live up to the other two.",5,11/21/2016,Saltie Girl
308,"Every bite was delicious, and the drinks, and the service. Salmon belly crudo, snow crab toast, lobster and waffles (I know, you're scratching your head, but get it). Didn't try the tins or oysters, only so much room in my stomach. I would go again in a second.",5,11/22/2016,Saltie Girl
309,"Amazing! Lovely diner, excellent service and good food. Definitely must have the fried lobster and savoury waffles with maple sauce. It's so well balanced and one of a kind. Good selection of oysters - our fav was Marionport followed by Salt Nuggets if you like them sweet. Lobster roll and Snow crab toast was good but not great.",5,11/25/2016,Saltie Girl
310,"Excellent! Waited an hour for table but worth the wait. Scallop ceviche and lobster roll were both particularly amazing. Excellent service and ambiance. Had a cute New England vibe but also great music during dinner, my husband and I really enjoyed it. Loved the moist towelettes at the end too, nice touch.",5,11/26/2016,Saltie Girl
311,Very disappointed. Called to reserve and was told they don't take reservations. Said I was hold be there in 15-20 mins and was told should be ok no wait but could take my number. Took a 15 minute cab ride. Arrived and was told it was a 45 minute wait.  This is a ploy to get you to come and get in line. I hate waiting and was more than pissed at this behavior. Cant rate it good because they never got the chance. Smile all you like girl - 45 minutes is unacceptable.,1,11/30/2016,Saltie Girl
312,"Wow.. I saw this place a couple weeks ago and decided to give it a try with my boyfriend on a busy Saturday night. They don't take reservations, not a big deal. The hostess immediately wrote our names and phone number and invited us to grab a drink at Met Bar. We did not have to wait for long since it was a party of 2 and we had no preference between the table or the bar. We skipped the big meals and decided to start with some drinks and appetizers, I'm so glad we did. We had the pineapple drink, Sake, Oysters, BlueFin Tuna, Ceviche, Salmon (I forgot the name, it comes with Avocado) Caviar Gnocchi and Brussel sprouts. My boyfriend and I were delighted with the quality, the freshness and the outstanding service of this place!! We loved sitting at the bar and watching the chefs doing their thing. We had so much fun with our bartender and our waiter was amazing as well. We will definitely come back since we have some more dishes we didn't try. Can't wait to come back!",5,12/1/2016,Saltie Girl
313,"We showed up just past 5:40 and were quoted a 30-minute wait time by a really nice and apologetic waitress. The place was packed already, although it's pretty small - total capacity looked like 20-30 people. 20 minutes later my phone rang and we ran (literally) to claim our booth.We started by ordering a dozen oysters, some raw clams and the market special, a scallop ceviche. The oysters and clams were beautifully presented, fresh, clean and flavorful; my boyfriend swooned over the ceviche (best he's ever had, he said) - the scallops were tender and flavorful with chucks of avocado. We also had the garlic clam toast (4/5), steak tartare toast (5/5) and fried lobster & waffles (6/5, if that's a thing). The garlic clam toast would've been perfect if not for the chiles on the toast that overpowered the flavor of the clams, in my opinion, but still was delicious. The steak tartare toast was actually deconstructed - it came as a bowl of steak tartare with toasted brioche mixed in, which was a surprise but really delicious. As native Texan, I love chicken & waffles, so the lobster & waffle was amazing - lightly fried, fresh lobster, a fluffy waffle and rich sweet corn butter. YUM.Service and decor were all on point. Get here early to avoid a wait. Can't wait to come back.",5,12/1/2016,Saltie Girl
314,"lunch recently, we got there early so no problem getting in, a smallish place with a long dining bar on one side and table/booths on the other, sort of reminds of neptune oyster(?), service was pleasant and menu interesting, lots of canned (tinned) seafood option's.....wife had the fried oysters, very good and nicely presented and the squash assortment, also great looking and some came home for dinner, i had the b u r g e r which was served with a piece of fried lobster which we shared, burger was excellent and as ordered.....drinks\s were good, very nice small place with good food, on the pricey side as martini was $16.....we got to seat at the front on the 2 pull out seats which was nice on a sunny day!!",4,12/3/2016,Saltie Girl
315,"LOVED Saltie Girl. If I lived in Boston, I would be here at least once a week. It was definitely better by far than the other 4 restaurants I tried while I was here. Everything on their menu looks so amazing that I am depressed I was only able to try a couple things. And the ambiance is adorable--light and airy, like a beach house. First, the sake. It was so light and delicious that I found myself craving it the next day. For food, I got the pesto escargot, which were just awesomely flavorful--I was sopping up the sauce with the bread. And then I got the lobster and waffles--and let me tell you, they do NOT skimp on the lobster! There was enough that I had a healthy portion with every bite of waffle. I want to come back and try all the toasts, and the carbonara, and the oysters, and the bisque...I will definitely insist to whoever my next Boston travel partner is that we make a stop here!",5,12/4/2016,Saltie Girl
316,Delicious food. Pricey. But worth it. Highly recommend the lobster and waffles. So buttery and amazing!,5,12/4/2016,Saltie Girl
317,"Amazing food, amazing service. Great oysters, cocktails, and all around fun menu with many options to explore.",5,12/8/2016,Saltie Girl
318,"This nonchalant tiny place has some of the best sea food I've had in New England. It's not cheap, but it is priced similarly to other comparable restaurants in the area and the quality is better. Highly recommend for adventurous foodies.",5,12/10/2016,Saltie Girl
319,"I shouldn't be posting this because it means the waits will be longer.  Best newish restaurant I've tried in Boston in a while.  Great execution, some creativity but they don't try to do TOO much with it.  I just wish the location was a bit larger so I never had to wait.Out of all we tried, the only thing that failed was the foie gras PB&J.  No stars removed bc everything else was just SO good (uni Benedict, oysters, clam chowder, French bread side, gnocchi with caviar, lobster and waffles)",5,12/11/2016,Saltie Girl
320,"This place has become one of my favorite seafood spots in town.  Small place, small menu but every dish is packed with tons of great flavors and textures.  Our favorites are ANYTHING and EVERYTHING UNI!  From the half to the full orders of uni to the uni benadicts.  Mouth watering drool.  The seared salmon belly with apple is off the hook!  The poke is much comparable to Hawaii.  Come with a date or your best girl pals and be ready to eat some creative and freshest seafood in town.",4,12/12/2016,Saltie Girl
321,"Prices were a bit high, and seating was extremely limited - the menu wasn't that extensive so really make sure you have a reservation, are willing to spend the money and check the menu first. Service was good. Just wasn't the experience we expected.",4,12/13/2016,Saltie Girl
322,"I came here on a Wednesday night for my friends birthday dinner. Unfortunately we couldn't make reservations but I figured it wouldn't be too crowded during the middle of the week. We were seated about 15 minutes later but our server Michael was super attentive to us even before we sat down keeping us updated on how long the wait may be. Michael explained the whole menu to us, giving us great suggestions. We started with the sea urchin - it was my first time trying it so I have nothing to really compare it to. I liked it. Then came the torched salmon belly with avocado which our server recommended. Great choice! We also had the calamari and pastrami smoked salmon. Oh my god the pastrami smoked salmon was delicious. We had to order something from the tin because they had a huge selection of tinned stuff. I was a little skeptical but we tried the jalapeño tinned tuna. It came with bread, whipped butter, jalapeños, and other condiments. Like everything else I tried here so far, it was delicious. All the appetizers came out timely so it didn't crowd our table up too much. By the time we were done with the appetizers I was pretty full. But then came the main dish - cape bay scallop carbonara. It was a huge portion and I was only able to eat half of it. I would definitely come back here again. Michael was an awesome server - so attentive and enthusiastic. He made our experience here so much better. Only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because they don't take reservations. Also it took a little while after we sat down to be attended to. Seeing that it's a pretty small place, I would have assumed someone would have been with us right away. However as soon as Michael noticed that no one had come to our table to introduce themselves, he took it upon himself to take over and definitely made the rest of our night.",4,12/14/2016,Saltie Girl
323,"In town from the Bay Area for work and a friend from Boston recommended this place - lucky for me it was very close to where I'm staying. The food. Oh. My. Goodness. The torched salmon crudo was absolutely incredible - still thinking about it. I also got the burger, which was also fabulous. I mean, what's not to like about a hamburger with pork belly, fried lobster, and avocado??? Wine was delicious. Atmosphere is cool. I definitely plan on returning when I'm in town next time! Only downside is that my waiter was grumpy and kinda made me feel like I was an annoyance - kind of giving him the benefit of the doubt that it was a bad day in only taking off one star cause bad service really is no bueno.",4,12/14/2016,Saltie Girl
324,"Food was incredible.  I got the lobster and waffles. Absolutely recommend.  One star off because the server I had was clearly 'bothered' to serve me.  Which was a shame, because the other server was over the top friendly with his tables.  But yeah,  get you some LOBSTER AND WAFFLES!!!!!!  So glad I was able to stop here after my trade show :)",4,12/16/2016,Saltie Girl
325,"Had a great experience grabbing lunch here! The staff was phenomenal! They were all very attentive. Huge plus! Interior and atmosphere was very 'under the sea' which I loved! Not a lot of seating but worth the wait.We tried one of their Toasts, the Saltie Girl Burger, Brussels sprouts, Lobster+waffle, and some Oysters! The oysters were of course my favorite especially being in Boston. Everything was delicious and fresh. Food was a bit salty, especially the burger and I usually like salty. But overall, everything was worth it.Can't wait to go back and try more things! Menu is impressive! Glad to have found a seafood place near Copley that's worth it.",5,12/16/2016,Saltie Girl
326,"Tried Saltie Girl for the second time for brunch. I'd been for dinner shortly after it opened and had wonderful food but my group experienced extremely rude behavior from one of the managers - honestly, behavior I have never seen in a restaurant before. I was hopeful that this was just the stress of a new restaurant and would go away once they were really up and running. Returned for brunch at the bar with a friend. Our server acted irritated that we were there - did not introduce himself, ask about drinks, ask if we'd been in before, or have anything to say about the menu. He declined to substitute French fries for chips on a $32 lobster roll. He then walked away before we had finished our order and we had to call him back to complete it, but he put his back to us and walked away again before we could order drinks! It took three more tries to get his attention to order a drink. Our food was very good but not enough to make up for the overall experience.",2,12/17/2016,Saltie Girl
327,"Great atmosphere and service! Came here on my own during a visit to Boston. Everything on the menu looked amazing. Unfortunately I couldn't possibly eat everything, so I had to choose. I picked the fried lobster, and the pasta special - white truffle cavatelli. The flavor in the cavatelli was so good. The pasta itself was a bit undercooked - a minute or two more would've been perfect al dente. But I ate it all anyways because it would've broken my heart to waste truffle. The fried lobster left a bit to be wished for. The pieces were all a bit overcooked - rubbery. I was definitely struggling on a few bites and just ended up swallowing bites whole. The service was amazing however, and they took care of it right away.Despite the lobster mishap, I'd certainly come again and try the rest of the menu someday!",5,12/18/2016,Saltie Girl
328,"Stopped in here for appetizers & drinks. They oysters were incredibly fresh. Garlic toast with bacon jam and clams was euphoric. Our grapefruit cocktail had the perfect proportion of juice and vodka. In addition, our waiter, Michael, made the experience complete. Next time we come back to Boston, we will definitely be back for dinner.",5,12/19/2016,Saltie Girl
329,"I have to admit, I am in love with Saltie Girl. The service is always spectacular sitting at the bar-I leave it up to the bartender who never disappoints in ordering my food (I can never decide). The food is always fresh, different, and delicious. It's always busy but worth the wait.A big thanks to Christiano and the Saltie Girl crew!Will be back again and again and again.",5,12/20/2016,Saltie Girl
330,One word for this place...yum!!! I would highly recommend this place for seafood lovers! I got the scallop carbonara and a dozen of the various regional oysters. The oysters were super fresh and my favorite of this place! The service was excellent and even though I just walked in and was told there was an hour and half wait at the end it turned out to be only 45 minute wait! This place is so tiny so come early to put your name in and then go shop or next door to the Met bar for a drink or two! I highly recommend this place!!!,5,12/29/2016,Saltie Girl
331,Loved Saltie girl!  We were lucky enough toget seats at the bar at dinner time and watch the magic. The seafood is fresher than fresh. Servers have great recommendations. The beef tartare was amazing- never would have ordered it without the tip from behind the bar. Scallop/uni/caviar special was unreal. Final bill was $100/pp but we ate and drank our full.,5,12/29/2016,Saltie Girl
332,"Cozy, intimate little bar on Dartmouth St in the Back Bay. I initially walked by thinking it was some kind of clothing company but then noticed people sitting at a bar. There are a bunch of small booths perfect for couples or groups of 4 and a long bar. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Tons of tinned and preserved fish from Spain and Portugal, beautifully served on platters with fresh bread and pickles. The tuna poke was a generous serving of large cubes of fresh tuna in a soy, scallion and sesame sauce. The menu is crazy interesting with fresh oysters, all of the tinned goods, crudo, small plates, large plates, toasts and so much more. I see many more visits in the future. Would be a great date night option or drinks/apps with girlfriends. It's all about the seafood but there are a couple of non-fish options (although that's kind of like going to a steak house if you're a vegetarian right?).",5,12/29/2016,Saltie Girl
333,"Excellent service and fantastic food. I had the lobster and waffle. It didn't look like much at first but when you take a bite with all the flavors (syrup included) it's like heaven.  I love the atmosphere, it's casual but done well.",5,12/31/2016,Saltie Girl
334,"Never thought I'd be happy about paying this much for canned sardines, but it is fantastic. Good drinks, incredible fresh (and canned) seafood. Pricey but what the hell.",5,1/2/2017,Saltie Girl
335,"I was pretty pleased with my snow crab toast but that plus a bowl of chowder ran me about $30 and wasn't quite a full meal. But man the quality at Saltie girl is high. You probably need to be prepared to spend about $50 per person on just food to really do it, making this a great occasion spot/fancy date night joint.",4,1/3/2017,Saltie Girl
336,"We were really looking forward to having this restaurant in our neighborhood. What a disappointment. They do not take reservations.  I get that.  It is a very small place so we always tried to get there early-before six.  On three separate occasions when we got there, there were two booths that were empty.  EACH time we were told that they were being saved for SOMEONE ON THE WAY.  Really????? If you are holding a table, then you have a reservation.  It was absolutely disgusting.  They were arrogant and frankly we not only will never go back, but I will tell literally everyone not to go.  I have been to many, many five star restaurants, of which this is not, and have never been subjected to such dismissive and discriminatory treatment.  Do not go here.  If there existed negative stars. that's what they would be awarded.",1,1/5/2017,Saltie Girl
337,This place is amazing. The food is out of this world. Seafood is so fresh. People so nice. The only low point is the price although it's worth it once in a while bc of the quality of the seafood,5,1/6/2017,Saltie Girl
338,"they finally started taking reservations!!! only took half a year but i don't blame them cuz this place is tiny!! as you could expect a back bay restaurant to bemy favorite things about saltie girl are their immense attention to detail and. this place puts tons of thought into what they do and it really shows!! they understand that food needs to not only taste awesome but look amazing too. many of the presentation of the dishes and drinks here totally took me by surprise!! lets talk about drinks first: the Pineapple cocktail (Elyx, Yuzu, lemongrass, citrus soda) is a must!! it comes in THE CUTEST container ever. it's a brass pineapple held up by the crown of the pineapple itself. it's topped with mint leaves to replicate a real looking pineapple. you also get brass straws!!! their peach cocktail is also served in brass. their bloody mary is topped with a raw oyster!! the coconut cocktail comes in a traditional milk glass with a stainless steel straw (so cute and eco-friendly!!), the pistachio drink comes in a tiny little coconut. literally way too cute to be realas for the food--the snow crab toast comes with hefty portions of crab and also avocado!! i would highly recommend it. their scallop ceviche is served over a bowl of ice. this makes the presentation 37493x better!! more places should do that to go for the wow factor. double chin does that with their Under the Sea and Fish Bowl drinks.  they have a version of chicken n waffles here except it's served with fried lobster tails!! it comes with maple syrup and melted butter of course. the steak tartare comes on a wooden block and the tartare is actually cubed and topped with microgreens!! it's the cutest thing ever :D they have a surf n turf burger that comes with fried lobster tail and also pork belly strips. this is pure INSANITY!!!! one thing i wasn't really a fan of was the fried lobster. this was nothing really worth mentioning and can be made anywhere. it takes the spotlight away from all the other genius inventions on the menu and it doens't add much value in my opinion. this is my only ""complaint"" for this place. if you can even call it thaton the subject of lobster--the hot lobster roll comes with chips and OMGGGG this def gives b&g and neptune a run for their titles!! it comes with an almost overwhelming amount of lobster meat on there. this is a must get for lobster lovers or tourists!!i know they had fried clams here in the summer but not sure if that'll cotinue through the winter. that would be amazing though since my go-to clam shacks close for the season!!",5,1/6/2017,Saltie Girl
339,"Inspired by Barcelona seafood spots, this Back Bay interpretation casts a wide net, serving #fish dishes raw, fried, smoked, and even tinned (culled from imported specialties) in a small setting dominated by a raw bar and shucking station. The all-day menu is matched with refreshing cocktails and a wine list stressing bottles of white and rosé.",4,1/6/2017,Saltie Girl
340,"Seafood and tinned fish, some new and stylish stuff coming through Boston. We ordered a lot.  The tinned fish selection is HUGE.  And the server is very helpful in making selections. For me anything other than tuna is good for tinned fish. (Tuna shouldn't be cooked, especially the good stuff imho)We also got the poke which was wonderful, and among the best some of us have had.  The uni was very good and was a game changer to one of our friends who tried it for the first time. The carbonara was pretty good.  Crudo was very good.Overall the setup is cute.  Not much space, well lit, lots of energy.  The turnover was faster than we expected and we got seated way earlier than their estimates.  No reservations btw, and all party members must be present.Just go. It's a must try.",5,1/7/2017,Saltie Girl
341,"Fried lobster, a great bar program and the most underrated burger in Boston.Saltie Girl is such a fantastic experience that I was finally convinced to write my first yelp review. Every single time I have dined here, the food, drinks, service, and ambience have been on point. The nautical decor and intimate setting is perfect for a date night, catching up with friends, or impressing the parents when they're in town. Cocktails are excellent and they carry a range of wines that pair perfectly with the seafood-centric menu. The staff is friendly, efficient and well-informed - always happy to help one navigate a slightly intimidating raw/tinned menu. In terms of dishes, you really can't go wrong with the Fried Lobster & Waffles, Tuna Poke, Torched Salmon Belly and of course - the Saltie Girl Burger. One would think that avocado, fried lobster, and pork belly on a burger would be overkill but somehow it all comes together and creates one of the most absurdly delicious bites in town. The fries are also excellent - crisp, fluffy, and well seasoned. I recommend ordering the classic crowd-pleasers and a few tinned/raw selections to share while also trying dishes like the black garlic butter escargot or Uni Benedict - well executed and delicious. I honestly believe that you could close your eyes, point at the menu and end up with something great. In short, Saltie Girl is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and I'm happy to see it getting the positive recognition it deserves!",5,1/7/2017,Saltie Girl

343,This is a neat little out of the way oyster bar. We looked it up on Yelp before we came but walked past the place once before turning back to find it. Very small. A bar plus 5 booths. We had an awesome two person drink called a Pineapple and a wonderful cheese tray. Service was prompt but unobtrusive. Highly recommend if you are out and about and need a quick snack/drink.,5,1/10/2017,Saltie Girl
344,"Found this great spot on Yelp while in Boston. Was shopping around this cute neighborhood at Copley Square and searched for nearby restaurant. I wanted seafood and this place came up with good reviews. This restaurant was tiny but comfortable and inviting décor. They had about 6 booths which can accommodate 4 or more and the rest were bar stool seats which they had about, I think 10 or 12. I arrived around 4pm on a Saturday and it's already packed but luckily, there was 1 bar seat available. The friendly bar tender / server insisted it's the best seat in the house and sure it was.I ordered this Grapefruit gin drink. It was potent but refreshing at the same time. As I watched him prepped me another one (because it was that good), started with Snow Crab toast for app and then followed by Torched Salmon Belly. All I can say is wow! The toast had a mountain of fresh crab. The salmon had a nice crunch from the torched edges and perfectly cooked. It's no wonder Salty Girl has nearly perfect five star rating. Their food offerings and service go hand in hand....excellence! A must stop if you are in Boston :)",5,1/10/2017,Saltie Girl
345,"While visiting Boston for New Years, my husband and I came here because of good reviews. Being spoiled in NYC with so many good options, we had to look way harder to find a good restaurant than we would back home based on online reviews.The food was good. We had the tuna, seared salmon, sole, and lobster roll. The stand outs were the sole (I think it was sole-it could have been a different white fish, I don't remember but it comes with spinach and potatoes) and lobster role (my husband loved it) which were delicious. We had 2 different white wines-one of them was delicious, the other wasn't really my taste. I took the first star off because the space is tiny and were told that the wait for a table is about 2 hours and for the bar we could be seated right away. So we chose the bar. We actually ended up waiting 45 minutes (I stayed because my husband wanted to and we also didn't hear fantastic things about the surrounding area's restaurants--it was also freezing cold outside) until we were actually seated at the bar. The woman next to us who came about 15 minutes later than we did got her food before we did and we waited for quite some time to get ours--I even said at one point that I was planning to eat my own arm if the food didn't come soon--it took that long. Another star was taken off for the pricing. Sometimes you go to a restaurant and drop $200 plus and think ""that was steep, but worth it."" For me (yes, it came to $200+ for lunch) this was not one of those times. The prices are outrageous for a cramped space, being seated at the bar with slow service and good food (as opposed to excellent food). Perhaps I feel this way because in NYC I find better food for better prices and atmosphere, but I was not overwhelmed with pleasure as the rest of the reviewers seem to be. We actually paid less at Nobu in NYC for a full dinner than we did here. Overall, 3 stars.",3,1/12/2017,Saltie Girl

347,This is probably one of my favorite places in Boston! It's the kind of place that has the individuality and character only found in cities that have a very good food scene!! The tinned seafood plates are the winning tickets here!,5,1/12/2017,Saltie Girl
348,"Dined here a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised how incredible the food and service was.Came in on a Saturday night the place was packed but it was later in the night and able to grab the one of only have four tables ,the rest is at the bar. Our server was friendly and informative about the food. Had the special of the night and my date had the burger which was absolutely incredible the food is pricey but so darn good -if you can't finish it you'll take it home with you. if you love seafood and quality he will definitely dine here.",5,1/13/2017,Saltie Girl
349,"Forget the lobster rolls and cannolis, no trip to Boston would be complete without a visit to Saltie Girl. I was only in town for four days due to a conference but I prioritized Saltie Girl into my list of ""must-try"" restaurants after reading about all of the attention that it has been receiving by local magazines and it certainly didn't disappoint.Some things to note in advance, the restaurant is quite small and they don't accept reservations. I came by myself after my conference was over for the day, around 8 PM, and was not seated until about an hour later. This didn't bother me too much since it gave me the chance to explore the shops in the surrounding area. Once I was called in from the waiting list, however, I was quickly seated at the bar and I ordered their HAND-CHOPPED DRY AGED STEAK TARTARE as well as their FOIE GRAS BLT - best decisions ever. The steak tartare had so many dimensions of complex flavor due to the rich truffle aioli and the buttery brioche. The foie gras was so luscious and was perfectly complemented by the sweetness of the tomato jam as well as the saltiness of the pork belly. Not only was the food amazing but being seated at the bar allowed me to watch the chefs prepare each dish. It was so fun watching them shave the truffles over my tartare and to see them torch avocados!",5,1/14/2017,Saltie Girl
350,"We went for an early dinner (5:30) here and got a seat right away. This place has a modern, classy vibe, great for small groups of 2-4. We had tinned octopus, which was surprisingly tasty and not as salty as I expected. For the mains, we had the Nantucket bay scallop carbonara and the fried lobster and waffles. The carbonara was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in Boston: perfectly cooked pasta, generous portions of fresh scallops, a poached egg to mix with the pasta, and bits of pork belly to enhance the flavor. The lobster and waffles were well made but I'm not a huge fan of salty/sweet mixed plates. The dishes here are clearly a level above your typical sit-down restaurant.",4,1/16/2017,Saltie Girl
351,"This is one of those places that is definitely worth the hype. First off, the decor and overall vibe is really cute and once you step foot in here, you don't mind the wait. We were three on a Saturday night at 8 just taking a chance so when we heard the wait was only an hour we put our names down gladly. After popping next door for a cocktail, we got the call after about 40 minutes that our table was ready. We shared the steak tartare which was to die for as well as a variety of oysters, a couple tins, and salad. This was a great end to me weekend in Boston and I would definitely recommend this spot for those looking for a delicious, memorable evening.",4,1/17/2017,Saltie Girl
352,"Few booth seats where if you don't have long legs, your foot dangles in the booth.Bar seating sees to be the main attraction of the room.We ordered the steak tartare & sea urchin benedict & torched salmon belly. At almost $20 per dish, $60 for 3 dishes, it barely made me full for one person. I would recommend the steak tartare as the portion is slightly bigger. I didn't find the quail yolk until the end to mix it up because it was hidden in parmesan, but it was super good mixed together.The salmon belly was delicious and the toasted avocado was a nice touch. But again, think tapas portions. I had the highest expectation for the uni benedict, but was quite disappointed when I saw it. Two tiny tiny toasts with a tiny piece of uni that barely is half the size of one serving of uni a la carte from any sushi place.  Felt completely ripped off from the price of the dish. Uni and eggs benedict is my favorite food, and to have it combined would seem like a dream come true, but this one was a letdown. It comes in a giant plate with two shrunken eggs benedict. Perhaps just order uni a la carte. Would not suggest this dish.Pretty expensive and not as satisfying for a complete meal unless you are dropping some serious coins. Perhaps better for drinks and light snacks if you have some $$$ to spend.",3,1/22/2017,Saltie Girl
353,"Excellent well-mixed, hand-crafted, loved cocktails. (Thank you, Chris). Excellent, freshie oysters. House-mixed cocktail and hot sauces. Delish spicy seafood pasta. Looking forward to next time.",4,1/22/2017,Saltie Girl
354,Great friendly staff ... SUPER fresh raw bar -- scallops were like BUTTER!  Really great.  Staff was friendly and welcoming.  Def should try.,5,1/27/2017,Saltie Girl
355,"We live in the North End and went here for the first time during our ""staycation"". We went back 2 days later for more. The food was amazing. The staff was fun and friendly. Highly recommend it!",5,1/29/2017,Saltie Girl
356,This may be one of the best restaurants we've ever been to. The seafood is so fresh and delicious. The raw bay scallops were unbelievable. The servers and chefs know they're stuff. Wish we had this place in New York. Can't wait to come again.,5,1/30/2017,Saltie Girl
357,"I had a terrible experience at Saltie Girl and would actively not recommend eating here.  A heads up that my review is for brunch, not the full dinner menu.  There were several strange things that happened during our meal that added up to me never needing to go back:1)  Because this restaurant doesn't take reservations (no issue there in my book), we got in line before they opened.  At 11:30 on the dot, they let us in and we confirmed we were a party of 4.  The fourth person was just up the block, a 2 min walk away.  They refused to seat us.  Meanwhile, people streamed past and the booths filled up.  The host apologized and said ""there's nothing he could do for us"".  Did I mention I'm 7 MONTHS PREGNANT??  All the booths filled in 30 seconds and then our friend walked in at 11:32.  Having been a waitress, I more than understand a restaurant's challenge of having folks tie up a table as people in their party come and go as they please, but this was just ridiculous.  Clearly the restaurant's policies only consider their bottom line and customer experience is no consideration.2)  Once we were seated, we were given brunch menus.  I ordered coffee.  The waitress explained they ""don't do hot beverages"".  Um, what?  3)  After ordering our food, we were told that dishes come out as they're ready.  This meant that our friend's food arrived 10 min ahead of everyone else's.  She ate alone and then stared at us while we ate our dishes.4)  My plain scrambled eggs were $18.  There were two of them satuarated in butter served with a side of soggy, stale brioche.  I had to hold the caviar unfortunately, because it's something you can't eat while pregnant.  You bet they still charged me the caviar price.Fully admit that maybe I'm not cool enough to understand this place.  But any restaurant that doesn't value customer service in their approach, simply gets crossed off my list.  I give this place two stars,not one, because the staff was very friendly.  Wasn't their fault that their place of work has a crappy business model.  My recommendation, take your $ to Island Creek Oyster House.",2,1/31/2017,Saltie Girl
358,"OMG. What an awesome place. The food is impressive, the service is excellent. The fish tins blew my mind, and the lobster with waffle was irresistible. I would give them 10 stars if I could.",5,2/1/2017,Saltie Girl
359,"Salty attitude more like it. The first big disappointment of 2017 (this is pre- Dump inauguration). Came here in an attempt to have a delightful lunch at 11:45am. Notice that open time is at 11:30. Was unceremoniously turned away at the door w a ""just give us 5 mins."" I suppose I could have done that. Or I suppose you could have been a gracious hostess and let me inside anyway. I could have used those 5 mins to take off my 17 layers (because 35 degrees and windy), look at the menu, check my email, update my Facebook status, whatever. Instead I decided to use those 5 mins to walk over to Porto (which managed to open on time) where the host was elated to see me (fake it till you make 10/10), and devoured a delicious AF fried oyster roll.Le sigh.",2,2/1/2017,Saltie Girl
360,"Extraordinary small spot adjacent to its sister The Met (with whom, thank God, it shares no family resemblance).  Crudo prepared before the eater's eyes with a quiet precision.   ""Toasts"" extraordinarily rich and well-flavored.  Tins of fish of a thousand varieties (though the menu is much broader than trendy tinned fish).  I was stunned by the variety of choices on the menu for such a small space and yet each done with such care: perfect marriages of flavor and texture and a drizzle of oil over all.  The wine list is extraordinary: despite its small size it manages to offer a dozen or more intriguing choices, including a half-dozen roses.  Cocktails as listed are simple to the point of essence; they bring you back to what matters in a cocktail.If the place needs some help, it's with the person(s) assigned the role of welcoming guests.  We stood for a full five minutes while the woman assigned this task assiduously ignored us.  To be fair, she was making ready the space where we were to sit, but she might have at least acknowledged our presence.  Once she did seat us, she was not apologetic about the wait, and on the way out, she offered no adieu, even though we walked right past her.  Maybe she was having a bad day, but she was a cold welcome at best.  If Saltie educates (or fires) this woman, it will be in five-star land.",4,2/5/2017,Saltie Girl
361,"Food and oysters were very good and well presented. Staff was a bit pretentious. Our server, Michael interrupted our conversation abruptly at least 3 times with meaningless banter. Cocktails were creative and decent but took forever to arrive, plan in advance.",3,2/7/2017,Saltie Girl
362,"I never write Yelp reviews, but this was one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. Came here with a friend at around 7:15 on a Tuesday night. The tables were full when we walked in, but we were able to sit at the bar right away. This place is small, but super cute. From the bar you can see the chefs preparing food throughout the meal.The real star of the show was our server Michael. Michael was incredibly friendly, walked us through the menu, gave us tons of recommendations, and was more than happy to answer any questions we had.We ordered the pineapple drink for two which came in an adorable copper pineapple with copper straws, delicious. For food we started with oysters which were good, but would soon be overshadowed by the even more amazing food that was to follow. After the oysters, Michael brought out the cockle cocktail, which we ordered at his suggestion. The cocktail is served in a torched avocado with truffle oil and sea salt. It had sort of a crab taste, and the flavors blended amazingly. Would definitely recommend this dish.Next we had the snow crab toast which is served with avocado, pistachios, and stracciatella. The flavor of the snow crab was kind of lost underneath all the other flavors, but it was still quite good.Finally we had the fried lobster and waffles, also at Michael's suggestion. I can't say enough good things about this dish. The lobster was fried to perfection and the waffle was light and fluffy. Michael brought us extra sweet corn butter which really added to the flavor and the maple syrup complemented the dish like no other. We came here two days after the New England Patriots came back from a 25 point deficit to win Super Bowl LI, and this dish tasted just as sweet as that victory. 10/10 would recommend.Can't wait to come back and try more dishes off of the extensive menu!",5,2/8/2017,Saltie Girl
363,Great night out for wine and oysters. Had many great laughs and made a couple new friends. Had to call a uber after the last glass of wine hit me...lol,5,2/8/2017,Saltie Girl
364,Fun atmosphere. The service was great.  Food was good.  They had a good collection of drinks.  The space is tiny so the wait is difficult to gauge. We waited longer than expected. The staff was so apologetic that we were happy to wait. Overall good.,4,2/8/2017,Saltie Girl
365,This place is awesome !! I went for lunch with my wife.The food are clean and fresh! Everybody are very nice and super clean ! Oysters  are delicious everything look beautiful ! If I will leave it will definitely my favorite place!,5,2/11/2017,Saltie Girl
366,"Nothing but amazing things to say about this place! Read on Yelp about the no reservation policy but decided our luck anyways on a snowy Saturday night. We put our name in for counter seating around 8:30, and headed next door for some cocktails and a light app while we waited, as the hostess assured us it would be worth it!About 45 minutes- an hour later (after being quoted 1 1/2 hours wait), we were in! Our server was very knowledgable of the menu and we followed just about every recommendation he had. An agave refreshing cocktail (that we ordered 2 more of, it was that good), the cockle avocado dish and fried lobster. Highlight of the night was stealing my dates salmon belly on seared avocado; a sentence this self-proclaimed salmon hater never thought I would say! Honestly could not believe the amazing flavors of this meal. Ordered some crusty bread on the side that was perfect for soaking up every last bit of deliciousness.Awesome, unique approach to seafood. Can't wait to return!!",5,2/12/2017,Saltie Girl
367,"We loved Saltie Girl! As they don't take reservations, my advice is to come very early in the evening. The waiter who greeted us was tremendous and make our night that much more fun. The anchovies in olive oil were out of this world, as was the horseradish sauce that came with our oysters. The Apricot cocktail was my favorite, and I highly recommend their take on a ""surf & turf"" burger as well. Overall, outstanding -- we will be back!",5,2/13/2017,Saltie Girl
368,"Ordered:Fried Lobster with waffles with corn butter and syrup: 5/5 so unique and so delicious!!!! You have to try.The lobster roll: one of the best lobster rolls I have tried in Massachusetts. I am not a fan of cold lobster rolls & this one was warm! Perfect for my liking!The crab avocado toast was ok. Kind of bland. My friends and I were looking for some Sriracha or pepperThe cheese platter was not my favorite either. It was too ""strong"" for my liking. One of them didn't really taste like anything.The pineapple cocktail was very good. Nice display & tasted very good.",4,2/14/2017,Saltie Girl
369,"Small place that is great for brunch or dates. Good seafood selection, with interesting variety (recommend the lobster and waffles for brunch). Extensive drink selection as well. Great, cozy ambiance with friendly servers.",5,2/15/2017,Saltie Girl
370,Although the 'quiet' gentleman preparing my food didn't give me the warm fuzzies....I did enjoy myself (food) and the wine.  I received great guidance from the bartender on a wine choice. I recommend trying the Salmon Belly Crudo.  YUM!,5,2/17/2017,Saltie Girl
371,"My friends and I visited Saltie Girl for weekday lunch recently, and we ate like we were residents of Comm Ave Mall. Sometimes, ya gotta treat yo'self, plus, we were celebrating a friend who was starting a new job.I LOVED the mermaid theme and decor - iridescent turquoise fish scale tiles, framed beachy photo/art prints, pillars wrapped in sailor rope, etc. - instantly turned on my summer mode even though it was February. I have to mention though: the booth seating was pretty uncomfortable and difficult to get into - I literally had to hop up. I'm also 5'2, but not cool.For food, the three of us shared the following:1. RAW OYSTERS2. SNOW CRAB avo toast3. LOBSTER & waffle4. STEAK TARTARE5. SALMON BELLY crudo with cucumber & avo6. FOIE GRAS & PORK BELLY BLTEverything was incredibly tasty and high quality. I will nitpick that I did find a couple tiny shell pieces in both the snow crab and oysters, eeks. Didn't get to try any of the highly-recommended tinned fish (selection was as long as a steakhouse wine list btw); I just couldn't help but think of canned tuna...oh well, maybe next time? We paired our food with refreshing grapefruit cocktails, but I got my eyes on you... pineapple cocktail (for two)! *must bring bae next time*Service was fine for the most part. Our server mistakenly changed my gratuity amount. As soon as I noticed it on my cc statement, I contacted management and it was corrected immediately.",4,2/21/2017,Saltie Girl
372,"Be warned - this place will take your money because everything is so. Dang. Good. We were skeptical of the tin canned seafood, but at Cristiano the bartender's rec we decided on mussels. Definitely worth it; it came with bread, paquillo pepper jam (some good stuff), sweet butter and different salts. Next was the hot lobster roll, which was probably the best I've had. Perfect amount of butter, bun was toasted just right, lobster was in giant chunks. Last we got (again, Cristiano's idea) the tuna carpaccio, which was so packed full of flavor but not overwhelming.Also had a bloody mary, which was spiced just right and topped with an oyster. Cristiano def knew what he was recommending, the staff was nice and personable, and it was a good atmosphere. Downfall was the 45 min wait, but we stepped across the street to grab drinks and they gave us a call when our table was ready. Pricey but everything is delicious and I'd fosho come back for the rest of the menu!",5,2/22/2017,Saltie Girl
373,"I visited the Saltie Girl at around 12 on a Saturday with my boyfriend and even though it was pretty busy, we were seated immediately at the bar. Our server behind the bar was very helpful in recommending us dishes and the specials for the day. In the end we decided to order half a dozen of assorted oysters, the New York Style smoked Atlantic Salmon and the cobia special of the day. After ordering, our dishes came out fairly quickly starting with the oysters. Because we were seated by the bar, it was really cool to see them prepare some the dishes in front of us. The portions were small but since I don't eat a lot, I was content with what I ordered. If you have a bigger appetite, be prepared to order way more than we did! Nonetheless, I was super happy with what I ordered. The oysters were probably the freshest I've ever had and the smoked salmon was so good (coming from a New Yorker!). The only downside to the place was the fact that the dishes were pretty expensive while the portions were small. Be prepared to spend a ton here because the food is so good. Also, the servers tended to be distracted once it got busy- which was around the time we left (around 1:30). I didn't mind but I can see how someone could get frustrated by that. All in all, a really great place to go for weekend brunch. The dishes are super fresh and presented beautifully. I can't wait for my next trip to Boston so I can come here again.",4,2/26/2017,Saltie Girl
374,I had amazing seafood and a great tequila cocktail.  The oysters were fresh and the torched salmon to die for! I will definitely come back next time I'm in Boston,5,3/1/2017,Saltie Girl
375,My favorite dish is definitely their steak tar tar! One of the best I've had around town. Everything was so fresh and good. Tiny restaurant. No reservation. Could be a long wait.,5,3/2/2017,Saltie Girl
376,"We went here for a celebratory lunch (and because it's completely packed for dinner) and ended up nabbing a spot at the end of the bar. This was awesome because we were able to watch the raw bar chef creating everything. First, apologize to your wallet because everything here is small and expensive. But, the food was excellent. We had some wonderful oysters, the brussel sprout side was just ok (too greasy, too few sprouts), and the fried lobster and waffles was to die for. If you have never had fried lobster go RIGHT NOW. It came on a waffle with corn butter (a little too salty) and a spicy maple syrup. We split the dish and it still felt really rich. Not sure if someone could handle the whole thing on their own if they aren't planning a coma later.",4,3/2/2017,Saltie Girl
377,"The place to go for oysters and fresh seafood in Back Bay. But, be warned it is not cheap and you will walk away with a hefty bill. It's also a small space, so be prepared to wait.",4,3/7/2017,Saltie Girl
378,"Loved it and will absolutely be going back. I had the burger, fried oysters and brussel sprouts. All were fantastic! Service was great as well.",5,3/10/2017,Saltie Girl
379,"Excellent service, intriguing, tasty, and well-executed eats and charming décor. I highly recommend for a unique seafood experience.",5,3/12/2017,Saltie Girl
380,"Saltie Girl, there is nothing salty about you. In fact, you are quite the opposite and bring smiles all around after having quite the pleasant lunch here. This is a very cozy smaller restaurant with few seats, I don't recommend bringing a group of more than 4, and from what I hear, they don't take reservations.  The hardest part about coming here is figuring out what to order because you literally want to eat the entire menu.The service is super friendly, we came at lunch and didn't have to wait which was a plus.Drinks: One word. Incredible. My mom got a tequila based drink which was refreshing and phenomenal (the Agave) and I guzzled down something with Grapefruit, so amazing.Appetizers:  We started out with the torched salmon belly, probably one of the best things I hvae put in my mouth, the description doesn't do the taste justice.  Sweet, creamy, flavorful and crunchy, this is THE best thing ever, and I would order this any and everyday.  The Boston Lettuce Salad was delicious, crispy and perfect to split between two people, I loved the ingredients and simplicity here.Lunch:  We split a massive hot lobster roll which poured out large hot chunks of lobster meat on a buttered roll, mmm. The french fries were incredible too, we paid extra to substitute this for the chips, strongly reccomend ordering these.",5,3/14/2017,Saltie Girl
381,This place is great. Stopped in for a late afternoon drink and some apps and sat at the bar closest to the windows. Great atmosphere and menu. We ordered a bunch of oysters and a few tins that the bartender recommended. Everything was awesome. Our new favorite place.,5,3/15/2017,Saltie Girl
382,Everything was great except the two hour wait.. it's a small place so the wait made sense but it requires some patience. The Oysters were delicious and the lobster and waffles was such a treat! The agave cocktail is delicious and so is the rising tide Pisces seawater beer. Everything else on the menu looked great- interested in going again to try some more items. The service was also excellent! Our server was Michael and he was friendly attentive and knowledgeable of the menu options.,5,3/19/2017,Saltie Girl
383,"Tuna carpaccio,  clams, mussels in tin, beef tartare. All excellent including the wine. All top marks. Staff are experts and very nice and smart.  One of the best places I've been to.",5,3/22/2017,Saltie Girl
384,"Great food, better service! Had some amazing tins, love all of the recommendations our server gave us. Lobster roll was a little pricey but very buttery and delicious. Torched salmon was underwhelming. The crab toast was heavenly as were the house made chips and dip with caviar. Best to go with at least four people so you can try some tins and some dishes.",5,3/22/2017,Saltie Girl
385,"I bookmarked this before heading to Boston but we weren't able to try it until our last night in town. I wish I had come here my first night. If I had, I wouldn't have eaten anywhere else during my entire trip however. Everything was perfect from start to finish! I had bookmarked it as an expensive date night vibe and the reviews that led me to that were spot on.We were greeted and told the wait time. They jotted down my number and we headed back outside and wandered Newbury street. Right around the quoted time I received a call from the restaurant letting us know there was a spot open for us! When we returned we were shown two options - one was a booth further back into the small restaurant and the other was two stools at the bar front and center. I love watching restaurants in action (and people watching out the window) so we opted for the bar seats. To save space the stools are on a hinge so you pull them out to be seated and they tuck back under the bar when not in use. Way too much fun for me. I spent a fair portion of the night sliding the stool back and forth and making my wife take Boomerang videos of me. haha.  Now... to the menu.When I read the reviews online my heart was set on a classic lobster roll. Then I began to look over the menu in person and started to entertain a few more candidates. I have since forgotten the names of the amazing waiters and hate that I forgot. Our server was a slender, younger man with clean cut brown hair. An older man also helped with suggestions and food delivery. He was older, slender as well with circular framed glasses. They were super friendly and asked about the reason for our trip while we looked over the menu. The older man suggested the lobster and waffle to me. He told me the sweet corn butter was incredible and he couldn't describe it any better than a must try. He sold me. I went for it. The wifey couldn't be swayed from the traditional cold lobster roll. I was pretty hungry so we wanted an extra bite. I ordered the clam stuffies. I wasn't too sure what I got myself into but when they arrived I wish we had ordered two orders. One was simply not enough. The cheese and clam mixed with the rich pork belly and black truffle was divine. There is no price too high to pay for this. Hand them your credit card and keep em' coming.Then my lobster and waffle arrived. I was worried about the syrup since it is described as spicy. I can't handle any heat and I never felt like there was a hint of heat to be concerned with. The syrup was good but not really needed. The corn butter was melted all over the waffle and was all that was needed for each bite. The breading on the lobster was flavorful but still allowed the lobster and the waffle to shine.My eyes were bigger than my stomach so when I saw their bread and butter delivered to another table I ordered some for us. The bread was wonderful but I could bathe in their butter. Seriously... whatever type of butter they make for all of their dishes - sea salt butter, corn butter - it's all amazing!This was hands down the best meal I had in Boston. The service was top notch - super friendly and chatting and laughing with us when they weren't busy with their tables. I wish I could remember their names because you should ask for one of them to serve you! They made the experience even better!Do yourself a favor and come here for some food. Be patient about the wait as it is a small place. It gives you time to wander and window shop while you wait for a table.",5,3/26/2017,Saltie Girl
386,"This restaurant really surprised me. I wished we ate here earlier during my trip because I would have definitely come more than once. We ordered their fried oysters, clam chowder, Brussel sprouts and 3 oysters (I forgot which ones) What really surprised me was their fried oysters dish. I loved loved loved their fried oysters. I have NEVER tried them the way saltie girl makes them. They serve it on a oyster shell with cole slaw. At first I was hesitant to try it because I don't like cole slaw, but this place makes it really good and it pairs well with the oysters. The batter they fry the oysters with is so light which I love (almost like tempura) because it doesn't overpower the oyster. They cook it so well that once you take a bite the oyster is still warm and juicy! ITS AMAZING!! The clam chowder was okay.. Not as great as I had hoped for. The restaurant is really small, so the wait to be seated can take long. Service was great! The guy who took our order was very detailed on describing the different oysters they offered. We sat by the bar and I thought it was really cool watching one of the workers putting orders together. Some presentations are really cool! Especially when they make cocktails. Great restaurant! Wish it was a little bigger, but I'd definitely come back if I were to visit Boston again!",5,3/29/2017,Saltie Girl
387,Actually one of my favorite meals in boston. The Foie Gras BLT and the burger is a must have. Although the wait could be long it is really worth the wait. The cocktails are also amazing and not too sweet. It is also very moderately priced for what it is.,5,4/5/2017,Saltie Girl
388,"Great atmosphere, great people, great drinks, great food. I stopped in here after a craving for seafood and drinks on the recommendation of good reviews. I was not disappointed. Still not disappointed. Saltie Girl's small, intimate setting is welcoming and warming, especially in cold weather. The bar menu is simple and doesn't require you to memorize ""embarrassing to say out loud"" or ""too complicated to remember"" cocktail names. The fish tins sound like a weird and unusual item to focus on, but they are so much fun. Like the scene from Forest Gump, you never know what you're gonna get. When I ordered the eel tin I assumed I would get some fat, adult sardine-looking eels, but I got little, noodle-like babies that were amazing.It's first come first serve when it comes to the bar and tables, so arrive early and prepare to spend a while.",5,4/5/2017,Saltie Girl

390,"I was a big fan of Neptune when I was working near the North End but it's nearly impossible to get a seat there on weekends. Saltie girl is a rescue. It stands the highest quality in seafood like Neptune but with more creativity. We went on a Wednesday during lunch time and we were able to get a seat. The space is small so it might be hard to get a seat during busy time. We had oysters and sea urchin, and hot lobster rolls. They were very good. They also have a full bar so I could imagine it being a great drinking spot too!",5,4/14/2017,Saltie Girl
391,We really enjoyed the experience! So much fun. Friendly atmosphere and cute decor. We left bed the salmon belly. Be sure to order bread and butter. A real good addition for $4.,5,4/15/2017,Saltie Girl
392,Avoid at all costs. Lobster and waffles for 36$ is 1/8 of a lobster on top of a waffle that tastes like non stick spray. The halibut was dry and flavoreless. And the pineapple drink its like straight upPineapple juice. The only good thing was the fried calamari.,2,4/16/2017,Saltie Girl
393,"Super small, ~10 table tops with a bar, seafood depot of sorts, no reservations available. With all of that in mind, we dined on a rainy weekday for lunch, so there was no wait. The staff is hit or miss. Our waiter was pleasant but the other staff isn't readily available and eager to jump to customer's requests. Putting that to the side, the food was scrumptious and very fresh. We started with a half dozen of oysters - loved the presentation - two droppers 1) hot sauce and 2) mignonette + horse radish & cocktail sauce. One of our oysters was tiny, so our waiter was gracious and brought us another oyster w/o us even asking.Toasted gnocci + caviar - the gnocci was a little salty but they were soft pillows with a nice exterior crisp. They were on top of a light white sauce of maybe creme fresh or sour cream (?). The caviar was light and added further savoriness and decadence to the dish.Snow crab toast - sweet lump pieces of snow crab on top of avocado / pistachios / stracciatella spread evenly across a crusty piece of toast cut in half. The combo was refreshing and light; a nice starter but not very substantial.Saving the best for last - Mussels - wow, where to begin...the broth is super charged with the essence of the mussel juices, garlic, white wine, bacon and finished with butter to give it a silky finish. The mussels were large, plump and drenched in the flavorful broth. A play on the standard chips/fries, the potatoes were fried match sticks on top of the mussels, so they retained their crispiness. I would have loved to get a couple pieces of toast to further indulge in the broth but the dish didn't come with any bread and we didn't as for it either.All in all, a delightful seafood extravaganza worth trying for lunch or an off weather day to beat the crowds.",4,4/16/2017,Saltie Girl
394,"I give this establishment a hard 4. The restaurant is pretty small but has a great location-located in the heart of the Back Bay. The decor is beautiful. Fish scale tiling and a gorgeous bar that even bar haters would want to sit at. The rest of the restaurant consists of big long booths. We ordered: 1.) Torched Salmon Belly (5 stars) - Must order item. The salmon is fresh and melts in your mouth. And the chef's knife skills are really displayed with the beautiful cucumber garnish. 2.) Garlic Clams Toast (4 stars) -This could have been a 5 star if the toast wasn't so impossible to eat. Every time we tried to take bites, the toppings went everywhere. 3.) Tin: In Squid Ink La Bruja (4 stars) - We really wanted to order a tin dish since this is what Saltie Girl advertises as their speciality! The tin came with a spread of sea salt and pepper along with bread, peppers and buttery butter. The squid itself was good but nothing to go back for. 4.) Pineapple drink (5 stars)- Another must order item, especially if you are on a date. The juice is fresh and comes in a stunning presentation. The service was good. I'm weary of servers that try to force you to order dishes (especially the more pricey items) which is exactly what I felt our server was doing. He was very friendly though which made up for it. All in all I would recommend coming here at least once. I probably won't return back to this establishment unless they drop their prices or produce more innovative dishes to match their prices.",4,4/20/2017,Saltie Girl
395,"When I heard there was a restaurant titled ""Saltie Girl"" I wanted to go ASAP. It's a clever name for a seafood restaurant, and yes, I've been salty about things before so why not? Hahaha. My friend and I arrived on a Wednesday with high hopes and hungry stomachs. For starters, we ordered 6 oysters from their menu. They were good and came with three different condiments in cute little bottles. The oysters were fresh and pretty good in my opinion. Next, we had the torched salmon belly. When it came, it looked kind of sad. It seemed like there was too much green on top of the salmon belly. BUT. I was pleasantly surprised. The salmon belly is accompanied with torched avocado and lightly dressed cucumbers on top. It worked well together and almost tasted like a salmon roll without the rice and seaweed. I enjoyed this particular dish.Our server recommended the snow crab toast. Another tasty thing. It also had avocado but it had pistachios which added a great nutty flavor to it. However, I thought it was missing something, though. I would have liked a kick to it. Our server also recommended the lobster roll. He claimed it was ""the best lobster roll in town."" We had it with hot butter sauce. Let me tell you, the lobster was SO TOUGH TO CHEW. WE COULD BARELY SWALLOW IT. Every time I bit into it, I HAD TO PULL the lobster because it kept coming out of the bread because it was just SO TOUGH TO BREAK OFF. For the best lobster roll in town, shouldn't it be easy to eat and at least east to chew? Disappointed. The bread was great and the chips had a nice sweet, sour taste to them. They gave huge chunks of lobster but what was the point if I couldn't fully enjoy it????? I had such high hopes for the roll. It was hyped up so much. Overall, I think the lobster roll really dropped this review a star lower. I liked everything else but I just couldn't bring myself to give four stars after the hard-to-chew lobster. Come on, that was so depressing. I guess instead, if you really want a good lobster roll, walk down a couple blocks and get something at Luke's Lobster instead.",3,4/21/2017,Saltie Girl
396,"The restaurant had an hour and a half wait and refused to seat us until the whole party was there. The place is tiny and we had a group of 6 but they squeezed us into a booth for 4 people. It was uncomfortable, and the waiter gave us a lot of sass the whole meal, complained about his day and about other tables currently dining, and was sick. He kept coughing and touching things on our table, and eavesdropped on our conversation and inserted himself with anothet snide remark. When we paid the bill, he asked us to promptly leave so they could seat other people. I understand the place is small and busy, but the wait staff had been quite rude throughout the whole night. My food was tasty, but nothing special. I had the tartare and split a lobster roll with my friend. Both were tasty, but overpriced. The decor was pretty and mermaid themed.",3,4/24/2017,Saltie Girl
397,"I had to carefully time my visit to saltie girl since they're pretty small and don't take reservations. I arrived at 4:30 on a Saturday evening and the wait was already 45 minutes! Which was fine because you can walk around and they will call you when your table is ready. In this area, there are plenty of things to do while you wait.The highlight of my visit was probably my waiter. I didn't get his name but he was super friendly and informative. It's nice to meet waiters like him who enjoy what they do. As for food, I ordered..Garlic clam toast: pretty good. Lots of toppings on this and very flavorful.Toasted salmon belly: very tender! Comes with sliced avocado and diced cucumbers. Great dish!Canned squid in squid ink: this was good but I'm not super into the canned food. Felt like I could buy this and make it at home.Saltie girl burger: good high end burger! Comes with pork belly, avocado, and fried lobster. The lobster however, is just one small piece placed on top of your burger.The food here is really good but you have to plan your visit carefully since they're small and don't take reservations.",4,4/25/2017,Saltie Girl
398,"Stopped by for lunch and enjoyed the Snow Crab Toast, super fresh oysters, and tasty cocktails. I passed on the escargot, it was too heavy and oily. The place is small and intimate. Loved the decor. Service was excellent and everybody was very welcoming.",4,4/25/2017,Saltie Girl
399,"Consistency and creativity unbounded. The tastes concocted at this small spot pack a sizable punch. Namely the steak with its truffled aioli and quail egg leaves you frazzled as to how you had not known the name sooner. Although some dishes lack in being able to come together, they are made up for with rapture inducing and palette enticing dishes",5,4/26/2017,Saltie Girl
400,"I love this place already! Retro (yet modern) place to grab breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Looks like a diner inside. The coffee is very good! Tons of breakfast & brunch choices. They even stay open late-night on weekends. I'm so excited to have this place in the Tri-Hood area: Back Bay, South End, Bay Village. I ordered the French toast. My boyfriend got the Costa Rican breakfast. They serve beer, wine, cocktails, breakfast mimosas...the whole gamut. Food & service are outstanding. Fun vibe!!",5,1/17/2016,The Friendly Toast
401,We loved this place! Long wait on weekends. The tofu scramble was regrettable but Kate's pancakes were very good. The chicken and waffles were delicious with the gravy.,4,1/17/2016,The Friendly Toast
402,"This is one of the best brunch places in Boston. The staff is very laid back and friendly, as advertised.The comfort food is unforgettable...Huge portions for carbo loading.You could easily take half home for brunch take out at home the next day.THE DEAL: download the no wait app to get in line up to an hour before you arrive. Yes, you may need to wait that long on the weekends. But, if you get in line using the app, you can wait in line at home!",5,1/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
403,"Went there tonight with a friend.  We'd been to the Kendall Square location several times we had high hopes for this location and it did not disappoint.  We started off ordering from the tea menu which was perfect on a cold night, i had a coconut flavor.I ordered the taco party with coconut shrimp which was yummy, spicy, and flavorful.  My friend loved her apple pancakes.The staff there seems really excited about working there so you could feel their positive energy.They also have a lounge on the bottom floor which I look forward to checking out next time.",5,1/20/2016,The Friendly Toast
404,The Sunday brunch was fantastic! We went with friends around 2:00 PM. We all enjoyed various dishes but not one of us had anything negative to say. I had the biscuits and gravy and my husband had the 'Ole Miss'. We also had a few cocktails which were quite inventive and very tasty. I would highly recommend the Friendly Toast for brunch-or any time for that matter. Enjoy!,5,1/27/2016,The Friendly Toast
405,"After taking the train to Boston from DC I walked one block from the Back Bay station and found this gem. It's only been open 2 1/2 weeks but already it's packing people in. They have a great menu with dishes you don't see everywhere else and serve breakfast/brunch dishes all day. Service was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is fun and relaxed. I highly recommend  the Ole Miss - cayenne/cheddar toast topped with sausage, mashed chipotle sweet potatoes, 2 scrambled eggs and mango sour cream. Awesome!",5,1/29/2016,The Friendly Toast
406,"We ordered am avacado burger, The Pit burger, and chicken and waffles.  The Pit was juicy and the sweet potatoe fries was a little too sweet for us.",4,1/30/2016,The Friendly Toast
407,"We got there at 9:30 on Sunday morning just as it was getting busy. The bar had filled up shortly after.  They're still working out some kinks with timing and such since it's fairly new, but I don't fault them for that.The king pancakes with the banana and chocolate chips were amazing.  They call them mini pancakes but they're still pretty large, taking up most of the plate, not to mention the bacon and whipped cream on top.  The bacon that I didn't eat quickly enough from the top of the pancakes got a little too soggy.  I tried the real maple syrup and while the upgrade wasn't cheap ($2), it was more than enough (not a cheap tiny serving like some places give you) and I took the rest home. It comes in a nips bottle.The side of hash browns is generous, they're spiced with cayenne and are a little hot and very good.  The toast was just right with a flaky, almost French bread crustiness. We got a loaf to go so we could have more later.Highly recommend the Bay of Pigs bloody mary, it wasn't spicy or too bacon-y and their mix is very hearty.Would make the trip back next time I'm in town at breakfast time, it makes a tough competitor to my favorite brunch at pour house.",5,1/31/2016,The Friendly Toast
408,"This is my new favorite place. Great, nourishing food (the eggs are served HOT which is amazing and oh that anadama bread!), friendly servers, hilarious 50s retro decor complemented by a cool sound system (Talking Heads *and* Lucinda Williams? Oh yes!). I left a folder there this week, and when I went back and they didn't have it, I despaired. The next morning THEY EMAILED ME to say they'd found it. This is what a neighborhood institution should look like. Long may they work the griddle.",5,2/4/2016,The Friendly Toast
409,"I love the friendly toast, I regularly go to the Kendall square location and have been to the one in Portsmouth NH when I'm visiting I was really pleased to see they've opened in back bay, I live close by and this would mean I can get my weekly fix more easilySo I waited a couple of weeks for the crowds to settle down and eagerly went one Sunday afternoon.Well, I was underwhelmed with the whole experience and disappointed The acoustics were poor and the music was way too loud.  The servers were particularly not friendly not attentive.  I was there on my own and not once did anyone check in and see ""how my meal was"" nor offer more coffee.  The food was just OK. Mine was lukewarm and underwhelming.  In reading the other  reviews, i wonder if we all went to the same place? I hope this is simply a function of the fact that they've ""just opened"" ... I wish I'd gone to Kendall instead. I'll know for next time",2,2/7/2016,The Friendly Toast
410,"I'd been to some of the previous Friendly Toast locations and this one was a bit of a disappointment. The mimosa i got was awful and considering how hard it is to screw up a mimosa, that's pretty bad. The omelette was decent and the hash browns had an OK flavor but they were bone dry.",3,2/11/2016,The Friendly Toast
411,"This is the best waffle in all of New England, if not the entire East Coast!  The cheese fries are made with cheddar and Danish Blue and come with a raspberry dipping sauce.  Mind. Blown. While my son had hot chocolate and the Belgian waffle (with their own homemade maple syrup from NH), I opted for the fish taco and a spiced lager. Yum!Hip vibe, great service!  Will return when I come back to Boston!",5,2/12/2016,The Friendly Toast
412,Delicious food and attentive staff. Cozier/smaller than the Kendall Square location which I also love. I can't remember exactly what I got but I know it was one of their special omelettes that had asparagus in it. This place is great!,5,2/12/2016,The Friendly Toast
413,"The food is really good (I had coconut shrimp tacos and fries, and we all shared nachos) and they have a decent beer list. The service is really what made our experience weird:- Our server came over to introduce herself and goes, ""Hey, I'm Jen... Or Jennifer. Sorry! I'm so weird about introducing myself!"" ...okay.- I asked if they could do one of the regular burger options but with a veggie patty (totally normal request) and our server goes, ""you mean a veggie patty on the burger too?"" I tried to explain what I meant but she got SO flustered. I just ordered something else.- When we were trying to pay the check, she was sitting at the bar with her friends.So like, great diner food. Just weird vibes.",3,2/13/2016,The Friendly Toast
414,"Had the Bay of Pigs and Kendall Square cocktails, with the Mexican Mashed and Guy Scramble.The food and drinks were absolutely superb, the decor was entertaining, and the staff were generally very pleasant.Had to wait for an hour and a half (Saturday at noon) and there was a mixup with the texting system, but otherwise it was all great.",4,2/13/2016,The Friendly Toast
415,"Smaller than the Kendall Square location and still facing challenges.  The front windows need shades to cut the glare and the kitchen seemed challenged to deliver hot food.  Our waitress was great, the only bright spot!",1,2/14/2016,The Friendly Toast
416,"Came here for brunch with a friend today. This place in my opinion is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars but since they played the Misfits the entire time I was in there I am going with the 4. There was a 20 minute wait so we put our name in. I have gone to the Friendly Toast in Kendall Square many times before. This Friendly Toast is almost identical except in a lot easier of a location to get to for me. Food, service, and atmosphere are exactly what I was expecting. Our server was prompt and nice. Atmosphere is kitschy and fun just like the other location. Food is nothing to write home about but very filling. I got the huevos rancheros which comes on anadama bread instead of tortillas and my friend got the ole miss. Mine was a tiny bit cold but it didn't ruin it. All and all its a great diner vibe and a fun place to catch up with friends. There is also a full bar downstairs that maybe I will check out if I come back at night time.",4,2/15/2016,The Friendly Toast
417,Went here this past week with some co-workers. A new location opened up in Back Bay on Stanophe right next to Flour. The place was packed when we walked in but we had called ahead and had a table reserved for us. You can order breakfast all hours of the day and it is open until 3am. I opted for the chicken and waffles at lunchtime. Was very good quality food. Only knock on the place is that it is very crammed you are in some cases depending on your seat on top of the people next to you. Also one of my co-workers orders took a very long time to come out they gave us a free appetizer and took his meal off the bill. Service like that certainly doesn't go unnoticed will definitely be back once all the hype dies down and there are more normal crowds,5,2/16/2016,The Friendly Toast
418,"Came here as an alternate to elsewhere that was too packed. I'm glad we did, they are helpful and proactive  (manager stopped by) (thank you). The food was amazing, service outstanding! Great work! On a Thursday!",5,2/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
419,"Why I'll go back:  A broad menu with reasonable prices in a laid back atmosphereYou HAVE to order:  the home friesTony's Tip:  The NoWait app is invaluable on the weekendThis place is a solid 4.  It's got a diner vibe, suburban prices for a downtown joint, and the food is good enough.  I had the Ole Miss, which is a mess of bread, sausage, scrambled eggs, and a generous layer of (very) sweet mashed potatoes.  Interesting combo, but I wouldn't order it again.  French toast, pancakes, waffle ordered by the rest of the crew were all deemed okay, but not standouts.  The surprise were the home fries.  The presentation is simple (thinly sliced ovals).  But they're the perfect combo of crispy and seasoned that seems like it should be easy to pull off, but often misses the mark when brunching out.  I enjoyed the coffee enough for a couple refills, but I'm not craving it either, ya know?One suggestion for mgmt:  put a horizontal rack of coat hooks on the rear corridor wall so diners can leave them there instead of cramping their space in a booth, especially if it's been raining or snowing out.",4,2/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
420,came here at 1am and waited 25 minutes to order and 40 minutes to get food event though the place wasn't busy. the food was awful - I got a burrito which fell apart when I picked it up. the check only took about 15 minutes to get back to us. absurdly slow service. terrible food. don't come here.,1,2/20/2016,The Friendly Toast
421,Nice selection of brunch and comfort food. We had great service (despite what some other reviews say) and very friendly...hence the name. We came on early side so was not too busy yet but really enjoyed it.,4,2/20/2016,The Friendly Toast
422,"Great family place, bright and colorful. There is even a small playground across the street. Victoria our server was very pleasant and calm on a busy Sunday. Good food, lots of coffee. Good vibe all around!",5,2/21/2016,The Friendly Toast
423,"I can't recommend this restaurant enough!! The food was AMAZING (my mouth is literally watering as I write this because I'm thinking about the biscuits and gravy that I ate) and reasonably priced, too! The staff was incredibly friendly and very accommodating when we asked to move tables because of the bright sunlight. The Friendly Toast is an absolute MUST if you want brunch that will keep you full and happy until dinner time.",5,2/21/2016,The Friendly Toast
424,Has a cute diner-like atmosphere. Went for a late night snack on a Saturday- drinks were good but pricey ($13 for a cocktail) but the food was tasty. I had the veggie quesadilla- it had cheese vegetables and vegetarian sausage. They had a large selection of breakfast and non-breakfast items as well as a lot of vegetarian items. will definitely be back to try more!,4,2/21/2016,The Friendly Toast
425,"This place is such a great addition to the area! We were in dire need (in my opinion) of some simple, new breakfast options. It can be tricky to get a table (especially for more than 2) on the weekends for brunch, but the bars upstairs and downstairs often have open seats.The food is greasy-spoon to die for delicious, and the staff is very friendly and well-informed. Love the funky decor as well.Can't wait to come back late night!",5,2/22/2016,The Friendly Toast
426,Yup - I agree with most of the other reviewers - the food is good but the service is super slow.  Don't got to The Friendly Toast hungry on a weekend or you might be forced to dig to the deepest depths of your purse for that spare mint.I arrived on Sunday for a birthday brunch and was told that I had a hour wait.  I loved that I was able to give my cell phone and that they would send a text when I was ready.  The weather was gorgeous and we were able to wait outside but the hostess stand is super small so I have no clue what they do when the weather is cold/rainy.Once called we were lead back to a crowded but totally kitchy dining area.  I have been to the Portsmouth location (which I believe is the original) and the decor is like it's little sister.  Our water was pleasant and promptly took our order.I ordered an egg which veggie omelette with double toast ( I subbed out the home fries).  Their toast is what I remembered and it was my birthday damn it - so toast it was.  Even though it was busy our meals were brought out BUT what I was presented with was a regular omelette with home fries and the wrong toast.  The water was sincerely apologetic and took my  meal back but I kept the toast to tide me over.  What I got back was a agreeable omelette with an extra slice of toast which was actually a bit cold.I was told that they were only opened for 3 weeks and they definitely have some kinks to work out.  I just hope that  The Friendly Toast remedies these issues and is not relying on the great service and food that patrons remember from the original location,3,2/22/2016,The Friendly Toast
427,Such an awesome place and the food was delicious! They have a great vintage vibe and great staff. It was really peasant to enjoy some eggs Benedict that were delicious! Highly recommend,5,2/23/2016,The Friendly Toast
428,"The New Orleans fries were amazing. I also loved the brunch cocktails, great selection. I will for sure go back for lunch or dinner!",5,2/25/2016,The Friendly Toast
429,"This is my new favorite brunch spot in the back bay area! The decor/ambience is fun, the menu is very large with lots of different options, and the food was excellent! I think the biggest downfall is that they don't do reservations, however, I used that app No Wait and even though I was about 8th in line when I got there, the hostess gave me a table. So I'd suggest either going early for a weekend brunch or using the app, otherwise you'll be waiting forever. Also, to the other comment about the service being slow---I didn't have that trouble at all. Even with the restaurant packed, we got served on time and it wasn't slow at all.",5,2/27/2016,The Friendly Toast
430,"Not ImpressedMy wife and I sat at the upstairs bar seats. Good vibes and a trendy environment. The service was horrible and not once did they ask how our meal was or if we needed anything else. My coffee was never refilled and the water didn't come with ice. I got the Huevos Rancheros and it came out cold. My wife got the Meg's American Burrito and it was basically a pile of warm eggs. The potato / so called home-fires need some spices and could have been heated up.  All in all not impressed with this place which is a bummer because I've had luck at the Portsmouth, NH location. Lastly, I'm about 99.9% I got food poisoning. Was throwing up all night.",1,2/28/2016,The Friendly Toast
431,"Overall opinion: Not as good as the Cambridge location, but shorter wait.I came here at 2pm on a Saturday, it was 15-30 minutes for a table of 2 or sit at the bar. I opted to sit at the bar because it was pretty close to empty. The bartender was nice and attentive. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with the French fries ($12). I liked their use of two different types of cheese (blue + Swiss) instead of ranch sauce. It's good portion, I thought it was small at first but I ended leaving pretty happy and full. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles ($14) + a side of home fries ($3). Here is why I think the Cambridge location is better: the chicken in Cambridge is fried chicken on the bones while the Back Bay is chicken tenders on top of the waffles.I didn't have any issues with service being slow.",3,3/5/2016,The Friendly Toast
432,"Likely less than 20 tables, so expect a wait if you come during prime time but this a an unpretentious hipster kitsche diner with stick to your ribs dishes. The pancakes are always light, fluffy and monster sized, two are $9. The egg in the toast was perfectly cooked with crispy exterior and warm oozy eggy center. The side of hash, $5, was decent but nothing spectacular and served its purpose as the extra protein.",4,3/5/2016,The Friendly Toast
433,"In the Boston area for work, so I was brunching alone on a Saturday afternoon! Came later in the afternoon, around 3 o'clock. Although the restaurant was very full there was no wait for me, and the place was significantly cleared by the time I left a little after 4, so if you're looking to avoid a wait I'd recommend 3-5pm. As a vegetarian I often find myself in situations where I'm forced to choose among just 1-3 items on an otherwise large menu, and often even those are uninspired (e.g. this salad/pasta dish but without protein, or a combo of side dishes, etc.), but not so at all with this one. There were so many interesting vegetarian and vegan options I was overwhelmed (in a good way!) in a way I haven't been in years: housemade veggie burger, grilled cheese served with spicy jam, burrito bowls, tofu bowls, even options for veggie sausage and bacon. Even with all these interesting choices I somehow made a boring choice: an omelette. But damn if it wasn't one of the best omelettes I've ever had. I made my own with veggie sausage, goat cheese, mushrooms, spinach, avocado, and jalapenos. The produce was ridiculously fresh, especially the avocados & jalapenos. It came with a side of toast (I got oatmeal bread, which was magically hearty and soft at the same time) and homefries (basically just sliced potatoes but tasted alright). Highly recommended for vegetarians and vegans everywhere!!!",5,3/5/2016,The Friendly Toast
434,I'm not sure how this establishment has gained 4 stars.  The food we got was below average. The poached salmon to start was a paper thin piece of salmon with two over cooked or what I suspect was pre cooked poached eggs on a slab of think dry bread. I also ordered a bloody which I sent back because it tasted sour the second was better but not by much. I would not waste your time or money here I certainly will not be back.,1,3/12/2016,The Friendly Toast
435,"This place has been the buzz around town as it is fairly new to Back Bay.  I was looking forward to French toast and an overall great breakfast.  Unfortunately, my food was undercooked and rather bland.  After sending back my undercooked eggs and French toast, I decided to order a pancake.  It was thin and crispy--over cooked.  It was dry, and you can probably prepare better food at home.  On a more positive note, the homefries are tasty but no one tells you they are spicy.  The drink list has some variety, and the restaurant stays open late. If I'm desperate and in the area, I could tolerate it.  The major plus here is the service.  The managers are out and about and jump in when servers are struggling.  The Great customer service pushed my one star to two!",2,3/13/2016,The Friendly Toast
436,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon which is probably the worst time to come since everybody is out eating brunch and nursing their hang overs. We had to wait an hour before we were seated. Good thing is you can walk around the Copley area if it's nice and sunny out. Bad thing is that they actually never called us back for our reservation, we had to call them back. We walked back an hour and a half later and basically sat down as if we just arrived - so I'm not quite happy there. They try the make it a very 80s theme which I'm not a fan of, and they serve food diner style. This isn't a place you would want to go to if you have a car, luckily I found a spot right around the corner on a Sunday. Give it a try and judge for yourself - try to Salmon Benedict!",3,3/13/2016,The Friendly Toast
437,"A great place to grab brunch, but they also have lunch and dinner. I came here the morning after St Patrick's day and it was just what I needed. They play music ranging from Weezer to Sinead O'Conner, and John Mellencamp. Menu is expansive and the bar makes great mimosas. We had the Mexican Mashed breakfast and Huevos Rancheros which were perfectly done: avocado was ripe, chorizo and potato were perfectly seasoned. I'll have to come back and let you know how dinner is, either way Friendly Toast is a good stop if you're in Boston.",4,3/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
438,"We decided to try The Friendly Toast Back Bay for Brunch today.  I knew it might be a long wait based on what I heard others say, so we were prepared ... but not for a one and a half hour to two hour wait at noon on a Sunday!  Yikes!  Good thing we had errands to run in the area and came back after about an hour and our table was ready about 15 minutes after that.  NOW, I know to use an app called ""Nowait"" where you can put your name in advance to reduce your wait time if you are going to The Friendly Toast.Anyway, so we sit down (starving) and I quickly decide on the Pumpkin pancakes.  My boyfriend orders the Costa Rican.  However; shortly after we order, the waitress comes back and says she should have informed us earlier that the kitchen has run out of Pumpkin pancakes.  What?  On a Sunday in the middle of the day?  Odd.  But I go ahead and order the Orchard Cakes instead.The food came out pretty promptly; however we were not overwhelmed by the food taste-wise.  My boyfriend said he had hoped the Costa Rican would have some spice/seasoning to it, and instead it was pretty plain.  My Orchard Cakes were good ... but not wait-an-hour-and-a-half good.  Plus, I was still disappointed I couldn't get what I had really come to the restaurant to order: Pumpkin pancakes.The staff is really young -- like all college kids (which is not totally surprising).  One of the owners of The Friendly Toast, as he loudly proclaimed when he walked in the door and obviously expected a table immediately (and a red carpet rolled out), was sitting at the table next to us and was clearly keeping his eye on the staff to see that things are run smoothly.  He might want to check in on the kitchen to see why keeping pumpkin pancake batter is so difficult.  So my consensus is that it is a good place, great to have a restaurant in Back Bay that offers all day breakfast, decent food, and just remember to use the ""Nowait"" App if you go to reduce your wait time.  Oh, and I really hope the restaurant has Pumpkin Pancakes next time we go in.",4,3/20/2016,The Friendly Toast
439,Stopped in during the week for a quick Cheeseburger & Fries at the bar.  Both were delicious.  I will definitely go back.  Love the 60s decor.,3,3/22/2016,The Friendly Toast
440,"Stopped by in the evening, after 8, and it was not crowded at all.  Had some clam chowder and the fish taco, both were very tasty.  The soup was a very small portion but extremely rich, I really did not need any more.  The staff was nice, looked like they were all having fun.  Would definitely return.",4,3/23/2016,The Friendly Toast
441,"Friendly waitstaff, was seated immediately on a Thursday afternoon.  There were a few people ordering to go around me who waited abiut 30 minutes for their orders - they weren't happy but my food came pretty quickly. I ordered the banana pecan waffle, two eggs, & bacon - way too much for me to finish! The waffle tastes great, the eggs and bacon were eggs and bacon - usr to mess this up. I also ordered a minute which tasted pretty good although bid remember the name (something with cranberry and oj I think.  All in all a bit pricey but good flavor for what I ordered",4,3/24/2016,The Friendly Toast
442,"Their Orleans fries are to die for. So far, their avocado burger with balsamic glaze and fired chicken taco party are the best dishes. If you're craving something sweet and hearty go for their french toast. But the orleans fries are the star of the menu. The staff is always friendly and attentive. Breakfast all day! My current favorite place in Boston!",5,3/24/2016,The Friendly Toast
443,We had a great breakfast at The Friendly Toast while visiting Boston. We got there on a Friday morning by 8:30 and were seated right away which is always a plus. I had the Old Miss which was delightful and a nice change of pace from the usual breakfast plate. I can't wait to eat it again on my next visit!,5,3/24/2016,The Friendly Toast
444,"Stopped in for brunch on a beautiful Sunday. 1 hour plus wait for a table but since I was rolling solo, I found a seat at 1 of 2 bars. I had a mimosa and the pulled pork benedict. It's obviously not a classic Benny with the pulled pork, but in addition it's  served with a biscuit in place of the English muffin. Nice touch. The biscuit was superb. My bartender was great, my food was brought out promptly and hot. This was very important as I was crunched for time, had a flight to catch. The decor is awesome and they have a great Playlist going in the downstairs bar/dining area. Would def recommend this place to people traveling in the area and anyone who lives in Boston if I knew them. Plus I love the name, the friendly toast!!! Awesome!!!",4,3/27/2016,The Friendly Toast
445,"Maybe it's because I'm from the south, but the food was terrible. I had the Mexican mash up, which had to have had at least 7 cloves of garlic in it. My throat was singed, I couldn't even finish it. My palette was entirely wrecked and I couldn't taste my coffee after. I got complaints about the smell when I left; had to pick up an Altoids case to dull down the garlic. And I'm married to a Greek!!! I love garlic! But damn! The cheddar Cayenne bread might've been great but I couldn't taste it after. Coffee was good before I ate. I come up to Boston twice a year, so I know they really aren't losing business, but I'll never be back. We sat at the bar and service wasn't really on the ball, but the place was packed so I understood. Just wish I didn't have to wait ten minutes to be able to see the barkeep to ask for a new cup of coffee.",2,3/27/2016,The Friendly Toast
446,Went here twice in a day because it's so close and convenient to my friend's apartment. We went to brunch first and called ahead to see of they took reservations-they don't but told us about an app called NoWait which allowed us to virtually be in line for an hour without actually physically being there. I got the Meg's American Burrito which I regret because it was a little dry and there were other things on the menu I wanted to try. My friends got the biscuits and gravy and chicken and waffles and they were really good when I tried. We also came back at night (no wait)  for a snack since they open pretty late in weekends. We got the tomato soup with grilled cheese. The soup was really salty and the grilled cheese was just meh. Would probably come back for the biscuits and gravy though. Oh also make sure to download their app which is essentially a loyalty card. If you visit 10 times you get $10 off.,4,3/27/2016,The Friendly Toast
447,"My friend and I went Here on Easter and we checked in through the app. Even though we still had an hour left on our wait, it was cut down to 20 minutes we went actually checked in in person.  Our table ordered the Breakfast burrito, the Ole Miss, breakfast tacos and blueberry pancakes. The burrito was pretty good but not outstanding. The breakfast tacos were amazing, definitely recommend! The mango sour cream sauce on the ole miss was delicious and the sweet potato with it has great flavor. All of the portions were a good size too, especially for the priceWe also ordered bloody Mary's and the Kendall Square cocktail. The cocktail was really good and really refreshing Overall I would definitely come here again!!",4,3/28/2016,The Friendly Toast
448,"sort of chaotic decor, service very good, food is good.  crowded, prob more cuz its new than its great.  don't get me wrong, good solid food, just not amazing.  i'd hate to get seated downstairs, its dungeon-like.",3,3/29/2016,The Friendly Toast
449,"I walked here from the Westin hotel while on a business trip. The restaurant is a convenient walk from the hotel. On a Tuesday morning at 7am, the restaurant was practically empty. I was quickly greeted by my waitress, Sam and was provided water without having to ask which was a pleasant surprise. I ordered the New Hampshire's Finest (scrambled eggs, goat cheese, bacon, asparagus). My meal was delivered to my table very quickly! My water was never empty and the food was good. The cinnamon raisin toast was delicious and seriously thick! Why not 5 stars? The potatoes left much to be desired. So much so that I left 80% on the plate. I'd come back if in town again.",4,3/30/2016,The Friendly Toast
450,"FriendlyToast Backbay is a place i will visit very often . Very friendly staff , food is really good. Top floor can get pretty busy and tight during weekday lunch . If you're sitting in the middle of the floor expect waitresses and other guest to walk by pretty frequently. The bottom floor has a chill somewhat loud after work atmosphere on Fridays. Great bartender, seen me a couple of times but already knows what beer I like when i get there. Burrito, Clam Chowder, The Cheeseburger, Salad, The nachos..  so far I've tried and no complaints.",4,3/31/2016,The Friendly Toast
451,"Just what the neighborhood needed.Standard, tasty brunch food. Big portions and great bread. But definitely not worth the 60 min + wait on weekends. If you have that kind of time, I'd go to Paramount down the street.However, downloading the NoWait app is a big time-saver.Tried the huevos rancheros (on homemade adama (sp?) molasses bread and the Ole Miss. Can't go wrong with either!",3,4/4/2016,The Friendly Toast
452,"We were looking for a good breakfast spot for our last day in Boston. I came across this place  on Yelp - it sounded good and it was a short walk from our hotel, so we thought we'd give it a try. As soon as we walked in, I knew we were going to love it. The whole place had a cool retro vibe to it. Our waiter, Joshua was super friendly and very attentive. My daughter had the eggs in a hole (or some name similar to that) and she really loved it. She devoured the home fries and loved that they made the bacon nice and crispy! I had a breakfast burrito - I can't recall the exact name, but it was stuffed with bacon, American cheese, scrambled eggs and those delicious home fries) - Yum!Definitely a breakfast spot worth checking out!",4,4/8/2016,The Friendly Toast
453,This hipster feeling place was the right price and high quality food. For under $20 you can have lobster poached eggs (delicious). Only reason I didn't five star it was because my poached egg was slightly over cooked. Overall great staff and cool breakfast place.,4,4/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
454,"Loved everything about this place. The wait was very long, but using the NoWait app helped us get there closer to when we actual got seated. The staff was extremely kind and friendly. Food was excellent and not too expensive. Decour was funky, and the boom boom lounge downstairs was great place to hangout before getting seated! They even had tea and brownies out for guests waiting to be seated. I recommend the Babe Benny",5,4/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
455,"Came here on a Sunday evening for dinner. The service was slow. The fries were soggy. I had the fish burrito and it wasn't appetizing. I also had the ann marie quesadilla, which tasted like it just came out of the microwave. I won't be coming back here and will tell my friends and family to steer clear.",1,4/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
456,Great spot for brunch. Loved the eclectic decor. It was nice that you could choose what type of bread you wanted for your french toast.,4,4/11/2016,The Friendly Toast
457,Had pre-marathon dinner here.  Great food in combinations I never thought of but they came together perfectly.  Serve breakfast menu all day.  Highly recommend The Best Damn Grilled Cheese sandwich and the pancakes were delicious!,5,4/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
458,"A very small place and tables close to one another. The staff is friendly. We put our order down for three parties and our food arrived in 30 mins. I ordered the Irish Benny, but it wasn't hot, warm. The corn beef hash I think was from the can, I've had better. Maybe next time I'll try something else and hope the food comes out in a proper time and heat.",2,4/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
459,"Bring a pillow because you need a nap until they take your order , and the food was good but average",1,4/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
460,"Great music, good selection beers. Menu was enticing but my bread and eggs were sub par. Potato salad were under cooked and the eggs were over cooked. Place was empty and there was no rush in the kitchen...",3,4/20/2016,The Friendly Toast
461,"A solid 3 stars. I'm not sure if my friend and I ordered the wrong things but she had one of the eggs benedict items and I had the Huevos Rancheros. It was good, but nothing spectacular and/or out of the ordinary. Have definitely had better brunches elsewhere but the service was fine, and the ambiance and restaurant itself was really cute. I went at an off hour, but don't think waiting to eat here for more then 15 minutes is worth it. There are better places for breakfast/brunch",3,4/20/2016,The Friendly Toast
462,"Great place for brunch/breakfast anytime of the day. I highly recommend using the App NoWait which allows you to go ahead and ""put your name down"" without physically being at the restaurant. The interior decor is eclectic and fun. The wait on a Saturday at peak brunch hour (noon) was 1.5 hour for 4 people which was to be expected. The only negative aspect of this place is that it is extremely loud. You have to shout at times to talk to the people at your table. Food:All the food that our table ordered had great portions and most importantly tasted great. My husband made his omelette with turkey bacon and chorizo which he found to be delicious, fluffy , and had great flavor. I had the Ole Miss which consisted of cheddar/cayenne toast with sweet potato, veggie sausage patty, and fluffy egg on top. This portion was quite large and I definitely needed help to finish it. The Ve-Gan tofu scramble was full of flavor with the use of green salsa verde and also extremely well portioned. The Bloody Mary's were full of flavor, spicy, and refreshing. The service was great as well. Overall: I would definitely eat here again. Who doesn't love breakfast?",4,4/23/2016,The Friendly Toast
463,"I've read mixed review's about this place. But considering it's new and right near where my friends are, we decided why not. I wasn't disappointed. I've had the Ole Miss, which was yummy. If you like a little kick, it has that. The sweet potatoes went really well with the whole thing. All the flavors messed very well together. The mexican mashed meal was also good. I mean who doesn't love chorizo! The bloody mary's were quite delicious as well, just the right amount of everything to make it refreshing.  Definitely would go back.",4,4/26/2016,The Friendly Toast
464,"A smaller version of the Kendall location, it's just what you'd expect from its larger location (just much louder, for some reason?). Expect long waits on weekends, but at least they utilize the NoWait app which tells you how many people are ahead of you. I'm a sucker for the all day breakfast and the Omar's Homefries, and their anadama bread is to die for, but have found some of their other breakfasty options to be somewhat hit or miss and not super consistent. Nice draft beer list here though, although they're lacking the boozy milkshakes and coffee concoctions found in Kendall... come to think of it, there are some menu items as well that didn't make it over the river, so if you're a FT virgin, maybe check out that location instead?",3,5/6/2016,The Friendly Toast
465,"Came here for brunch, and really had fun taking in the entire menu- which takes about ten minutes to read through if you are brand new/first timer here. My girlfriend and I settled in on splitting two breakfast dishes:The coconut pancakes, and the omelet that is on top of a savory sweet potato mash, with spicy sausage and some cheese, paired with fresh fruit. The egg dish was a little overcooked, but tons of flavors were packed into that dish. It was fun to eat because it was something new for a breakfast egg item I haven't seen in a while, which was a nice change of pace. Our pancakes were ordered with the real maple syrup option, which seemed to be the only option to even consider for the pancakes.Our server was friendly, but not super attentive. We had two ask twice for things to be brought to the table, which was annoying. The food is not amazing, but the menu selections, decorations, and location are all worth enjoying- the coffee however, I did not enjoy.",4,5/7/2016,The Friendly Toast
466,"This place is amazing. Service is always great, staff is very friendly. And food is always amazing. I eat here sadly more then I should because it's right across the street from work. My favorite is the chicken and waffles it's so good I wish it came with a little bit more because I'm always sad when it's gone and I'm a big guy and like big portions. All there good is delicious and there prices aren't bad for Boston. I strongly suggest this   establishment to everyone! Oh an they serve alcohol all day!!! The portion on the cornbeef hash is very small and mediocre but this place still gets five stars!",5,5/8/2016,The Friendly Toast
467,"while I usually love this place, they really messed up my order the last time. I ordered a burger and side salad and didn't get the burger I ordered or the side salad I ordered. I sent it back and it was still wrong the second time but I felt bad about sending it again. probably shouldn't have paid $17 for not my order.. but otherwise great food, the cheese fries are awesome and it's a cute quirky place. just make sure you're okay with not getting what u ordered!",4,5/8/2016,The Friendly Toast
468,"This place has some pretty great brunch food. As a group of 10, we were able to come in on a Tuesday evening, and were seated immediately. The wait staff was nice and attentive, and they were in the middle of a Trivia night. I had the Irish Benny, which is basically an Eggs Benedict over an english muffin and corned beef hash, with their hash browns.  The hash browns aren't typical hash browns that you'd get at most other breakfast spots, and weren't deep fried or overly greasy. They were still delicious though.  The Eggs were spot on and the hash was great as well. They also have a great selection of beers, bottled and draft. They are also open until 3pm on Fridays and Saturdays, which is most like because of the Brahmin next door. Nothing beats great breakfast food after a club night, except chinese food.This will definitely be a goto spot if I'm in the Area.",4,5/11/2016,The Friendly Toast
469,"Last day in Boston (for a while) so I snuck away for a late breakfast. The place is tucked back on Stanhope street in Back Bay (near the Red Lantern), so it can be tricky to find if you're not a local. It was not crowded, just moderately busy at 9:00 on a Friday morning. Hipster kitsch is certainly the order of the day. Mod 60s diner-style everywhere, but certainly ""modern"" prices. Waitstaff was certainly attentive and friendly, but not hovering or overbearing. I sat at the bar and ordered the breakfast sandwich with eggs scrambled, jalapeño jack cheese, and crispy bacon on an English muffin. It came with home fried potatoes. The potatoes were really good as served, and the sandwich was prepared just right. It wasn't particularly flavorful but a little Sriracha made it just right. If you're in the neighborhood this is a good spot for breakfast. They get the essentials right. Clean place, good atmosphere, friendly staff, good food served quickly, and an easy walk in Back Bay.",4,5/13/2016,The Friendly Toast
470,"My friend,  boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday at noon and the wait time was 1.5 hours. We decided to talk a stroll to Boston Common to kill some time but they texted us about 45 minutes later to inform us our table was ready.  The waitress was friendly and our food came out in a timely manner. I ordered the vegetarian scramble and it was soooo delicious!  My friend,  who is not a vegetarian,  said she couldn't even tell it was made with tofu because it was so good. Boyfriend ordered the coconut pancake and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't recall what my friend ordered but remember she really enjoyed her food as well.  Overall, we had a good experience. I advise going there early to get your name on the list because the wait time can be long.",4,5/14/2016,The Friendly Toast
471,"Today I revisited The Friendly Toast for brunch. It was still a very enjoyable experience! I arrived around 3 PM so there was plenty of seating available since I missed the rush. When I first visited back in February with my friend, we arrived around 11 AM and got caught in the breakfast rush.I ordered Kate's Tofu Scramble, which consisted of vegetarian sausage, tofu, mushrooms, corn, and cheese. It came with a side of home fries and a toast of your choice (I got the cayenne-cheddar). The food was delicious! So much going on in this particular dish- the corn salsa really does the trick. The sausage bits were especially great and might've been the best part! The cayenne-cheddar toast tasted a lot spicier than it did in the Ole Miss (which I ordered during my first visit) so be aware!!The music they played was really jammy!! (Some artists I recognized: The Smiths, The Drums) The service was still not as quick as I thought it'd be, given that we came well after the breakfast rush. The waitress took awhile to bring us our check/take our payment as well, but we weren't too bothered by it. As always, I left with a satisfied tummy and a piece of Bazooka bubble gum, courtesy of The Friendly Toast! Overall, an enjoyable experience yet again!!",4,5/14/2016,The Friendly Toast
472,"The restaurant and the people who serve here are amazing. Just go there and you will have a good time eating and enjoying. We went in as a group of 8 and everyone felt really amazing. The dishes are good and the ambience is awesome. A nice chill and cool place for dinner. I had the grilled chicken sandwich which was pretty good. I had the waffle with fruits and maple syrup, the beef masala , the fish dish and lot of appetizers. Overall experience is good.",4,5/15/2016,The Friendly Toast
473,"Came here at night after being out for drinks at Brahmin next door. Naturally, after having a couple too many gin and tonics, I ordered a bacon cheese burger with sweet potatoes fries. My friend ordered a chicken club sandwich. Our food was DELICIOUS!! And I'm not just saying that because I was drunk. Also my friends club sandwich was humungous. My burger and fries were in generous portions as well!! The service was so friendly and the music was fantastic. I love the vibe at this friendly toast spot. I will definitely be back!!",5,5/16/2016,The Friendly Toast

475,"The Friendly Toast has answered by dreams by opening up in Back Bay! Now, I know the ~brunch crowd~ is usually of a certain mindset. But Friendly Toast is a place where one and all can come at any time of day or night to get that hearty, huge-portioned plate of diner food. Mounds of bacon, pancakes the size of platters and omelettes galore, Friendly Toast has you set for breakfast at any hour. Or, if you're feeling savory, try their melts, biscuits and gravy or burgers. Eclectic decor (legit, super weird), hipster, tatted servers and two levels of seating make Friendly Toast unlike a lot of other places in Back Bay, or heck, Boston in general. The price is right, the portions are right and the food is good. 5 stars for Friendly Toast! Reservations are accepted only on their app.",5,5/20/2016,The Friendly Toast

Was told we were not able to sit outside because it was supposed to rain. (It was a beautiful day out!!!) So, we sat down I got a mimosa and my bf got a blood Mary. He looked at me when he got it and said ""too light."" My mimosa was pretty standard. I got the breakfast burrito and my bf got French toast on cinnamon raisin bread. Overall food was good! Best part about the breakfast was the atmosphere and decor of the place. Would suggest calling ahead or downloading the app we were told about, to save you a mindless, famished  stroll around back bay.",3,5/22/2016,The Friendly Toast
478,"My first meal in Boston was at The Friendly Toast and it was a great welcome to the city! This spot has excellent service, a unique and diverse menu, and most important great food. To kick off the trip I had no other choice to start with a Bloody Mary and The Friendly Toast's version is definitely up to par. My fiance was definitely pleased with the draft beer selection as well.If you've ready any of my reviews you know I don't do eggs so I was glad to see this spot had some exciting dishes that could be enjoyed sans eggs. I was determined to try something featuring their homemade Cayenne Cheddar bread and the Ole Miss ended up being the perfect choice. It was just the right amount of sweet and savory although if I had it again I'd have them go easier on the mashed sweet potatoes. My fiance was equally happy with his Taco After Party (he added chorizo).This place was full of cute touches including postcards with your check, a waiter very helpful to a couple of tourists, and eclectic furniture that welcomes you in.",4,5/23/2016,The Friendly Toast
479,"Quaint little breakfast with good food and homemade breads. The wait was almost an hour when we arrived, but there was no wait to sit outside, which is what we did. They have great menu selection, but they are slightly more expensive than other breakfast locations (although you get a lot of food for what you are paying). The reason I am not giving them 4 or 5 stars is the service is terribly slow. Super friendly, just really, really slow. The wait to get a table would probably be a lot shorter if the service was a little quicker.",3,5/31/2016,The Friendly Toast
480,"I love the friendly toast! They have amazing and interesting food, the service is relaxed and attentive, and the drinks are creative. My boyfriend and I went here recently on a date and both came away completely stuffed! There are a few drawbacks though and it isn't a place that we'll become regulars at.Positives:- cool, fun decor-servers are nice and personable- really interesting menu with constantly changing specials- food is SUPER filling- drinks are creative and fun Negatives:- its loud in there!- super crowded, getting to the bathroom is like walking through a maze- host staff aren't very friendly and they quoted us an hour long wait when there were multiple empty tables and free seats at the bar- $4 for a regular every day cup of coffee",3,5/31/2016,The Friendly Toast
481,"Stopped on Memorial Day to grab brunch with a friend and were greeted by an hour wait. Kind of a bummer but to be expected, luckily we were able to grab two seats at the bar downstairs and skipped the wait. Compared to the Kendall location this has a much cozier feel as they have both the upstairs and downstairs which are much smaller spaces. It still has the fun retro ambiance of the other locations which is enjoyable.The food here is always decent. I can't say it's brunch food that will blow you away, it's just average quality but the menu is large and they have some interesting dishes. I ordered a make your own scramble and it was just okay. I had avocado as one of my ad-ins and instead of having nice chunks of fresh avocado it was all mashed up in the scrambled eggs which not only looked disgusting but was not too pleasing to the palette. Luckily the meal came with plentiful homefries and some nice pieces of toast so it wasn't a total lost cause.My main problem with the meal was our bartender/waitress who was very rude and generally not hospitable. Didn't really greet us, wasn't generally friendly or helpful (when asked if i wanted an omelette or ""scramble"" I asked what a scramble was-I wasn't sure if it was hash or scrambled eggs etc and she responded ""what does it sound like??""). I also stated I am dairy free and asked a few questions in accordance with that about the menu and it seemed to be annoying to the server that it was just a dietary choice not a real allergy and I was wasting her time with these questions. They also didn't have any non dairy milk which I thought was odd (not even soy milk) given that coconut milk or almond milk are pretty common nowadays in most places.Overall I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but if I was in the area and there wasn't a wait I would probably give it another shot even though I am more likely to go to Flour next door instead.",3,5/31/2016,The Friendly Toast
482,"Exactly what we were looking for. A low-key, slightly funky breakfast place with a great menu - lots of options. Did a build-my-own omelette with a list of more ingredient options than I could handle, including avocado   Wife had a salmon Benedict on Anadama bread, cooked exactly the way she asked. What more could you want.",5,6/3/2016,The Friendly Toast
483,"Average place serving a variety of food. Staff seemed stretched since the waitress wasn't always around. She also did not give us the 50% off appetizer even though it was clearly in the hour range for it. There's outdoor seating in the summer time which was nice. The Boom Boom Room downstairs was shady early and is likely more crowded in the evening hours but there was no one there when we went at 7pm on a Fri night.1. Buffalo dip - Great to split among 3-4 people. Not too spicy but the bleu cheese makes it heavy on the stomach. It did not come with enough chips (maybe ~8 total) and 4 celery sticks. Not sure if they wanted us to just gobble up the dip with spoons. It was confusing. I ended up ordering more celery.2. Pit burger - Weird sweet BBQ (?) sauce taste even though I was expecting regular BBQ sauce. The rest of the burger was good though. About 1 inch patty, juicy, flavorful but pretty oily.3. Boom sauce beer - Heavy, sweet, pricey ($9)4. Sangia - Sweet, not much alcohol in it ($9). It tasted more like pre-mix rather than made freshOverall, I'll consider coming back for breakfast but probably not for drinks or dinner.",3,6/4/2016,The Friendly Toast
484,"Very disappointed by our experience at this location. We sat down and were basically ignored for 20 minutes. Then someone finally came to our table (manager?) and informed us our server was Victoria. We still have no idea who is Victoria; the only decent service we got was when we asked for the bill. That was returned surprisingly on time. The chicken sandwich was quite dry and salty. This is very unfortunate because we loved their Kendall sq. location. Hope this place improves over time, otherwise Viga across the street is a much better option.",2,6/4/2016,The Friendly Toast
485,"Great place for Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch. They get a large crowd early so get there early. I try to order different food, but I always return to Chicken and Waffles hold the gravy. The staff is nice, mostly girls so diversity is a little lacking besides the male bartenders. They use an app to hold your place in line if there is a big wait I recommend downloading it. Their location is right across from the Back Bay station so easy to get to. Give it a go and you will be satisfied.",4,6/5/2016,The Friendly Toast
486,"Unfortunate that the food here was mediocre at best, unlike all the meals i've had up in Portsmouth and even Cambridge.  Food was incredibly slow, came out slightly burned. This location doesn't have quite the same OG charm as in Portsmouth. I hope they figure it out.",2,6/5/2016,The Friendly Toast
487,Great coffee. Food came out cold but it came out really fast which seems odd. I'll probably come back and try something other than huevos rancheros. It was an interesting take on a classic but the salsa let it down as did portion size and price.  Promising but not quite up to snuff.,3,6/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
488,"This place is great! They have a ton of options on their menu (we went for brunch) and everyone found something that they were excited about. The coconut pancake was great, and when I tried bites of other stuff it was good too. The one downside was that they don't take reservations, and with a group of 7 it was kind of a pain. But I think with a smaller group it would be easier. I used their no wait app, and that seemed to help.",5,6/11/2016,The Friendly Toast

491,Great comfort food with gourmet flair. I had the egg sandwich on oatmeal.  Delicious and big portions.,5,6/13/2016,The Friendly Toast
492,"I love this place! The staff is super friendly!! I've actually made friends with them outside of the Friendly Toast! The food is always delicious, no matter what you order. And the drinks are also amazing! Definitely check it out :)",5,6/14/2016,The Friendly Toast
493,"An overrated, overhyped place that doesn't match the one in Kendall Square in terms of food or quality. We made a reservation for 8 people over the phone, and the host--a young female no older than 21--didn't even ask for our name. When we arrived, the place was jam packed, and we were told our party would have to split up at different tables on opposite sides of the room. I didn't understand what the hype was about the Fries. The sweet potato Fries were shriveled and bland. The waiters took 44 mins before bringing out our food, and forget about wanting more water for your glass. At least the portion sizes are very good.This place is good for youngsters who want the fun experience of eating brunch with a hipster setting. The wall decors are definitely on the stranger side.",3,6/14/2016,The Friendly Toast
494,"Not a shabby place to grab a bite after a night of straight craziness.  Probably why the food was so good.  Biscuits and gravy, no traditional, are pretty dang good.  Who would have thought to put an egg under the gravy?  Delicious and runny! The only issue I had is they don't serve this great looking Bloody Mary until after 1030. What's the point, Boston?",4,6/15/2016,The Friendly Toast
495,Tried this place out for breakfast on a whim. The interesting flavor combinations and the quality of ingredients exceeded any expectation. Hubs had the bacon maple omelet and I had the chorizo mash.  Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Go to this place! Yum!,5,6/17/2016,The Friendly Toast
496,"Absolute five star meal. Just visiting for the weekend and having dinner here is a real highlight. I got the ""Peasant"" plate which despite being under the healthy section was filling, flavorful and exciting. Cheddar cayenne toast had some delicious heat and my sangria was beautifully garnished and so tasty. Service was perfect and everyone utterly concerned with my satisfaction. I see you, Boston.",5,6/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
497,"I would strongly urge anyone going to this restaurant for brunch to use the app to place your name on the wait list, otherwise you will end up waiting about 45-60 minutes for a table when you could just arrive 5-10 minutes before a table is ready. I would highly recommend the biscuits, we got a side order of one grilled with vegetarian gravy. The biscuit was buttery and fluffy and absolutely perfect, I bet it would taste even better at the Cambridge location where it is actually made daily!The chicken and waffles were ok. The chicken tenders were awesome and some of the best I have ever had, but the waffles were nothing special. We also got an omelet with corned beef has which was really disappointing. There was not a lot of flavor in the hash and the eggs themselves were rather bland also. The home fries that came as a side had a strong to kick to them that was not mentioned on the menu. The order of toast that came with it was the best part of the omelette, and while the roast was actually fantastic I did not order the dish for the toast. Overall, I think this place might be a little over hyped and definitely not worth the extreme wait times. Would I go back? Maybe, but only because it's really close to my house. I would give their lunch/dinner menu a try. But there are a ton of brunch places that I would prefer to try then go back here again.",3,6/20/2016,The Friendly Toast
498,Everything was just OK. It would do in a pinch for a quick breakfast but it really wasn't anything special and it felt overpriced for the quality. I will say the homemade bread was delicious. I could see grabbing a loaf of that to go!,2,6/20/2016,The Friendly Toast
499,"Great food although portions are too big!  The children in the restaurant were very poorly behaved but that wasn't fault of the servers. Parents, get some control of your kids. Jumping jacks in a restaurant is essentially on the NO list.",4,6/22/2016,The Friendly Toast
500,"4 of us came here today for breakfast/lunch today.  Verdict was probably 3 & 1/2 stars, but Yelp doesn't let you give half stars, and because the server forgot requested Avacado as a side on 1 meal and the requested  Avacado was missing on a sandwich,  I 'll rate them 3 stars.  The menu is adventurous, but they 'Just missed' on tje execution. I made the mistake of getting oatmeal bread with my sandwich. It was sliced very thick, and the dried out bread killed the taste od the club sandwich.  Once I deconstructed it, the bacon, smoked Turkey, and very flavorful marinated chicken were good.  I tried to revive the Oatmeal bread with the avacado once the server finally brought it, but it was not ripe and therefore hard with a bitter taste.  I opted for the fruit instead of the fries, and it was very good.  No one finished their food, an based on all the bread going back to the kitchen I wonder if all the breads suffered from dryness.  Comments from the table behind me and next to me were in the line of 'I shoud have ordered------and ""maybe I just ordered wrong'''.",3,6/25/2016,The Friendly Toast
501,"We loved the kitchy decor and casual atmosphere and got a good first impression when we walked in and were immediately greeted and seated. The omelets were a little greasy and they didn't chop any of the ingredients, so I had to eat my omelet with a fork and knife--kind of a pain.The waitress was indifferent to us. She checked on us two seconds after we got our food and then didn't come back except to bring the check. No coffee refills were offered, and their cups are very small to begin with. I overheard another customer who had to stop a server who was walking across the restaurant with a coffee pot to ask if he could have more.It wasn't a BAD experience, but I wouldn't go back.",3,6/26/2016,The Friendly Toast
502,Great food and atmosphere! Had a awesome mimosa on a Monday afternoon.  P.s. The men are good eye candy here as well.,5,6/27/2016,The Friendly Toast
503,"Always a good time, coming here, since they opened.Pleasant wait staff; Kevin was great today! Half-off appz (mon-fri) and the Ann Marie's quesadillas is amazing! Trivia on Tuesdays is at friendly toast was a first for me- lots of fun, positive energy!",5,6/28/2016,The Friendly Toast
504,"I stayed a few extra nights after being in Boston for business so I could see some old familiar sites from when I was in college. I also like to do things more local than tourist, so I decided to give this place a shot.Like another reviewer, I was not pleased with the customer service from early on. I had chosen to sit in the patio area, but asked to be moved farther back so I could be in the shade. I sat there for about 20/25 minutes without either waiter approaching me. Both just kept taking other tables that had been seated after me. I finally flagged down who I thought was the manager and explained the situation. She took my order, and eventually a waiter brought out a water to me. He also profusely apologized and said he thought my table was the other guy's table. To be honest, I've waited tables, and I'm pretty sure I was the other guy's table... Anyway, to make up for it, they actually comped my meal.So how was the food? The eggs and bacon were your typical eggs and bacon. However, pancakes were great. They rivaled one of our breakfast joints in Austin.As for the vibe of this place? Definitely low key and hipster, so don't expect fast and rushed service. I absolutely did not have that expectation walking in, but I do have issues being overlooked as a solo diner. They made amends, hence the high score. They would've gotten five stars if they had fresh squeezed juice. :-)",4,6/30/2016,The Friendly Toast
505,"Best Brunch I have ever had! If you are in Boston make the trip here. I ordered an egg scramble with avocado, salsa, black beans and cheddar cheese. It was amazing! Many different hot sauces to choose from also. My boyfriend had the Mexican Mashup. It was AMAZING! Mashed spicy potatoes with chorizo,chipotle cream sauce and eggs. The BEST part was the home made toast that came with each dish. We tried the Cinnamon raisin that was served warm and gooey (almost like a gourmet Cinnabon) and the Cheddar Cayenne. Omg so delicious! Mimosas were beautiful as well! Only $9 for a big one! Only thing to keep in mind is that the wait can be pretty extensive. If you don't mind sitting at the bar (one upstairs and one downstairs) then you can be seated fairly quickly.",5,7/2/2016,The Friendly Toast
506,"Yummy and unique choices.  It was a busy Saturday morning, so our food took a good long time to come, and we had to ask our server about it a few times.  She was very kind and tried to express her concern for our late food too.  When it did arrive, It was tasty.  I did not get offered the upgraded real maple syrup, and I would have liked some.",4,7/3/2016,The Friendly Toast
507,"Came here for brunch on a busy 4th of July. Used the nowait app, which was helpful. Ended up waiting about 30 minutes once we got to the restaurant, instead of 45-60. Ordered the greek scramble and 2 piece cinnamon raisin french toast to share for 2 people. French toast was very good, while the omelette was decent. Also got the bacon bloody mary which was fine.",4,7/4/2016,The Friendly Toast
508,"Great Mimosas and Bloody Mary's !  Menu is a little overwhelming so just go for the first thing you see, it's all good! The ""kitchen sink"" was really good!! Use the Waitlist app to get in line for a table before you arrive, there's always a line out the door.",5,7/9/2016,The Friendly Toast
509,Food was average but service was horrible. Both the hostess and server were extremely rude. When we asked the sever questions about the menu items she was very unhelpful and down right rude. Save your time and money. I'm sure there are better places in Boston to eat with more friendly and helpful employees.,2,7/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
510,"I had great breakfast experience here. If I lived in the area I would come here all the time. The maître d' was very helpful directing us since we didn't know the area well. Jen was friendly and attentive, as were the other servers. I ordered their biscuits and gravy with vegetarian sausage which was delicious. I don't normally like vegetarian sausage but theirs was decent. Maybe it was the great pepper gravy that made it better. The moist, buttery biscuit was just as wonderful, and the runny egg was a perfect complement to the dish.",5,7/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
511,Breakfast was in a word- AWESOME! First let me say we are a family of five and visiting Boston from NY so we are used to waiting for a table. The host told us 15 minutes and thankfully there is a cute park across the street so our kids played while we waited. We were texted within 15 and sat down to have a great breakfast. Warning their pancakes are HUGE our very hungry 12 year old only finished about a third of his two pancakes. All of the food was delicious and we would recommend it to other families for breakfast. The restaurant was located in a cute part of Back Bay and was just perfect. Our server Josh was also very attentive and gave us great service!,5,7/11/2016,The Friendly Toast
512,Great food. We had a cheese burger and patty melt with fries and sweet potato fries. Yum yum!,5,7/11/2016,The Friendly Toast
513,Great place for after club late night eats! This location is open until 3am.  The Cambridge one is only open until 12am.  Pancakes are so delicious!,5,7/13/2016,The Friendly Toast
514,For someone who goes out for brunch all over the city it was very upsetting to have such a poor experience ordering take-out before work. The food was distasteful. I ordered a vegetarian meal and when I arrived to work I discovered they gave me meat instead of my request for tofu sausage. I had asked for avocado and was given a glob of old guacamole. The home fries were not cooked thoroughly and we're still hard. As a vegetarian for 28 years it was extremely upsetting.,1,7/14/2016,The Friendly Toast
515,One of my favorite brunch places in the Boston area. I have brought friends and family here for 5 years and its still a favorite! The biscuits and gravy are amazing and they make some tasty cocktails. Fantastic specials,5,7/14/2016,The Friendly Toast
516,"I had the Sklarmageddon This is right from their menu - 14.00 - an omelette built to kill, with sausage, bacon, ham, red-chile pecans, jalapeño-jack & swiss cheeses, topped with a zesty maple sour cream. I was expecting it to be bursting with flavor but was disappointed. The meats seemed so cooked that they didn't have much flavor left and the ""zesty"" maple sour cream tastes like a cream sauce with a bit of maple. If I go back I would try something else. They must have great thing because the place is full.",3,7/16/2016,The Friendly Toast
517,"Visited Friendly Toast Back Bay for the third time yesterday and I am a big fan. The food is really good; its down down to earth, no frills, comfort breakfast and lunch. I don't expect it to blow anyone away but I think you'll be pleased with your choice. The only food item I've been unhappy with was the homemade cinnamon raisin toast; it was really dry which I know is a common issue for homemade bread but you can't knock them for trying and it makes the absolute best french toast. On second thought, I'm not crazy about the home fries either, they're well seasoned but their potato chip shape detracts from them (don't reinvent the wheel, keep em' cubed). The portions are pretty large but nothing is too greasy or indulgent. The pancakes are worth a try, you can get one on the side and split it with someone if you can't commit or are not really a sweet breakfast person like myself. It's not one of those places where you'd be hard pressed to find something that sounds good on the menu. The drinks are really good and they are huge! It's one of the only places I can think of where you'd almost get what you paid for in a $10+ cocktail, they are made in normally 16oz water glasses. They drinks and special menu items are really creative and rotate regularly which is a very refreshing change from a lot of the stale menus throughout the city. The only thing that really bugs me is how dark it is, there are only windows in the front and they don't penetrate so it has an almost underground feel. Definitely wouldn't be my first choice for brunch on a beautiful day but they do move quickly so you won't miss to much of the day if you're looking to stroll Back Bay following your meal. Friendly Toast is expensive as far as breakfast goes but its not outrageous and you won't walk away hungry. They actually do a pretty cool rewards program; if you download the app you'll get a $20 gift card for every $200 you spend. Did I mention they are open until 3:00AM? I'm not sure how they swing that but it's pretty awesome.  Almost forgot, the wait time can creep way up there. Seems to clear out around 2:00PM on weekends. I've heard you can put your name on the wait list with their app but I haven't tried that yet (I never wait more than ten minutes).",4,7/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
518,"I've turned into a breakfast fiend the past year so the fact that they are open late and serve brunch every day makes this place my new second home. The vibe is great, the food was tasty and the server was attentive.",5,7/19/2016,The Friendly Toast
519,"Items Tasted:CoffeeGrilled CornbreadGrilled Blueberry MuffinGrilled BiscuitLobster BenedictCoconut Chocolate Chip PancakesMonte Cristo on Oatmeal French Toast with Strawberry Jalapeno JamPlanning to spend much of the day in Providence, though breakfast plans turned to Boston for an early start, suffice it to say that nothing could have prepared our group for the disaster that was The Friendly Toast in Back Bay where the only thing less inspiring than the service may have been the food itself.Apparently part of a small chain, additional locations found in Portsmouth and Cambridge, The Friendly Toast purports a ""family friendly atmosphere with a unique menu featuring locally sourced ingredients"" and although the latter may be true to some extent, the former seems to mean 'loud and understaffed, with several of the waitresses barely capable of smiling or filling a glass of water.'Seated close to the door, one part due to the place being quite busy and additionally to avoid a few large tables that seemed to be chasing the night prior despite it being only Thursday, it was shortly after opening menus that the waitress first stopped by to collect drink orders and with coffee and water both filled by a different staff member it was nearly twenty minutes before an order was placed, empty glasses completely ignored in the process which necessitated a trip to the bar with my coffee mug, another unhelpful young woman refusing service and instead suggesting she would ""tell the waiter.""Acknowledging the crowd, not to mention a conversation overhead near the timeclock about two persons running late, it was nonetheless ten more minutes before a second woman was flagged down to refill beverages, our 'designated' server returning with food perhaps fifteen minutes thereafter...only to have botched the order.At this point half-amused by the mediocrity, Grilled Cornbread just fine while both the Blueberry Muffin and Biscuit were so dry that one wondered if they were day-old, the Lobster Benedict served on Toast was perhaps the menu's loan savior as an ample amount of tender meat was found beneath two poached eggs and respectable Hollandaise, the Coconut Chocolate Chip Pancakes a touch dry even before adding pure Maple Syrup brought from elsewhere while the late-arriving Monte Cristo was simply set down without an apology or description, the presentation just fine for an unfried version, though the Housemade Jam offered very little in the way of heat amidst the over-sweetened strawberry flavor.",1,7/19/2016,The Friendly Toast
520,"I am very picky when it comes to Chicken & Waffle entrees but THIS was the greatest decision I have ever made.The reason why I get picky is because: chicken and waffles don't really go together, in my opinion. Sometimes the salty of the chicken and the sweetness of the waffle syrup clash. So I guess I keep hoping that each restaurant I try will prove me wrong. Well, Friendly Toast proved me wrong.The chicken comes in the form of juicy & savory chicken tenders, laid on top of a fluffy waffle, and drowned in a corn gravy. I asked for the gravy on the side and for some syrup so that I could satisfy the salty and sweet cravings I had that day. And that was actually a good choice. It felt like I was eating two, very good entrees. The corn gravy was surprisingly very good, and a little sweet, but was not too sweet. But the syrup on the waffle and the chicken was also its own perfect combination.I rarely ever want to go back to a restaurant just for one dish, without wanting to try the others, so this will be a first for me. I definitely recommend trying this dish. Feel free to yell at me if you hate it (but I highly doubt you will)!",5,7/21/2016,The Friendly Toast
521,Food was okay but given the reviews we were expecting more. My boyfriend had eggs Benedict which were overcooked and I had a piece of French toast on their cinnamon raisin bread. The French toast wasn't bad but it was one piece of bread on a plate with no artistry for $8. For 1 piece of bread. Coffee was good but the service was poor. But hey at least they had a Pokemon themed special menu,3,7/22/2016,The Friendly Toast
522,"Very pleased. Long wait on a late Sat morning, as expected. Thankfully waited in an A/C'd basement bar. Very attentive staff despite the crowds. Great menu choices.

523,"Greeted warmly by staff. I came in on a late Monday morning so the place was quiet with only a few tables filled. I ordered their eggs Benedict with bacon, tomato, and spinach. Home fries were crispy with a little kick of cayenne, the hollandaise sauce was buttery and creamy and not overly rich. English muffin was a little crispy and i wish the bacon was more thick cut.

Their food has always been delicious and quite filling. On our visit, we ordered the following dishes:Lobster Haul - Essentially an Egg's Benedict w/ lobster meat atop a homemade roll. It was quite filling and delicious. We thought the hollandaise sauce complimented the lobster well. Sklarmageddon - Interesting omelette w/ sausage, bacon, red-chili cashews, and jalapeño cheese. There was some maple syrup in it as well. I added broccoli to add a crunch to it. Overall, this was pretty good! I had wheat toast with it and it was pretty big. Coconut Cake - Very yummy! Drizzled with chocolate syrup and coconut sauce. It was topped with pecans, cashews, chocolate chips, and shredded coconuts.",4,7/28/2016,The Friendly Toast
528,"Pros: Good Food, good crowd,  a lot of variety.Cons: Slow service on a Sunday at 9am and it wasn't even that busy.

I will give it another shot at the Cambridge location.",2,7/29/2016,The Friendly Toast
529,"Not really sure what the hype's about. A lot of flair, very little flavor.This place was jammed on a Saturday at around 11am but we got seated at the bar immediately.  Ordered a garden omelette (simple generic breakfast plate) and an ""Ole Miss"" (something more unique to this place).The garden omelette was relatively decent in terms of fresh produce, but had absolutely no seasoning.  Came with lumpy, cold, unseasoned home fries that were probably just hanging out in a tin bucket for a few hours, waiting to get scooped onto a plate.  Then the Ole Miss, which was supposed to be scrambled egg and sausage on cheddar toast with some mashed sweet potato.  Sounds pretty good to me...except the plate shows up and it's absolutely covered in mashed sweet potato.  This stuff is absolutely slathered all over the plate, and has made the ""cheddar toast"" just a soggy extension of the sweet potato.  The 'scrambled' egg was nothing but an unseasoned cold lump sitting on top of it all.  And on the side of all of this...another massive serving of cold, lumpy, unseasoned homefries.  But hey, at least the sausage on the plate was good.  Cool.  The cinnamon raisin toast that came with the omelette (not one slathered in an absurd amount of mashed sweet potato) was also not bad.  For the prices you pay, things like homefries are a given.  Things like seasoning your eggs are a given.  But they aren't here, just go to Thorton's instead for actual food.",2,7/29/2016,The Friendly Toast

535,"When we walked into the restaurant we were told it was a 5-10 minute wait. To pass the time we went next store to Flour Bakery to get Spindrifts. When we came back we were seated and the hostess told us we could not have outside drinks and took them from us after only about 5 sips (although we saw many people with coffee and smoothies from other cafes). When our waitress came to take our order we got omelettes and french toast. About an hour wait later our food arrived. The omelettes were sitting in a puddle of grease and the french toast was burnt. They forgot to bring the toast our breakfast came with and then when we asked, they brought us the wrong kind. The home fries were practically wet slivers of potatoes slopped onto the plate. Although the service and most of the food we got wasn't the best, the homemade toast was really good. We now know we won't be going back to The Friendly Toast any time soon.",2,8/6/2016,The Friendly Toast
536,"Honestly a pretty mediocre brunch. My friend and I went here as it was the only place open early-ish on a Sunday morning; we'd also heard good things about it from our friends and saw good reviews on the Cambridge location.My friend got the BLT benedict, + avocado, hollandaise on the side. I got the healthy sandwich on gluten free bread (don't quite remember the name) and subbed the fruit salad for bacon and added avocado.Not going to lie, I completely disassembled my sandwich and reassembled it. The avocado came on the side, so I had to add it in; I also added in the bacon, some of my friend's home fries, and whole lot of hot sauce, because the sandwich was just severely lacking in flavor.My friend's BLT benedict looked a little like a disaster (there was a LOT of lettuce), and she similarly disassembled her food as well. Overall, a decent brunch spot, but nothing that special. If you're looking for a place to get pancakes bigger than your head, this is definitely the place to go. If you want a good, satisfying brunch, don't go here.",3,8/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
537,Should this place even market itself as a breakfast/brunch place if they can't get french toast right? I had the pecan or was it walnut? french toast with some bananas cooked into it. It was soggy and plain and unimpressive. It also costed like $13 if I remember correctly. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and it oddly had corn sprinkled on top...wtf? That was weird.,1,8/11/2016,The Friendly Toast

540,"That's what I'm talking about! There were so many things I wanted to order but I only have one stomach and only one meal at the Friendly Toast. I had the biscuits and gravy which was decadent....and delicious. I particularly liked the gravy which was peppery and rich. We used Nowait to get in line and it was perfect, particularly because there's very little space to wait (especially when it's raining out as it was when we were there).",4,8/13/2016,The Friendly Toast
541,"I came here with several friends to try out the place. Seemed like a pretty solid place for brunch, especially considering the numerous options they had for the different benedicts (I'm a total fan)! I ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict, which was pretty underwhelming. A benedict is really made by its sauce and the wellness of the egg yolk. When I cut into the egg, it was almost hard-boiled. No drip, which was pretty unfortunate. On top of that, the bread had a very interesting texture, and both eggs were placed on only one. There was also very little amount of smoked salmon on top. The sauce was nothing ordinary; in fact, I just ate it and I rarely remember the taste of it, which speaks for itself. This came out to be a total of $14, which I would say, is definitely not worth it. My friend, however, ordered the lobster benedict, which looked like a lobster roll mixed with eggs benedict. Now, I can get down with that. I actually had a bite of that and that was much better.On top of the food, though, the service was slow. There was barely anyone in the restaurant when we came, yet we still had to continue waiting for the waiter to come serve us. Did not have the best experience to say the least, and I will probably not be back.",2,8/14/2016,The Friendly Toast
542,"Modern diner with a really good breakfast, good sandwiches and a full bar! Breakfast all day.  Do you want to fill up before hitting the bars and not spend a fortune? This is the place.",4,8/15/2016,The Friendly Toast
543,"So I've had the chance to sample a few more things from this HUGE menu and not been disappointed yet.  The Irish Benny is great and the hash is extremely flavorful.  The coconut pancake was always delicious as was the guy scramble.  The service is fast and friendly.If we are ranking today, Id go1.  Irish Benny2.  Ole Miss3.  Coconut Pancake4.  Guy Scramble",5,8/17/2016,The Friendly Toast
544,"Beyond delicious! This is the rare place that lives up to the hype. The portions are huge, the options almost endless, and the flavors out of this world! The atmosphere is fun and quirky. Not to be missed!",5,8/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
545,"I know I showed up very late to The Friendly Toast last night/this morning at 2:30 AM. However, it was an after work plan for one of my friends & I who had got out of work late. I was very disappointed in the food served. The meals looked very good; the Monte Cristo tacos, Skarmageddon omelette, and Chicken & Waffles. We were both extremely hungry since he hadn't ate at work all day, but the food had little flavor, not a good combination of flavors, it was very cold, and it took them forever to ask us for our orders. Not to mention, I know for a fact that the food made my stomach kill today and I didn't eat too much. The servers were nice, but I can't say that I would go back, unfortunately :-(.",1,8/21/2016,The Friendly Toast
546,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for breakfast on a weekday morning. Like many of the other Yelpers, I downloaded the No Wait app, but ended up just sitting at the bar instead.For our meal, we decided to split an order of the french toast and the guy scramble. The french toast was good--I can't quite remember what type of bread we got it with, but it was a decent sized portion and had good flavor.Surprisingly, the guys scramble was probably my favorite dish of the two as all of the components came together so well.Overall, this place is definitely popular so either come early or prepare to wait. Service was friendly and attentive and vibe of the place is definitely unique, especially for Boston.",4,8/21/2016,The Friendly Toast
547,Great breakfast and cocktails! My friend & I are visiting from Michigan and had some awesome mimosa variations & breakfast specials. Our server Kenny was super helpful and friendly. Definitely will return next time I'm in Boston!,5,8/22/2016,The Friendly Toast
548,"Loooong wait, good food, great menu, great atmosphere. The best part was the diverse menu - fun to choose, even if you can only eat so much! Worst part was we waited an hour on a Monday at 11 am, after being told 20 mins!  I'll never come here again without using the Nowait app. All the college kids back in town must have been swarming the place. Quick kitchen service and decent table service made up for it some. I got the Omar's Homefries which was good but had no flavor. Don't come here for eggs and Homefries -  I bet their French toast and pancakes are amazing. I'd like to come back and try something else on the menu before deciding whether I like the place! Without the unexpected wait (and grumpy friends) I'd definitely give it a 4 or 5.",3,8/22/2016,The Friendly Toast
549,"Great place for breakfast.  Good menu serving a nice mix of breakfast items.  I had the biscuits and gravy which were full of flavor.  My parter had the BLT Benny which was a nice version of eggs Benedict,  and our friend had the guys scramble which was also very good.  Portions were also nice sized.Service was great.  They were friendly and most importantly kept our coffees full.  The food also did not take long to get either.  I would definitely go back next time in Boston.",4,8/23/2016,The Friendly Toast
550,"Waited too long to get seated, even with space for us an a reservation, and we were there with our pregnant friend. Also waited over 45 minutes for our food. Unnecessary. Food was okay... I wouldn't recommend this place and I wouldn't come back here either.",1,8/25/2016,The Friendly Toast
551,"**I give this place 3 stars based on my experience I had when I ate there for breakfast**In my opinion the server was extremely slow and not attentive and my breakfast was overpriced and not that good. Me and my friend ordered two orders of scrambled omlets with sides and coffee for $40.... I was expecting a lot more.  The me I looked decent and it maybe a great place to got for brunch or drinks. But for just breakfast, I wouldn't.",3,8/25/2016,The Friendly Toast
552,"The decor is awesome, the food is tasty (although about 20% overpriced), but the staff is sparse so the service is slow. PS - They don't have bleu cheese dressing.",4,8/25/2016,The Friendly Toast
553,"Great food! We had the eggs Benedict and some drinks. Fabulous Bloody Mary and mimosa! Our waitress was a little - she kept forgetting out order and kept coming to ask is what we ordered (for drinks, for meals). The wrong item came out anyway... Still worth it! Use the noWait up to save your sled time.",4,8/30/2016,The Friendly Toast
554,"Ughhhh... So, this place is totally funky and fun, with funky, fun and creative dishes. I seriously want to rave, but it's been, sadly, pretty spotty. When we went to the Portsmouth location, we were in love so we were totally pumped when they opened a location in Back Bay. Our first visit , it was completely packed but we were able to sit at the bar. The bartender was completely nice, but its obvious they're completely swamped, so service is pretty absurdly slow. Funky and fun is no longer fun when you're not being served. Funky and fun also goes out the window when the poached egg tastes like the eggs offered on a cruise ship. Ugghhhh. Because I was still obsessed with the Portsmouth experience, we decided to give it another go and again sat at the bar. He got Chicken and Waffles; I got an interesting and tasty dish with sweet potatoes and sausage. Food was better this time around, but the bartender was still completely swamped. Seriously, Friendly Toast, please hire a second bartender. Your staff are running around like maniacs, and it isn't good. Maybe this place would be better when it isn't ridiculously crowded, so that they'd have time to provide adequate service. Maybe we should go on a Tuesday at like... 3 in the afternoon. That being said, if it's a normal brunch time that normal people want to eat, you may be better skipping it, or driving up to Portsmouth.",3,9/5/2016,The Friendly Toast
555,Such a cool spot and the food is delish. Thanks to yelp it led us here on a Saturday night after I had a few drinks I must eat and an omelette sounded so good. Server was real nice and attentive also I saw that they close at 3am. How can you go wrong there.,4,9/5/2016,The Friendly Toast
556,"This place is sooooo cute! The decor is super funky, old skool Diner with a modern twist. Their Monte Cristo is HUGE & sooooo yummy. It's actually to die for! I highly recommend checking it out next time you're in Boston!",5,9/6/2016,The Friendly Toast
557,"Not only does Friendly Toast offer a unique but certainly delicious menu, it has a full bar, a great patio, and a fun ambiance.I went for brunch with my husband and another couple, and sad to say, we were all a bit on the hungover side.  However, that meant we were all in the mood for something a little off the wall and somewhat healthy, but not too over the top healthy.   The FT was just the place.I went conservative and ordered an American Burrito but between us we ordered the Consciously Uncoupled Eggs, Taco After Party, and a FT Benny.  Plus a couple of Bloody Mary's and Mimosa's.  All were simply delish and everyone gobbled every bite.One star knocked off because service was a little slow, but that won't deter me from coming back again.   I highly recommend this place for brunch but I'd like to try out their other items too.  Everything looks awesome!",4,9/9/2016,The Friendly Toast
558,"Excellent food! We stayed at Park plaza, I wanted brunch/breakfast and their menu looked delicious as I was on Yelp in our hotel room. We decided to go it was around 10:30, they said a 20 min wait we were seated after 6 min, thank you Breakfast gods. I wish I had better pieces of chicken on my waffle... That was nonetheless the best home made waffle. The chorizo corn gravy was so good!!! My husband had the biscuits and gravy overhard eggs and no tomatoes! They got our orders perfectly. It's about $30-36 for two people for two entrees and coffees($3 each). The place serves food all day whether it's breakfast or lunch so that's awesome!! Friendly waitstaff, decor is beautiful inside, service was exceptional and we can't wait to return to one of their 3 locations. A gem near Back Bay!!",4,9/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
559,"Excellent system they have going with the Nowait app. Considering they don't take reservations this is a good substitute. We were seated promptly and the patio has a nice vibe. Food looks amazing walking past and led us to order the Ann Marie quesadilla which was a fantastic bite. C.U. eggs were sloppy and a huge let down given the appetizing description on the menu. Coffee wasn't refilled, which it always should be at brunch, and service trailed off toward the end. Minus point for plastic plates and cups- what are we in kindergarten? Overall a decent brunch spot and very reasonably priced but there is better in Boston.",3,9/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
560,"Me and some co-workers had lunch there today and one of us had an issue with their food. It was brought to our waitress'  attention and the Manager was very apologetic and quickly offered another dish. Not only did he remove his meal from our check, but he took 50% off our entire check (party of 5). Also, he gave the person who had the issue a free meal for a future visit.  The handling of the issue was EXCEPTIONAL! Not to mention, the rest of us enjoyed our meal. We will be back!",5,9/16/2016,The Friendly Toast
561,"This was my second meal here, the first was fairly mediocre, too. I ordered for myself and my friend, two stirfry with chicken. She only brought one :/  The dish was acceptable. It tasted like the stuff that used to make in college, except that they used some sort of extremely processed brown rice like Uncle Ben's. Also it was clear the dish had added sugar. The chicken was tasty though. The only reason we went was because Flour was insanely crowded. This place wasn't. Probably for good reason.",2,9/16/2016,The Friendly Toast
562,"We got the Taco Party I think.... very unique...spicy and satisfying, except the ""homefries"" were more like scalloped potatoes that weren't cooked enough. Coffee was weak and watery. The table settings lacked a couple normal items, but at least the waitresses were all friendly.Price of the dishes was on the high side and I didn't feel like the portions were that generous.... you most likely won't have leftovers.. I was craving something else three hours later..... and Im not a big eater.Food seems very flavorful,  I give a five for food quality in spite of the undercooked home fries and a five for the decor.... interesting but not too busy... a nice balance.",3,9/17/2016,The Friendly Toast
563,"Poached eggs - ease off on the vinegar in your cooking water, the poached eggs have been basically hard boiled, but very sour, so a good idea is to please *kitchen*, either control the vinegar amount in your cooking water, or when the water boils off, please do add more water. The food is semi OK.  I have been to TFT three weekends in a row now, and ordered a variation of the eggs benny, all three times, the eggs have been overcooked and very sour tasting.  The hollandaise sauce that I get on the side is probably meant to cover the sour taste of the eggs, but since I do not use it, the sourness of the eggs is overwhelming.  Discovered TFT by accident, well I was headed to meet a friend at Zocalo, the previous restaurant at that place for lunch, but say it was a different place and was very busy, so we stayed and ate there.  The food was again sub par, but my brunch/lunch weekly friend meet up time was more valuable.  So to keep things simple we met there two more times after the initial first, ergo, I waited to see if the food ""sour poached eggs"" was a glitch.  But every time that happened.   Here is what I know about 35 Stanhope St.  It is a tricky location.  In the past 5 years there have been at least two different restaurants that have not been able to make it.  So when the novelty wears off, the locations is not something that will save the place, the only thing left is quality, and as of now that is lacking.  It is a great concept and a very profitable idea, since breakfast food is not the most expensive thing to make, but for the love of Darwin, do it RIGHT!!!",1,9/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
564,"This is such a cute spot for brunch, I am in love with the whole retro diner vibe. The food is pretty diner-y but I've never been disappointed. Portions are HUGE and a lot of the dishes are interesting and original. I've had the chicken and waffles which I fell IN LOVE with. The corn gravy is a perfect glue between the waffle and the chicken. The line here is always at least 1.5 hours for weekend brunch, so the nowait app is a lifesaver. You can just check in online and show up when your number is called.",4,9/22/2016,The Friendly Toast
565,Food isn't consistent but the good thing is they are willing to take it back as many times as necessary to fix it. Great service as well,4,9/23/2016,The Friendly Toast
566,"We went here for Saturday brunch at around 1:30. The wait for a table was 30 minutes but the hostess kindly found 2 open seats at the bar for us. The atmosphere is super trendy & hipster, comparable to Veggie Galaxy. Unlike Veggie Galaxy, however, the Friendly Toast serves drinks! What we loved? The food, period. The Monte Cristo sandwich is AMAZING... Way better than Trident's for sure. We appreciated the fact that they used real cuts of turkey and ham as opposed to deli slices. They also make some mean pancakes. We went for the King Cakes but we can pretty much assure you any of their pancakes will be awesome.  The portion to price ratio is also great. What could've been better? Aside from some little nit picky things (like being served water in a somewhat dirty glass), there isn't much bad to say about this place. They get crowded quickly but it seems like the host staff does the most they can to make sure you get seated quickly.",5,9/25/2016,The Friendly Toast

568,"A good breakfast spot with an inventive theme.SERVICE: There was a line when I came but the line moved relatively fast. The estimate we were given was over estimated and we were seated before then. We also came on a Sunday during brunch hours, so I imagine it doesn't get too much busier than when we came. Waitresses were friendly and quirky And very willing to engage in conversation. They were a lot of fun and quite possibly my favorite part of the experience. The service was fast here.DRINKS: I had the house mimosa, which was a pretty good, standard mimosa. Not super strong, but it got the job done. ATMOSHPERE:  The place is casual. And the theme is very consistent. The volume here was a lively conversational din, nothing to loud at all.FOOD: The scramble was good. I don't usually get the olives in my eggs, but they were big enough to pick out easily. They came whole. The home fries were really good. My friend said they were the best thing on his plate. They weren't flavored with just salt, and they had the slightest kick. The home fries were not crispy, which is how I usually like them, but the flavor was so good, I didn't mind. The toast was pre-buttered, and therefore a little bit under-buttered in my opinion. I'm sure it would have been fine for someone else.OVERALL: I would return here. And I would recommend",4,10/4/2016,The Friendly Toast
569,"I don't normally write about service/ atmosphere, but this place really bugged me. Upon entering the establishment, we were not greeted by anyone. There was a young lady who stood at the bar and she just looked, and looked, and looked. Besides her was maybe a waitress who also looked on. & finally, a guy who had his nose in his phone stood up and seated us. I paid attention and they did not do this to anyone who came into the restaurant after.French Toast (1pc: 6$). Choose the cinnamon-raisin. It was ok.Irish Benny (14$). Corned beef hash, two poached eggs, and hollandaise on an English muffin. This was tasty! I usually gravitate towards beef hash and hollandaise. The hollandaise was tangy just the way I like it. The homefries that came with this dish were overlooked.I also had a meatloaf served with a siracha honey sauce on oatmeal toast. This dish was good as well. However, I wouldn't order these two dishes together because the flavor profile was very similar.",3,10/5/2016,The Friendly Toast
570,"This place is amazing.  The veggie options are unreal. Everything on the menu is mouth watering. We used the no wait app and literally walked in ahead of dozens of people.we said downstairs in the boom boom room. The music was an awesome 90s throw back. We loved it. The service was fast and our meals were huge and delicious. I ate her sunday morning with my two sisters. We ordered Meg's American burrito, the guy scramble and the taco after party with veggie bacon. We couldn't finish but it was delicious. We want to come back again and try the ole miss. It was hard to make a decision with so many fun choices.",5,10/9/2016,The Friendly Toast

I love when places get creative with their bloody Mary's! The bay of pigs comes with a paprika rim and bacon strips.One of my fave things about the friendly toast is they make their own bread!!! The anadama is soooo good--it's cornmeal and molasses flavors make it the perfect base for sandwiches!! who doesn't love sweet and savory combos??If you love peanut butter and banana, the Elvis is a must!! Extra touches--I love all the gluten free options they have!! Even for almost all pancakes. And z0mg idk if I'd get it but they have vegetarian bacon here!! Also, as an indecisive food lover who wants to try everything, I love that they give you options on how many slices of pancakes you want. One of each please!!",5,10/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
572,"I am an avid breakfast food fan, so when FT hit Back Bay, it was like Christmas in the Summer time. The upstairs has a nice ""classic"" diner feel and it's the only bar I've ever sat at that doesn't over-do the lighting. It has a solid beer/spirits selection and that paired with the French Toast or monster serving of Nachos will keep you and your wallet satisfied.",5,10/11/2016,The Friendly Toast

The waffle was ok- served with two bricks of frozen butter...sighThe breakfast sandwich- meh, side of hollandaise I got for dipping, also meh. Not bad but not that great.Greek pancakes- pretty tasty, even with frozen butter.Hashbrowns- did they even hit the grill bro?Coffee- hahah lol.

577,Great breakfast but a long wait for sure. We took advice if other yelpers and used the nowait app which definitely helped with the wait time. Service was fast and friendly. Bay pig bloody Mary's were awesome! Would definitely recommend this place,4,10/16/2016,The Friendly Toast
578,Loved the Salmon Benny...perfection!  My sister and I shared that and the Ole Miss.  Didn't like the egg on Ole Miss but typically don't like omelet style anyway.   The mashed sweet potatos were the best part of that dish.  I'll stick with Benny and next time will likely try the pork with cornbread.,5,10/16/2016,The Friendly Toast

We all loved our food except one of my friends specifically asked for no tomatoes and the tomatoes came but on the side.

For 20 minutes of that wait at the end, I was looking at 4 empty tables. 45 minutes prior to leaving I was told I had a 15 minute wait as we had an event to be at.

The first time here I had the Mexican mashed meal, which was awesome but huuuge. I had their BLT and it was nothing amazing but not bad at all--just a good sandwich. Yesterday I had the Taco After Party with bacon added to it, which is probably the best thing I've had so far. Again, huge portion that I almost finished (I was reeeeally hungry) but not quite. The tacos were STUFFED with food and were fantastic and the home fries that it came with were also good. I still haven't had many of the lunch/dinner offerings besides the BLT but I'll definitely be back to try it all.",4,10/22/2016,The Friendly Toast
585,"Come here on the weekend, forget it. Come here at 11am on a Tuesday, you got yourself a brunch session. You walk into this place and it feels like you've taken a time machine back into the 70's. This classic, diner-style brunch spot is a must-try. The menu is stocked with brunch classics like benedicts and scrambles--but with a tasty twist, like cheesy grits or tender pulled pork. The staff works hard and is very responsive to coffee/water refills. My friend ordered the Smoked Salmon benny which was tender and flavorful. I ordered a dish (forgot the name) that included fried chicken patties on a biscuit, topped with fried eggs, and a thin layer of cheesy grits drizzled with sriracha honey. The house potatoes were ok. They had a nice kick to them but they were a little dry. We split a slice of anodama(?) French toast. I believe all/most of their breads are made in house, so definitely make it a point to order some carbs. I won't judge you. There are a few restaurants/cafes on the same block as this place so if you're waiting to be seated and the wait is 1-2 hours long, consider going next door to Flour Bakery & Cafe for some coffee! Prices are pretty standard as far as brunch goes. I think between me and my friend, our bill came out to ~$40 for the two dish and the French toast. The coffee was good though so the free refills added a little more value to the bill!",4,10/23/2016,The Friendly Toast
586,Came here on a sunday afternoon at about 3 pm. There wasnt much of a wait but the place was still packed. We were seated in 20 mins (which apparently is not much considering what i read about the place). The staff is super friendly and the service exceptional. The scambled eggs i ordered were not bad but we washed down our meal with the belgian waffle with caramelized apples and nuts and that was heavenly. A must have if you go to this spot for brunch.,4,10/24/2016,The Friendly Toast
587,Delicious!! The King Cakes are amazing. Use the online booking system or you won't get a seat.,5,10/24/2016,The Friendly Toast
588,"Pro Tip: Make a reservation here!! This place is always packed on the weekends and they were telling parties in front of us it would be around a 2 hour wait at 11 am on a Saturday! Luckily for our group of 7 we did have a reservation! We were seated as soon as the slow pokes in the group arrived. Our waiter was great and since the menu is so vast offered us some suggestions. We started off with some bloody marys (5 stars)  Mimosa (3 stars, very basic)  and coffee cocktails (4- but overly sweet) The buffalo chicken dip was calling our name and thank god! It was a perfectly creamy with a hint of heat but not over powering- I wish they had served it with more chips since we ran out with about half the bowl of dip left!!! For my meal I went a little wild and tried the meatloaf burger with a side of cheese fries- The cheese fries were a classier version with blue cheese and melted cheddar not a fake cheese sauce. I asked for my burger without mushrooms and must of been some miscommunication because I did still want the gravy- due to it being served without the gravy it was very dry and not that tasty of meatloaf. Basically a dry piece of meatloaf with some bacon strips on a bun- couldnt taste the garlic aoli at all! Next to me my friend ordered the egg in a hole and no surprise there was an actual hole in the bread- this meant she had to eat it with a fork and knife but overall very tasty! Waitress was really knowledgeable and fun experience but make a reservation and be careful of what you order- some things are on the dry side!",3,10/25/2016,The Friendly Toast
589,"Friendly toast indeed, best friend necklace worthy. The waffle was also friendly. We didn't have a reservation but it was a week day morning, and steadily busy. Decor is conversation worthy if you're with someone where the give and take o words is a struggle. Chicken n waffles meh great idea (good flavor) but our chicken was over fried n dry, there was scant corn gravy which caused food envy on my part due to the table next to us having more chicken and sloppy amounts of gravy. The ole Miss was really good, highly recommended. Side of the anadama toast was lovely.",4,10/29/2016,The Friendly Toast
590,Traveling to Boston for a conference landed me in this little gem. I had the taco after party and skillet potatoes. Both were spicy and delicious. Paired with the hot Maria Bloody Mary left me sweating and smiling. Be aware it's very spicy for those with a low heat tolerance.,5,11/3/2016,The Friendly Toast
591,"The friendly toast is just okay. I've never been wowed by a dish and I've never hated my dining experience. Always just ok.This location has quite a bit of seating and seems to not get as crowded as the one in Kendall Square, but I've never been on a Saturday so take that lightly. I've had pancakes, New Orleans fries, omelette, etc. Diner food, diner coffee. The environment is fun and service is always good, so this is a reasonable alternative to local traditional diners, but don't expect much more from the food just because it seems hipster ;)",3,11/4/2016,The Friendly Toast
592,I found this spot on yelp when my friend and I were in town visiting. When we arrived they told us there would be an hour and a half wait but then magically a table opened up downstairs and we were seated right away! Our server was hilarious and super helpful when we asked specific questions about the menu. My friend is vegan and I have celiac but we still both had a ton of options. I had the scramble and the gf chocolate chip pancake. Everything was great! I will definitely return when I'm in Boston again.,5,11/8/2016,The Friendly Toast
593,"My food was good, however the service was slow even though the restaurant wasn't busy. I enjoyed my chicken and waffles, my friend was less impressed by the runny cheese grits. The menu seemed inventive and fun, but the execution was sub par",3,11/10/2016,The Friendly Toast
594,"I actually like friendly toast a lot... But their service 5/10 visits is awful. Their food is good & the variety is awesome. There is almost no where else in Boston where you can have breakfast all day. (Great breakfast) however, their staffing is interesting... There is so much potential for great service, most of the time the people are nice. But I am not sure if it is the kitchen or the front of house who makes service take forever. Last time I was there I waited 20min for a water, at least 30min to order and then after that an additional 45min minimum for our food to arrive. It was not the first time something similar to this happened during late night and/ or brunch. If they could figure out staffing/ hire more people/ work out these glitches, this place would be great.",3,11/11/2016,The Friendly Toast
595,"I get the sense that there is a great deal of hype around this restaurant. I'm not from Boston, but I do enjoy going to the good places where the locals dine, so I got a late reservation at B&G Oyster.I can't say this place ""wowed"" me.  Decor was super cool and cozy. They were extremely accommodating when we showed up an hour early for our reservation, and escorted us to a table immediately. The waiter was very prompt and had some good suggestions. The only thing that didn't knock my socks off was the food. Don't get me wrong, it was solid. Oysters and clams in the Short Stack were pretty good. Would have been better if someone explained which oyster was which. ""Lasagna"" was rustic and comforting. Mac was yummy and baked.Overall, it was a solid good meal. I don't know if I would go back, but I would recommend it to anyone looking to go to a cool place place with a ton of fresh seafood.",4,11/13/2016,The Friendly Toast
596,"I am indifferent about this place. I can see the hype about this but am not super impressed. I don't understand why there is always a wait. We went around 10 and was told that they would be a 45 minute for a party of 2. We decided to sit at the bar in the dungeon. It is a small room with a few tables and a bar. I had the bay of pigs Bloody Mary. It was alright, not my favorite. I got the garden omelet with a single chocolate chip pancake. It was an interesting having goat cheese in the omelet with mushrooms, spinach and asparagus. The potatoes were good. The food did not have the WOW factor or making me want to go back. The menu has a lot of variety. I agree with other reviewers that the service is slow. It is not worth the wait, don't believe the g",2,11/13/2016,The Friendly Toast
597,"We went here for breakfast around 10 on a Thursday. First the positives: we were seated pretty quickly and food was brought out quickly as well. Unfortunately the service was not that great.  Our waitress Isabelle was not very attentive and we constantly had to flag her down or ask different waiters/waitresses for things we needed (e.g. Napkins, refills on drinks, etc).  My friend asked for wheat toast and received white. And another friends toast was barely toasted. The hot chocolate was very watery and did not have whip cream or marshmallows as promised. We flagged down the manager who was excellent and quickly replaced our drinks with no fuss. Additionally my friends chocolate milk was literally chocolate syrup and milk, meaning milk and syrup that hadn't been stirred. Wut. The food was pretty good and the bread was flavorful (mine at least). But the service ruined the experience.",3,11/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
598,"Visiting from NY and stumbled across this place from Yelp. It was close to my hotel and not a disappointment. Decor: it's a funky, cute, bright, clean spaceService: attentive, friendly, made great suggestions Food: I ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chili. My friend ordered the eggs over easy. EVERYTHING. WAS. DELICIOUS. As someone who hates breakfast food I was appreciative hat the waitress showed us the breakfast specials which is why I ordered the quesadilla. The coffee was hot and delicious and refilled often. The price was reasonable and definitely I would recommend to anyone visiting in the area. I can't say enough nice things about how good it was so I'll let the pictures do the talking",5,11/18/2016,The Friendly Toast
599,"Apparently we had the same idea as many to visit on the weekend for brunch. The wait was a bit over an hour so in the meantime we played around in the small park right outside (see Frieda Garcia park - awesome adult and kid climbing structures!)When you first enter I think you'll be pleasantly immersed in the vibe. I want to use words like ""cool"" and ""rad"" and ""funky"". The bar and the art and the waitresses in cat shirts and colored hair may help to explain that. This is the type of place that makes taxidermy look cool. It's got a great atmosphere, and my favorite part was it's got great cocktails. It's hard to find a breakfast place with good cocktails to accompany the early morning meal but these were amazing. I had some kind of bourbon cinnamon thing which was great and others in my party had a really kick-ass mimosa.I was however disappointed with the food. I ordered the ole miss with eggs, sausage, home fries, and chipotle sweet potatoes. It was a little much. The whole dish ended up to be more or less a pile of mush. If you're a texture person this will remind you of your baby food from yesteryear. The flavors were alright but it was just all too much for me to handle. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dishes so maybe simple is the way to go here.",3,11/19/2016,The Friendly Toast
600,"Thank god for citisearch, where my friend, Jeannette, found this gem. Being tourists in Boston, it was semi difficult to avoid the traps like the Old Union Oyster House (I think that's the name), so discovering lesser known, more affordable, and more delicious places is a game Jeannette and I love to play. Located in the North End, Neptune Oyster house is small and a little more hidden than other seafood joints in the area. Once we walked in, a regular exclaimed, ""Excellent choice!!"" and proceeded to recommend some of his favorites from the seafood bar and menu. We ordered raw oysters, clams, and crab. Jeannette loved the riverrock oyster. The Lobster roll was amazing as were the spicy fried mussels. Whoa, I'm salivating as I type. All I know is that once I move to Boston, I have got to be careful not to make this place a habit -- seafood is pricey! check out more of the menu and fair costs on neptuneoyster.com",5,8/7/2005,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
601,"You know when you read a wine description with ntoes of ""fruity"", ""smooth"", "" full-bodied""?  Well that's what Neptune and Oysters does here but with osyters.  Never thought I would try a oyster with a watermelon finish but it actually had that flavor.  Great place if you want a WIDE variety of oysters,, fresh seafood and a reasonable wine list.  The oysters go for $2 a pop so watch the tab as it can be fun to keep trying the different varieties.  Not a lot of seating, no reservations are taken and the AC is not enough during the brutal days of summer!",4,8/18/2005,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

603,"I'm not an oyster-fan so I can't do justice to this tiny little North End hole with the amazing fish. I took my father (a HUGE oyster affecionado) there for Father's Day last year and he went crazy. He swears Duxbury oysters are the best in the world and that he's never had bigger, better ones than at Neptune. As for me I had a creative ceasar and a fish dish that practically made me cry, it was that good.   However, tiny and crowded are the operative words (as with more North End) haunts, so be prepared.  Oh I almost forgot - amazing wine list as well! You need good wine to accompany your fish, no?",5,2/21/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
604,"I personally don't need aphrodisiacs as I'm ALWAYS in the mood (aka horny), but everyone needs a raw bar fix every few weeks and this is the place to go.  It makes Legal Seafood's darn right illegal for what they serve (I still love you Uncle George!); they have some of the best selections of clams, scallops, and of course oysters around.  The space is cramped, but people are happily slurping away, elbow to elbow.  It makes for a great second or third date place because you really have to sit close to each other and with all the careless, accidental touching of knees and elbows and all the slurping noises and romantic vibes, well...who knows what it could lead to...  Neptune's is definitely a place any self-proclaimed foodie cannot miss.  Two words, three syllables:  Wellfleet Clams!  Booyah...",5,6/19/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
605,"YES YES YES!!!After a long, sun soaked, cold watered, overly drunk, baby hat stealing day at Singing Beach at Manchester-by-the-Sea, a crew of us emerged from the commuter rail, on to a four person pedaled bike and ended up in North End. Surrounded by gaggles of tourists in the hot sun, we ended up at Neptune thanks to Angel's gentle guidance. The restaurant is small but not that cramped-there was a cool simple long bar that I would totally sit at with one other person. Our table was clean, almost kitchen like and we got to sit next to the open door since it is under-air conditioned. With families in their suburban dressed best, we plopped down with sand in our breasts and I am sure reeking of alcohal and ocean and giant bags of wet towels and everyone was cool with it. We each got to pick oysters from a long list like when you order sushi, and the prices can start to rack up. But I had never really had oysters before (only started eating seafood about a year ago) but I was in a very special place. Served on a large plate of ice and two kinds of sauce, I also ordered a very simple large shrimp cocktail for myself. I loved one so much, the Nova Scotia one I think, I ordered one more for myself and they served on a tiny little plate of ice and wedge of lemon-god I just love small miniture things! I also shared the PEI Mussels with Angel and they were damned tasy-recommend getting hot bread to sop up the buttery sauce (although I still love Central Kitchens Mussels the best). We ordered some kind of peach nectar and champagne drinks, and the eel and yellowtail salad one woman had was amazing (like sushi...in a salad!) and another one had a real delicate salmon salad that hit the spot.The waitresses were totally chill and competentant. I thought about coming here again just the night after. My god. I cannot wait to come again!",5,7/3/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
606,"Three of us went to Neptune Oyster on the night that Italy won the world cup, so the waitstaff was still recovering from the celebrations that had happened there that day.  Nonetheless, we were able to snag a table in this little place and we enjoyed a really wonderful dinner.  The oysters were fresh and tasty, with interesting takes on condiments and sauces.  Shrimp cocktail was good.  I had the cold lobster roll - very good.  My fiancee had the hot lobster roll - even better.  The other person in our party got a sandwich that included some kind of fish and also roasted veal.  The roasted veal looked and tasted a lot like turkey, but apparently it was pretty good - I didn't eat any.  Neptune is great if you're in the mood for a splurge - it's pricey.  A great place to bring someone from out of town too, assuming you can get a table.",5,7/13/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
607,"The secret's out that Neptune Oyster is one of the best ""new"" restaurants in the North End.  Their raw oysters are incredibly fresh, though I have a weakness for the tempura-like fried oysters (or clams, or . . .).  They change their menu frequently so I do try to indulge in items other than the fried oysters.  They used to have this crudo- raw and smoke salmon with bits of fried risotto or carnarolli rice, some greens, and olive oil.  It was pure genius!  Worth every penny!",5,7/15/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
608,"UPDATE: Went here last week and tried their scallops that was named the ""Best dish in Boston"" by Boston Mag.....I have to agree.  Amazing.  Still one of my favorite spots in the North End.  Upgrade to 5 stars cuz I'm good like that.Do yourself a favor and order the Trident, for $45 you get a huge ice tray full of raw seafood - oysters, cherrystones, littlenecks, mussels, shrimp, crab, and lobster.All the food I had was delicious, and I found the prices to actually be pretty reasonable.  One cavaet however, we dined at 730-8 on a Sunday and they had ran out of about half of all the dishes listed on the menu, for that fact alone Neptune loses one star.",5,7/31/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
609,"Good service, nice atmosphere, very good food, decent wee selection of beers, but pricey.I like the atmossphere in here and all the white tile (which they had before it got sort popular). But, the place is small and can fill up fast, also don't sit at the bar where it curves, everyone walking in the door will be banging up against you, if it's really cold outside, sit all the way down the back!",4,8/12/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
610,"Really enjoyed the oysters. Like someone said, they really do have great variances in subtle flavors, like a wine. The watermelon flavor of one variety was unmistakable. Thought the hot lobster roll wasn't all that, though the fries were good. Too much butter and bread overwhelmed the delicate lobster, though there was plenty of it. Good wine list, Duvel tops the small beer selection. Nice relaxed atmosphere. Pricey. Would go again. Did go again. I really enjoy the raw seafood, but the fried clams weren't all that imo.",4,9/30/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
611,"Our dinner at Neptune began with a standing wait to grab a spot at a shared table.  In any other place, this annoyance would not be so easily remedied by grabbing a glass of wine at the bar, but the sparkling number that we decided on was so delicious that it both made us more patient and whetted our appetites.I couldn't figure out the appeal of the oyster crackers that were placed on our table before the food came out, so I just ordered another glass of wine.  This turned out to be a good decision, as I ended up reaching the perfect state of ""enlightenment"" with which to fully enjoy the variety of flavors in the oysters.  I highly recommend that you look over the drink menu; it really adds to the meal.  The food itself is so divine that a little bit can go a long way, which is a good thing because it sure is pricey.  We ordered a plate of oysters and the caviar toast with pancetta and salmon mousse special.  Yes, the combination of slimy oysters, salty eggs and whipped fish sounds a bit too...um, aquatic...but it really was one of the most delicious meals I have had in a long time.The atmosphere is crowded but comfortable.  I seem to remember black and white tiles and marble, which somehow still managed to be cozy.",5,10/23/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
612,"We arrived at around 3 PM on a Saturday and were seated right away. Apparently it's tough to get a table at peak hours, so this was perfect.To start off we tried a dozen different oysters and much like with wines, they all had distinct  flavors and textures. The oysters were so fresh that I didn't have a need for helpings other than lemon, although their shallot vinaigrette is delicious.As an entree I had the cioppino which was finger licking good, although a little on the salty side - and I don't mind salt. However, the langostinos were very fresh and the rice was perfectly cooked, which is a little tough to pull off with this dish.The service was prompt and attentive even after it started filling up. Neptune definitely pays attention to detail, you even see this in the pearly gloss surface of their beautifully printed business cards.",5,11/19/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
613,"After waiting, for months it seems, to try this place, I finally went last night. I'm so glad--it was indescribable. Our selection of oysters were very, very fresh and delicious (save for the Fanny Bay oysters which naturally tastes like cantaloupe, blech!)--and the entrees were equally unbelievable. I got a pecan-crusted grouper with shredded pears and jalapenos on TOP of sweet potato puree and marshmallows! My boyfriend got the Tuesday night special--get this--Fried Chicken & Pancakes!!! These were the best pancakes I've ever tasted in my LIFE(with an amazing syrup--it was thinned without being runny, I think they boil the syrup and add butter to it! It was spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon and all that goodness...)and the fried chicken crust was perfectly salted and melted in my mouth.The wine selection was great--I had to have the bartender interpret and recommend a wine--but after I discovered the Bellini menu (written on the wall) I had several of the Blood Orange flavor (tho there's Peach and PassionFruit too!). They were blissful! Champagne and fruit, oysters and fried chicken? Oh my god.",5,11/29/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

615,"I was sadly disappointed. We went here because I have some people that were out of town visiting and because it was my birthday. We tried many of the raw oysters and I wasn't that impressed. The best ones were the ones from Nova Scotia, and the most expensive of course. The cherrystone calms weren't at all sweet, more salty. The waitress kind of messed up our order so we ended up with three fish dishes. I can't remember what they are anymore because it was a while ago but one of them tasted very fishy while the other two were pretty good. Their calm chowder is a lot watery then expected and I feel that they put too much ""crunchy stuff"" and not enough calms. I'm disappointed that they ran out of vanilla lobster and because the waitress messed up we didn't get to try the lobster roll. I also felt that most of the things were too pricey.",3,12/18/2006,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
616,We went to Neptune's on Thursday. What a disappointment. The staff was rude and messed up our order. The oysters where nothing special and the lobster was over priced.

617,"One of a handful of Boston area restaurants to offer an expanded and kick-ass list of a variety of oysters and clams. Try a West Coast oyster next to an East Coast oyster and you'll discover subtle differences in flavors. You'll also understand why their raw menu reads like a wine list, dropping words like ""hints of melon"", ""clean finish"", ""briny flavor"", etc. Tiny downsides: their crudo (""raw"" in Italian) specials, served in small salad form, seems to be getting a little more greasy than when Neptune first opened up. Also, the menu's pricey but other than that this place is nearly perfect. Don't miss their fried offerings; the breading is divinely light.",5,1/15/2007,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
618,"In a word: awesome. I love having a *selection* of oysters. The place gets crowded quickly, and frequently on Friday or Saturday nights there will be a cluster of people trying to get in from the cold without anywhere to go in the tiny room (which can create a rather unpleasant arctic draft when the door is kept ajar). The bf and I like getting there just a little bit earlier than the crowd (around 6ish) and we've never had a problem landing two adjacent seats at the bar. The wait staff is great too, super accommodating. Although we go for the oysters and clams, we occasionally split an entree. I know it sounds a little counter-intuitive, but try their burger. It was juicy and delicious.",5,1/24/2007,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

620,"The oysters are excellent.  They served probably 10 different types, from CT, MA, RI, ME, and WA, along with of course, two sizes of clams on the half shell.   If you are an oyster fan, you will definitely appreciate the freshness and quality (although you are paying the premium).   Had one of the appetizers, the Crab Scampi (basically gourmet lasgnepasta and rich chese with lump crab),  which was very tasty.  However, I couldn't help but asking myself if any  other dish pumped full with the same amount of fat would be just as good...Was not happy with the service at all.  Went around 7pm on a friday with my gf,  hoping to have some raw bar and drinks  before going to dinner at a favorite.  We had to wait 30 minutes to get in, until we were seated in a uncomfortably cramped table which was shared with another couple.  Later on, the waitress made a big deal over the fact that we did not order entrees--- unnappropriate considering our drinks,  raw bar and appetizers alone racked up a  50+ dollar tab.  I understand you are trying to make a f-ing living, but way to make your customers feel unwanted...Can't speak about the entrees firsthand but , other patrons seemed to be pleased with their dishes.Next time I get a craving for oysters, ill buy a couple dozen at the market and shuck'em myself.  Neptune wasn't worth the trip or the dent in the wallet",3,2/5/2007,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

624,"Anyone who knows Boston knows that that North End, Boston's Italian neighborhood, is notorious for it's narrow streets, lack of parking, and great restaurants. Neptune Oyster is one of those great restaurants.The restaurant is tiny with not much of a waiting area. When my wife and I got there, the place was packed. No room for us inside the door so we stood outside and waited.The restaurant is longer than it is wide with an L-shaped booth-like bench stretching along the entire left side of the space and half of the back wall. Several tables were jammed together in front of the bench with chairs on the other side. With seating for twenty-six at the tables and another ten at the bar, which ran along the right side of the restaurant, this place might be considered large by some North End standards. The very front of the restaurant, just inside the etched glass window fronting the sidewalk, was the raw bar where J and I watched the show. Rows and rows of shellfish, and a woman shucking oysters like she was pouring water into a glass. Smooth, effortless, perfect.After about ten minutes outside and another twenty minutes inside, we sat down at a table. J and I started our night off with two glasses of NV Borgo Magredo Prosecco and a dozen oysters. Four Wellfleet, medium sized, salty, and sweet; four kumomoto, small, sweet, plump, and creamy with hints of cucumber; and four Fanny Bay, medium sized, plump, low salt, sweet, and buttery with a melon finish. Neptune Oyster has a dozen different oysters to choose from as well as little necks, cherry stones, and shrimp cocktail braised in Harpoon beer.Moving on to course two, we shared Neptune's Bottarga Salad. Bottarga is cured fish roe and is delicious. This salad was fantastic with Boston lettuce, red grapes, fennel, caramel onions, white anchovy, grape seed oil and a Parmesan dressing.With dinner we drank a bottle of Carpe Diem Chardonnay from the Firepeak vineyard in Edna Valley, California. J ordered Neptune's Gloucester Cod Loin served with stewed tri peppers, oregano, mustard, freshly grated horseradish and a grapefruit vinaigrette. The plate was garnished with supremes of grapefruit.I ordered the Fillet of Salmon with a saute of crispy duck, pea tendrils, avocado, ginger and soy. Both of our entrees were truly spectacular, but J's cod loin dish may very well be the best dish of the year. The cod was cooked to perfection and the spicy horseradish was balanced so well by the sweet, tart grapefruit, the mustard and the oregano. The cod dish was definitely the star of the meal.Now for the best part of the evening. We return to the car to find a carefully placed PARKING TICKET on the windshield! Sometime between the last time I was in the North End and last Friday night, Hanover Street converted all the on-street parking to Residents Only after 8pm.Oh well. Neptune Oyster is awesome and worth a parking ticket. I'll make sure not to park on Hanover Street the next time I go.",5,4/12/2007,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

I  can't wait to go back to this place.So why the 4 stars instead of 5? The place cannot seem to find a manager with the good sense to stock them well enough for a weekend nights. Three times I have gone there (and twice that another friend went) they were out of lobster rolls by 6pm. Come on people - figure it out.

634,"Super cute oyster bar.  Kind of a European feel.  Unfortunately, I didn't think the food was all that great--especially considering the priciness.  The one standout was the crab louis salad--a heap of luscious crab, lightly dressed with almond vinaigrette on tender Boston lettuce.  Disappointing clam chowder (watery and missing the rich clam flavor), although the homemade (?) oyster crackers were a nice touch.  Shrimp cocktail was delicious but absurdly expensive ($3+ for ONE shrimp!),and the lobster roll was wayyy overdressed with mayo.  Most vexing of all, I think the oysters weren't as fresh as some others that I've tasted at Turner Fisheries and Bouchee.   But then again, I will admit that we visited on a Sunday, so they probably didn't have the freshest supply.  I would return just because it's so darn cute, but keep it simple with a glass of prosecco and a couple oysters on the half shell at the bar.",3,7/28/2007,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
635,"The food gods have guided me for years and my third visit to Neptune was testament to their power.  After a long day of moving daughter out of BU (the moving in review is below) I was exhausted and left her to party with her friends.  Upon returning to the Park Plaza I surveyed the neighborhood and resigned myself to eat at Legal Seafood (just some fish and white wine I kept telling myself, how can they screw that up?).  As I was walking toward the door a couple passed me and I overheard this comment:  ""I have been tricked into going to Legal Seafood three times and each time it sucked""....This was a message to go forth and find dinner.  I started walking through the Theatre District and then passed the common without purpose when it hit me, I was heading to North End and a return to Neptune Oyster.  And I was rewarded.Sitting at the bar with cordial service (not cloying but friendly enough) and  a good local ale I started with a grilled sardine, yes one large grilled sardine, over a slice of pancetta with wedge of iceberg lettuce and blue cheese dressing and did it work.  The main was a local bass over a perfect succotash (fresh peas, green beans, and a touch of pancetta) topped with a light vinaigrette.  Every ingredient shined and the flavors weren't buried by unnecessary saucing.Really enjoyed the glass of brocheto (I think that is what they called it) for dessert, a slightly sweet Italian sparkler and walked home to the hotel a happy satisfied customer.I can't agree more with the other reviewers, this place a gem and the third time was the charm.  I try not to return to restaurants but I will be going back to Neptune.  Sure, it is a little rough around the edges, if you want to be coddled, go somewhere else....And 9 months ago.....We hit the Neptune Oyster bar twice in two days, once for dinner with the hon and then for lunch the next day with hon an daughter freed from her orientation at BU and starving.Dinner first.  Got to sit next to wife, always a plus, clam chowder was very good lots of clams and agree with Jenny, the home made oyster crackers were great.  I also agree that $3 a shrimp is very steep as was the chowder ($11).  Still the oysters were wonderful and we left full and content although I admit as someone not from the area the lobster roll (hot) left me confused.  The brioche was knockout though.Lunch was equally pricey, I was stunned at the $10 fruit/champagne cocktails, not the quality but the price of these drinks.    The chowder at lunch was a bit salty and while I could forgive it at a lesser price for that money the chowder has to be perfect.  We spent over 100 on soup, salads and drinks....So the atmosphere is five stars and the wine list is solid and the food is four stars but because of the price structure it just slips it down to three.",5,7/30/2007,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
636,"So I will start this review out by saying that I did not eat at this restaurant. With that said, I was surprised that with a 4.5 star rating this restaurant felt just about as claustrophobic as an overcrowded closet space. I had to scoot my seat in twice in the few minutes I was there to let people through the main entrance - the proportions of which seemed more fitting for a back exit! Decor doesn't seem to be their thing either. I was surprised by tables and chairs that were more fitting for a diner than a fine seafood restaurant.Then there was the problem of their poor supply of seafood. They were out of lobster meat even though it was only 6:30 on a Saturday evening! Now I don't know about you, but the North End probably receives the greatest bulk of its patronage on a Saturday evening and they're telling me there's no more lobster?! The hostess was not all that polite either and didn't show up until after we decided to finally seat ourselves after standing, waiting and ultimately feeling ignored by everyone that seemed like they worked there.While I'm sure the food has much to offer given the rave reviews, I must play devil's advocate and say that until Neptune gets a better floor plan, learns how to more effectively match their food supply to the demand of North End patrons - the inclusion of cocktails wouldn't hurt either - and give their customer service a major overhaul I will have to rate this as I would any other sub-par restaurant, 2 stars. If you expect good service, comfortable eating conditions and a fully stocked menu Neptune is not for you.",2,8/19/2007,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
637,"I ended up here on a whim friday night and boy was it memorable. My friend and I were sorta hungry and wandered in around 7pm. The place was fairly full but there happened to be two seats at the bar so we sidled up.The decor of this place is great. Its cozy, timeless, tasteful it feels vintagey and european, carefully detailed but simple and understated.My experience here was nothing but positive. The bartender was incredibly sweet and totally laid-back for friday night dinner scene. She excitedly relayed the recent celebrity clientele Justin Timberlake and Kate Hudson, but was decidedly as polite and friendly to us as I'm sure she was to them.We felt no pressure to order an abundance of food or to drop wads of cash.  We sampled oysters all excellent, that came via a handy and descriptive menu, location, price, flavor profiles for each type. My friend got the veal and tuna tartare sandwich an unlikely combo, it was awesome served on toasted brioche with a grainy mustard, cucumber salad and solid fries. I literally pored and lingered over the menu, everything sounded delicious. There were tons of unusual flavor profiles, food combinations and several cuisine influences. Far from standard seafood house options.I decide on squid diavola which was grilled and then stewed in a spicy delicious tomato sauce with beans and isreali couscous. I would definitely go back here with more of an appetitie so I could really eat my way through the menu. For an unplanned Friday night this was by far the most memorable meal of the summer, not bad for wandering off the T after work.",5,8/21/2007,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
638,"A favorite neighborhood spot of ours, Neptune Oyster rarely disappoints.  The oysters are fresh and delicious but expect to be shoulder to shoulder with other diners.  It's not a spot for a quiet, romantic dinner but rather a fun night out spent sitting at the wine bar and enjoying the seafood.  Last night, a rainy Tuesday evening, we sauntered in around 7pm and were fortunate to find a nearly deserted bar.  The bartender quickly took our drink orders - favorites from the beer & wine list that we've discovered on other visits -  a glass of the Pigato white wine for me (a delicious Italian light, dry white) and a Whale's Tale Pale Ale for my husband.  A few oysters followed.  Our tried and true favorite is the Island Creek which we mixed with 2 less familiar names.  Neptune serves what is fresh and in season so there is always a new mollusk  to sample.  After drooling over it on other visits, my husband had the Neptuneburger and was it delicious.  Served on a brioche bun and topped with a fried oyster and garlic aoli, it's filling and I was lucky to have a quarter of it land on my plate!  I had the Crab Louis Salad (over butter lettuce with a nutty vinaigrette) and it was also good.  It must have had over a pound of crab on it.  On other visits, I've ordered the cioppino which is also a good choice and the lobster roll is full of big chunks of meat.  Neptune has certainly been ""discovered"" since we first dined there but my fingers are crossed that they never expand and stay true to their oyster/wine bar charm!",4,9/12/2007,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
639,"Oh. My. Gawd. I was pretty blown away by this place last night. It was as if some higher power created a restaurant just for me (except it would serve beer... guess not everything can be perfect). They have an oyster list that's just as extensive as their wine list, and I wanted to try one of each... unfortunately, I only have so much money, so I only ordered a few of them. Each oyster was even better than the last. I was trying to find a favorite, but it's like asking a parent to pick their favorite kid. It can be done, but you just don't want to have to make that choice.I had the neptune burger after my sampling of oysters, and it was amazing. A big, beefy burger topped with fried oysters? YES PLEASE. Not too bad for $13 either (It was the cheapest entree item on the menu. Order anything else and expect to pay at least double that... but know that it will be worth it, no matter what it is). I also tried a little bit of my friend's lobster roll, and whoa mama! I want to live here and eat oysters all day long. Is that okay, Neptune Oyster?***EDIT*** I just went again this weekend, and they DO serve beer!!! They just don't have them listed on the menu, but they're right there on the bar in full view (unless the place is packed with people, which it usually is because it's so tiny).

643,"This review covers two restaurants, namely B&G Oysters and Neptune Oysters, and only one dish at each of these restaurants, namely their lobster rolls.  Why, my dear friends, would I go to these two places with the sole purpose of trying out their respective takes on this classic New England dish?  Because it's a crap-load of lobster on a bun... that's why.With that said, the styles of these two lobster rolls are completely different:  warm and buttery vs. cold and mayonnaise-y.  Obviously, the cold version is the ""classic"" lobster roll, and there has been a plethora of posts about how a warm roll is akin to going to the Democratic National Convention and proclaiming that George Bush Jr. is the best president ever.  I have never been a traditionalist, so I am reviewing these dishes for what they are.First the similarities:1. You get a lot of lobster... not just enough to fill the bun, but enough to REQUIRE eating a good number of fork-fulls before picking the damn thing up and trying to take a bite out of it.  Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way, and ended up spilling about a tail's-worth of lobster meat onto my plate when I tried to take a bite from the get-go.2. Each goes really well with a beer, preferably something that can stand up to the natural butteriness of the lobster meat.  I suppose you could get a nice acidic white, but a nice New England draught (Geary's Winter Ale at Neptune and Tremont Ale at B&G) seemed like the perfect accompaniment to me.Differences:1. B&G:  cold lobster in a light aioli with lemon and chives sprinkled on top.  The lemon gave the dish the perfect amount of acid to balance the lobster.  Not really mayonnaise-y at all.  Lobster chunks broken up to just the right size so when you take a bite out of the roll, you don't have to chew through a piece of lobster or get an overly large piece in your mouth.2. Neptune:  warm lobster in butter on a toasted brioche bun.  The warmth allowed me to fully enjoy all the natural (and added) butteriness of the lobster.  Often times large chunks of lobster that were obviously crab or tail meat.  While a bit harder to eat, the large chunks gave me the impression that there was some dude in the back who cracked open a fresh lobster, chopped it up a bit, put it in the bun and splash some butter on it.The service in each place was great.  The decor was a bit different, with Neptune sporting marble tables and an old-school oyster bar feel, while B&G had a more modern touch with a nice open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant where you can watch them do their magic.Both of these places are must-go's, even if you only like lobster a wee little bit.  I'll be back next time I'm in town, but I think I'll bring some cholesterol-lower medications just in case...",4,11/9/2007,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

Ordering the oysters from the checklist is the way to go, for people like me, who have never had an oyster before. The hot lobster roll is seafood heaven! The lobster meat was so tender and buttery, not to mention the generous amount they give you. I don't really care for french fries, but these fries were so tasty and delicious. I didn't see beer on the menu, but I asked the waitress if they served it. She was very nice in describing a few beers that I was unfamiliar with. Overall, this was a very pleasant experience and I would go back again in a heartbeat.

The prices here are very reasonable, I don't get where people get off in saying it's too expensive, I mean have any of you who are complaining ever purchased and prepared a lobster from a grocery store?  They are expensive, difficult to deal with, and it is time consuming.  For $24 you get about 1-2 lobsters worth of meat perfectly prepared, anybody who thinks that is too expensive needs to stick to the McDonald's $1 menu because that seems to barely be within your budget.",4,5/30/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

I think I had the wellfleet but it was a bit salty instead of fruity, like their check off menu suggested. So wish I took a pic of the list of the oysters. All the dishes were excellent. The only wish is that maybe the lobster roll is cheaper ($24).

664,"Small busy place that seats about 25-30 people including the bar.  The service is certainly not rude, but no smiles either.  However The OYSTERS were fantastic, and very faily priced, not only the selection was great and fresh, it almost seems as though the Oyster Technician personally selected them!!  The appetizers were good but nothing to write home about.  This is a great little place for oysters and it's tucked inside of northend.  Parking is non-existent.",4,6/5/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

666,"despite having been up in boston for the good portion of a year, i am only now beginning to explore the seafood (esp. lobster) offerings this town has. went to neptune on a monday evening hoping to grab a table. unfortunately, this place is super small! there are maybe 5-6 tables in the place plus a bar for seating. we ended up at the bar nevertheless. a long marble countertop which was pretty close to the tables...so the one thing to watch out for if you choose the bar is the wait staff brushing you throughout the night.the menu is simple. interestingly they have weekly specials and on monday night that would be the lobster spaghetti. we ordered a round of fresh oysters from the lady behind the bar...you select them off a listing (similar to some sushi bars) - each having its own taste description (fruity, etc.). the waitress was very knowledge-able and helped us choose 3 types to sample. all the oysters were extremely fresh.next, onto entrees - we ordered the daily special and a lobster roll.  the lobster spaghetti was not too flavorful, the marinara sauce wasn't seasoned enough...we ended up just picking at the lobster bits. the big hit? the 'warm' lobster roll (which you could also get cold) - soooooooo goooood!!! i would venture to say it's up there as one of my faves (at $24, it's a bit steep).",4,6/11/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

668,"Lunch today was my first time here and I was pleasantly surprised.  Neptune is a very small place, only 10 tables or so and a bar where you can also eat.  The menu is short and simple, but the food is outstanding and done very well.  They have a wide variety of oysters from all over to meet just about anyones taste.  The lobster rolls were to die for, the bread was soaked in butter and they are not skimpy on the lobster meat!  I also recommend the veal and tuna tartar sandwich, it was not what I was expecting, but man was it excellent!I will definitely post more when I go back for diner in the future, this was a great find!",5,7/2/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
669,"I was in in Boston over the 4th of July weekend visiting a friend who lives in the North End.  We were both craving oysters, and she has eaten at Neptune before, so we decided to try B&G oysters.  But alas, it was closed on a Saturday night for the holiday weekend (WTF???)  So we hopped back into a cab and arrived at Neptune at about 8:30PM.  The place was packed, but because we were only a party of two they were able to squeeze us in after only waiting about ten minutes.  I loved the atmosphere, it is pretty old school with tiled walls and a tin ceiling.  It was incredibly loud and cramped inside, but I really didn't mind.  We ordered a bottle of Prosecco, and the Tritan plateau, which the waitress said was perfect for two people.  It consisted of 6 oysters, 3 little necks, 3 cherry stones, 6 mussels, 3 jumbo shrimp, and crab cocktail and lobster cocktail.  IT WAS SO GOOD.  I don't think I have ever have had seafood that was so fresh.  We inhaled the whole thing, and then ordered 1/2 dozen kumamoto oysters.  It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  Some might complain that it was a bit pricey, but in my opinion it is worth the price.  I would definitely eat here again.",5,7/7/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

672,"""The gods of the sea have spoken""I love fresh shellfish and when I vacation in New England I simply cannot have it often enough.We have passed Neptune Oyster on many occasions traveling through the North End in search of the Italian restaurants but this time we decided to stop in. The wait is always forty-five to sixty minutes and you can always check out the many little shops in and around Neptune while you wait, as I can not stand waiting in line and in this case waiting out on the street in front of the restaurant because this is a VERY small place.The interior is very tight and if not sitting at the bar you sit at a long communal table but the surrounding conversation is usually very entertaining. The one page menu features the seafood they are noted for and the wine list is very extensive. Now let's eat!We started with the PEI mussels and OMG this was the most fantastic preparation of mussels ever. Cooked with toasted garlic, fennel, trebbiano wine, sausage, caraway seeds and cream. Way beyond amazing, I almost picked up the bowl and drank. Ask for extra bread to sop up the juices.We also had a wonderful fresh selection. Check the black board to see what came in on the boats today.On to the mains, I ordered the North End Cioppino and Robert ordered ""hamburger""! I can never understand the ordering of meat in a seafood restaurant but alas it came to the table topped with fried oysters!! The Cioppino was a wonderful seafood stew a little on the spicy side with lots of grilled seafood and was amazingly fresh and delicious served with saffron rice.With so many other seafood selections to choose from, a think a return trip to Neptune Oyster is a must.(July 11, 2008 Friday)",4,7/27/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
673,"So. Many. Oysters... oysters galore!I can't believe as recent as one year ago I was still anti-oysters. Talk about acquiring new tastes! The place was great. I was visiting from SF and going to try out Neptune Oyster was the only thing on my must-do list. The oysters were fresh, the crudo plates were a B+ (hard to compare to Bar Crudo here in SF) and the lobster roll was good. I really regret not getting the warm version. It was 95+ degrees outside, so I thought going with the cold version would be a better idea. But I hear the warm one is better.Friendly service and atmosphere...",4,7/31/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

678,"I've been waiting 4 days to write this review hoping I might think of something clever to say but alas, I got nothing. This was the 6th or 7th time I've been to Neptune and by far my least favorite. I was even there with my best friend from junior high who moved away and was back for a visit for this one night only, and it was still only okay. We didn't even have to wait for a table and it was still only okay. We split the Neptune shellfish platter among 4 of us and it was really good. Lots of stuff on it (lobster, crab, shrimp, mussels, littlenecks & oysters). But, there weren't that many oysters & the boys ate them up right quick, so I didn't even get to have one. For my meal I had the tuna ribbons Crudo, which I know I have had before and loved. It was having an off-night last week. I do not remember them using a creamy dressing on it before? I hate creamy dressings and I really hate them with seafood. I didn't think Aioli was supposed to be creamy? Anyway, the wine was good. But there was a line of people waiting for tables and our waiter sort of gave us the heave-ho so I had to suck down my 3/4 full glass in one sip. All in all, I think it was just a case of my ordering wrong but after this night at Neptune I didn't leave with that dreamy ""I heart Neptune"" feeling that I usually get.",3,9/22/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
679,"We came here last weekend for a celebratory dinner and arrived at around 6:30. We were seated promptly but with a bit of attitude from the waitress (there's not really a host here). An annoying thing about this restaurant is how cramped it is; even though you can get your own table for 2, it's pushed against another table for 2, so basically your party of 2 will be a party of 4, except you just won't know the other two people there. We didn't particularly like the mother and daughter sitting next to us with their snooty air and got especially ticked when they ate about 3 freaking clams from their entire appetizer and left the rest to be tossed. So wasteful... We had those clams in the wine and garlic broth as a starter, and wow were those good. Nice, garlicky, with a bit of sand in the clams but not too much to notice it terribly. I loved the broth; wish we had more bread (we got only got 2 tiny pieces of bread, AFTER asking our waitress, and then we asked for another helping) to sop up that clammy goodness. We also had the oysters, of course.. I can't remember all of them, but I do remember that we had the kumamoto and the pemasquid. This was my first time having raw oysters, and while they were very fresh and tasted interesting (sorry, this lack of detail is due to my lack of oyster experience), I'm not sure I'd want to get them again. We then shared the cioppino and the lobster roll. The cioppino had too much heat in it; yes, on the menu it says it's spicy, but I really don't think the average person can take that much heat. I can tolerate slightly more than the average person and so can my boyfriend, but we both agreed that if they had to make it spicy to give options to diners if they wanted it mild, medium, or very spicy. Kind of ridiculous. But the lobster roll was DELICIOUS -- we had it hot with butter in a roll (how else can you have a lobster roll?), and there was a very generous amount of lobster. All the seafood we had that night was fresh. The service, though, is something I was really upset about. From the moment we walked in we could tell the waitress had an attitude problem. She gave us a dirty look while we were getting seated, and in addition to that, she explained the sides and specials to the table next to us but didn't let us know that we had those options as well. And then, she also didn't give us the full wine list, but she DID do that for everyone else around us. I didn't even realize it until I noticed that all the other tables around us had one more menu than we had, and this was after we already ordered our drinks. We wondered if this may have happened since we were the only non-Whites in this restaurant... well, we could never really prove it. Our main courses also took a very long time to come; we probably spent over an hour waiting for them to come, which is really unacceptable. This isn't some large restaurant where several hundred people are being served. We asked the waitress if our dishes were coming, and she had this agitated look on her face and insisted they were coming. They didn't come for another 20 minutes after she said that. While the food was great and the seafood fresh, I'm still hesitant about coming here again because of the poor service and the long wait for the main courses. That waitress really needs to get her panties out of a bunch.",3,9/27/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
680,"I think the fact that we went on a rainy night increased our chances for getting a table for 5 without much wait on a friday.  It was crowded, but we only waited a few minutes to sit down.  I take this as something of a feat from other yelp reviews.On to the food, the consensus was mostly delicious and a little pricey, but worth going back for a special occasion.  The extensive raw bar was delightfully fresh and well-priced, a definite treat.  The clam chowder was good - much lighter and more complex than the usual thick and hearty style, but perhaps not worth the $11 price tag.  Another appetizer, the grilled squid over polenta, looked fantastic and could serve as a main entree if you're not too hungry.The trout on the menu right now is wonderful - crispy corn crust, generous portion of perfectly cooked fish, and a light but sweet blueberry sauce as a contrast, enhancing the asparagus and whipped parsnip accompaniments, as well as crab hush puppies.  The cioppino looked decent, although being from San Francisco, I have very high standards, and a friend who got the lobster roll (not surprisingly) raved.  I was sad the lobster clam bake was priced so high ($55!), way out of my range for a casual dinner with friends.Nice wine list, good beers, and a pleasant experience.  The food wasn't mind-blowing, but it was incredibly fresh and well-made, and the prices were a little higher than expected, but not a complete rip-off.  Definitely a worthy option for high quality seafood, just keep your expectations reasonable and your wallet stacked.",3,9/28/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

If you are into oysters the staff are especially helpful and forthcoming with their recommendations and expertise (the fanny bay oysters really do have a cucumber finish- unbelievable!).If the thought of eating raw shellfish turns your stomach inside out, I've heard that their cooked offerings are just as amazing.

683,"A very delicious raw bar indeed.  Now, this is a very small space.  Smaller than Taro Sushi even. You're literally squeezing between north and south oriented bars tools and seats just to get to the tables, bathrooms and exit. No reservations are taken and my guess is you'll be playing musical chairs like one plays musical pizzas at DiFara in Brooklyn.  On to the food.  Each oyster is intense and distinct in flavor.  The kitchen food is a different story, it's not horrible but IMO it's too expensive for what it is.  Creative but certainly way too mellow (ie bland).  Oysters seem to go for an average of a $1.50 a pop no matter where they're from.  Pretty damn good for what you get.  Follow those with a Whale Tail Pale Ale and you're doing well.So, between the very briny oysters and equally briny beer, the ambiance and antique decor, the lack of bad attitude from the servers, all this more than makes up for the space and kitchen food hassle.  In fact all of this combined has a nice calming effect.  Something very rare in a city where it's nowhere near the population of the Big Apple and yet you have less elbow room and certainly crazier drivers.

MMMMMM !!!!Several orgasmic food things can be found on Neptune's menu, including (explanations below): + Clam Chowder                          11.00 + Oysters                                        2.30 to 2.80 ea + Sweet Potato Puree                  part of a 31.00 entree + Warm Buttered Lobster Roll   25.00CLAM CHOWDERMilky, not over-creamed, clean crisp taste if you ever thought that was possible of a chowder, definitely not your traditional version, but had all the classic ingredients (clam chunks, potatoes, cream).  Something about the underlying flavor of this dish ROCKED my world.  Perhaps an extra concentrated lobster broth?  Salsify?  What is it??OYSTERSFlying Point, ME - HUGE shell, big and meaty with an earthy mushroom finish; Pemaquid, ME - medium in size with a citrus finish (definitely accurately described by Neptune staff); Sunnyside, PEI - medium in size, mild flavor with a rush of sake at the end (boo-yah!).  My fave was definitely Flying Point.  In my mind, the bigger the better!  And at $2.3 ea, it was a great deal, too!  Pricing the individual oyster is the way to go.  Neptune is king at that.SWEET POTATO PUREEThis special item came with Saturday's special of pork 'n clams.  It was prepared this time with two thick pork chops served over a dollop of the puree and all of this topped with fried clams and julienned apple slaw.  This whole dish was divine, might I add, but the puree was something to behold.  Sweet potato, you think, sweet.  But not this time.  It's sweet was cut with some mystery savory thing and it was light and umami-licious!  A bowl of that stuff aside my lobster roll would put me over the edge!  Speaking of which ...WARM BUTTERED LOBSTER ROLLIf you love lobster, you must get this dish!  Don't be swayed to trying other thingers, because this dish will get your libido rolling!  It's not an impressive size but when has size mattered in life...?  *shrug*  The warm version must be opted for over cold, since, where else can you get a warm lobster roll except in CT??  It's served with thick cut fries (hardly worthwhile).  Ah, but the meat of the lobster is nice and cut into mouthful sized pieces where you can tell which piece is from the tail, knuckle, and claw.  It's drizzled with warm butter which soaks right into the roll.  And all together: salt, butter, meat, and soft roll with a slight char ... WOW I was in heaven!  I consider myself a picky lobster eater but I will return over and over for this treasure.Other things to consider: + The restaurant is small.  The bar is reserved for diners not waiters.  Expect to wait.  There are no reservations. + Some of the other entree options weren't up to par with the flavors of the dishes described above.   + The Vitello Tonnato was bland and difficult to eat.   + The mussels, though very well prepared, were over-dilled.  I'd say stick with the fronds and root, but forget about the seeds. + The salmon was unimpressive in size and cooked quality.  Perhaps slightly over-cooked. + TRY the special for the night.  This isn't your restaurants leftovers.  Think: fresh catch/in season.I SHALL RETURNAll in all, I can't wait to return to try all of the offerings and/or gorge myself in beautifully shucked oysters all day and paired with a Whale's Tale or Geary's Pale Ale.",4,10/26/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

688,"small, very specialized restaurant in the heart of what can only be called one of boston's coziest, traditional neighborhoods. the north end has no lack of eateries throughout the ins and outs of hanover and salem streets. however, this restaurant serves up the freshest shellfish i've ever had the pleasure of eating, and i suggest that when you come here, you take a gander at the variety of oysters and shellfish on their mirror board, and order away. sitting at the bar is a good choice too. at a most recent visit, we skipped the entrees and just went nutty on the items on the board. this included pleasant bay oysters from MA, flying point oysters from ME, summerside oysters from PEI, kumamotos from WA, fanny bays from BC, the mussels appetizer (absolutely delicious - caramelized eggplant, sweet peppers, basil pesto swimming in a wonderful briny, buttery broth), and finally, an order of sea urchin (or uni if you're used to seeing this on the menu at sushi joints). just a few tips on ordering: if you're unfamiliar with the different pros and cons of each of the oysters they have to offer, fret not! the lovely server will hand you a cliff notes version of the tastes of each of these oysters. also, i know people are often squeamish about uni/sea urchin. who can blame them as you often get less than fresh, orange, murky mystery snot when ordering at the average sushi restaurant. but neptune oyster serves up sea urchin the way it was meant to be tasted and the way in which it received its reputation as a true seafood delicacy. they will clean and present your order of sea urchin just as they would one of their oysters. live and cleaned in front of you. and you will taste a firm, yet melty, buttery treat. i urge you to try it here, even if you've dismissed it in your past.service was wonderful. the restaurant crowd was filled and boisterous as early as 5:10 pm, so plan on coming early (i don't think they take reservations so otherwise you may have a wait.) and please... order the geary's porter. they have it on tap and it goes incredibly well with the oysters. happy slurping.",5,11/15/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

690,"Give me oysters or give me death!!! Oh how I love Neptune Oysters. Let me count the ways: 1) The menu is perfect and focuses on fresh seafood with an emphasis on tasty oysters. I've had east coast oysters like Malpeques and Blue Points to the west coast varieties like Kumamoto and Fanny Bay. It's all good. 2) Hot lobster roll with butter on a toasted roll. Hot diggity damn do I love this and I'm from Maine! I grew up a lobster roll traditionalist -- lobster, a bit of mayo, and a toasted hot dog bun is what I had considered to be the bomb, but the hot lobster roll at Neptune Oyster is awesome. And for those times when I am feeling a bit traditional they do offer a cold lobster roll with mayo (not as good in my opinion though). 3) Olive oil shallot mignonette for your oysters --hey you are in the North End after all so this mignonette really represents your location. I thought it was weird the first time I tried it, but now I kind of like it. It adds a nice flavor with my oysters. 4) Try their daily specials -- lobster spaghettini, fritto misto, risotto...c'mon this ain't some leftover crap you'd get at most restaurants. Their specials are GOOD and again fresh. They often sell out!! 5) Wine list -- by the glass, by the half bottle, or by the bottle. From fairly inexpensive to much to much for my budget they have a great selection and the staff don't bat an eye if you order the $29 bottle of white or the $100 of red. 6) The staff are really quite unpretentious here which is a rarity. They are friendly and move quickly and are unassuming and make suggestions are the right time. I could keep going, but here is what I recommend you do:Walk to the T. Get on said T and head to Government Center or Haymarket (your choice). Walk from T to the North End, Salem Street to be exact. Go into Neptune Oyster. Order a dozen (to start) of east and west coast oysters. Order a glass of wine or even a bellini. Order a hot lobster roll. Sit back, slurp, drink, repeat!!  Order more oysters.  Have another drink.  Leave very happy!!",5,12/11/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
691,"This place was perfect for the occasion.  We wanted classic, upscale New England seafood in a charming, romantic setting.  Done!  We had been frightened by tales of a long wait, but there were only three other tables occupied when we arrived.  Of course, they only have about eight tables plus the counter, but it was the perfect balance of quiet and cozy with warm and alive.  (This was a cold Sunday evening around 7 pm.)Neither my girlfriend nor I much care for oysters, so we forsook the raw bar in favor of early courses.  She got the famous chowder, and I tried the lobster salad with baby iceberg wedge, grape tomatoes, stilton crumble, crispy pancetta bits, and tarragon vinaigrette.  It felt simply off somehow, as if one ingredient was seriously amiss but the rest all worked together in wonderful symphony.  It may have been either the tarragon or the lobster meat itself.  I tasted the chowder but failed to appreciate the heaps of praise that I had read.  It was rather bland, actually.  We would have liked to have bread or rolls with the salad and soup, but none were offered.Thankfully, the quality of the meal picked up from there.  I ordered one of the daily specials--the Gloucester fisherman's plate, a monstrous assembly of cod, scallops, swordfish, and various shellfish over potatoes and cabbage, with a savory, slightly creamy broth.  Very, very good, especially the cod and scallops.  My girlfriend wanted to eat lighter and ordered the scallops.  Those were some of the best that I've ever tasted.No coffee or dessert at this restaurant:  there are plenty of great bakeries in the neighborhood, and Neptune Oyster knows its niche.  It's a classy but unpretentious, seemingly family-run, establishment.  While we were there, several regulars came in; someone's daughter was sitting at the counter coloring; all that merely contributed to the friendly vibe and did not detract from the upscale warmth.  They open at 11:30 every day and would probably be great for a business lunch.",4,12/16/2008,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

694,"This place is one of my favorite restaurants in Boston.  It is really small, so it can get crowded during the busy times.  I usually go for lunch when there are less people.  Everything that I have had here is really good.  The oysters are always fresh.  For the newbies, they have descriptions of each type of oyster so you can know what you are getting.  The fried clams and lobster rolls are also really good.  The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Oh yeah, and they have a pretty good selection of wine.  Definitely a must try if you are at the North End.",5,1/7/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
695,"People have written such high praise for this place and I will not be deviating from the trend.  Have been on several occasions, however after a great meal last night, I was inspired to write a review.  Yes, it is pricey, however they have a great raw bar selection coupled with a great wine list (with good by the glass options as well) and phenomenal food.  Don't be fooled by a limited menu, this place is a guaranteed good meal.  Had the cioppino last night which was loaded the garlic and saffron - so it had quite a zip to it.  The meal had a wonderfully flavorful broth and the garlic was sliced paper-thin.  If you want a good red, check out the Nero D'Avola.  Our server was well-versed in the wine list and was able to make good suggestions to my friend who was undecided.",5,1/8/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
696,Finally went in with a plan to eat off the rest of the menu and it was great. I took my dad who had never heard of it. He's not an easy critic but left raving about our experience and already planning on taking my mother some time soon. I had the crab cake caprese special and he had a gloucester cod special. We both got a variety of oysters and a few not-so-traditional beers. All of the above were awesome.,5,1/14/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
697,"Incredible first experience for us and our friend visiting from out of town.  With no plans, we decided last minute to venture over to the North End for a late lunch.  We were immediately impressed with the overall look and atmosphere of Neptune Oyster.  We ordered fried clams as an appetizer and a bottle of red to go with our meal.  The clams were perfectly fried and juicy, served with an unique aioli relish.  I ordered a warm, buttery lobster roll for my entree.  My fiance and friend split a plump, monster of a burger topped with fried oysters.  Both were served with fries and extremely satisfying.Other then our wine being just okay, our entire experience at Neptune Oyster was a great way to introduce our friend to Boston.  The dessert wine our server surprised us with was also a nice and thoughtful treat. An excellent place to visit on a chilly winter afternoon for an all around enjoyable experience.Now amongst my favorites!",5,1/20/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
698,"Fabulous food.  Fabulous staff.  The perfect place to pop in for a good dose of seafood and wine or beer.Lobster roll is $25, but it's worth it.  On the advice of our server, we opted for hot with butter (as opposed to cold with mayo) and were not disappointed.Crabcake special was unique and yummy.  I loved the accompanying crab salad with avocado and frisee.Fried clams were perfect.  The house-made tartar sauce garnered raves from all four in our group.Clam chowder was lighter than most, and very flavorful.I skipped the oysters, as I'm preggers, but my friends said they were uber-fresh and tasty.",4,1/25/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
699,"I like to put up 5 star reviews for places that are exactly what I expect, and then they throw in something extra. 'Neptune Oysters: Go expecting an extremely small seafood restaurant that caters to clients with quite a bit of money to blow but don't feel like going to a pretentious restaurant.Charlotte and I were there to get a few oysters (she had only tried them once before, and was told to swallow it whole without chewing... kind of like funneling a 50 dollar bottle of wine, wtf?). Entering I wasn't expecting the place to be that nice or that small, but it is both. We sat down at the bar and ordered a beer. As we looked over the oyster list the food that came out of the kitchen looked incredible.They had an amazing selection, and really simple but descriptive explanations of each on a sheet that resembled a Sushi menu. The prices where what you'd expect at 2-4 dollars an oyster.The order came pretty quick, and the oysters were superbly fresh. I was also given back the order form along with the oysters so I could know which ones we were eating. This was a hugely appreciated, and in my experience unprecedented. I really liked having my cheat sheet as we tried each one.At 27.62 for two beers and 6 oysters it was pricy; but compared to what people around us were ordering, this was a remarkably small order. Neptune clinched its fifth star when my date pointed out that the server wasn't rushing us, even though the place was packed and they would shortly be needing the seats. I was trying to pay before we had finished our beers... the server laughed, and told me to relax.For Oyster lovers, this is a must as far as places to stop. Go on off peak hours because the place is tiny.",5,1/26/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
700,"I had heard that Neptune was great, and I expected great food there. What I did not expect was such a fun and relaxed atmosphere in a place that was at the same time jam packed! A lot of times when you go into the type of place where there is communal seating, and high turnover, there is a rushed feeling... not so at Neptune.I went in with my mom and her friend when they were in town last weekend and we were seated next to a group of gentlemen having a business lunch. Upon arrival our server (Vinny- the best ever) let us know right away that since he was slammed, it was going to be about 10 minutes until he could get to us. Letting us know that ahead of time made it no big deal... We sat down, and he actually got to us in about 5. We had amazing Skip's Island Creek Oysters, and some Kumamotos that were pretty killer too. We tried both the butter and the mayo lobster rolls... both are awesome... The butter one may be a bit more delicious in my opinion, especially during the winter months since it can warm you up, but kudos to the the mayo roll too. It is surprisingly light, as it is far more lightly tossed in mayo than other lobster rolls I have had in the past.We sat and talked with our table mates and Vinny through 2 bottles of wine (great selection), and then Vinny treated us to an appertif (which sadly, I cannot remember the name of) it was dark pink (almost red) and delicious. Sweet, but not too much so, and the perfect end to the perfect meal on a lazy weekend day.I highly recommend spending a long lunch at Neptune to anyone!",5,1/28/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
701,"I joined yelp just so I could talk about my experience at Neptune Oyster.I visited Neptune Oyster for my first (and second) time during my first trip to Boston over Thanksgiving break.  We came to Boston looking for amazingly fresh seafood and lots of local beer and were beyond impressed with Neptune Oyster.  We started the dinner off with the Triton Plateau, their raw bar sampler for 2.  All of the oysters were extremely fresh and their lump crab that came with it was out of this world.  The high point of my night was when the lobster roll came out, however.  Maybe I'm (seafood) sheltered coming from Chicago, but I have never heard of a warm lobster roll.  Imagine a crispy homemade roll, packed full with fresh lobster and then doused in warm butter.  Unbelievable.  I don't know if I was tainted by such a great overall experience, but even the fries were perfect.My friend also had the chowder and said it was one of the best he's ever had.  Nice local beer selection and a fairly reasonable wine list to boot!   We had dinner there Friday and lunch on Monday before taking a flight out.  I will also be back the next time I go to Boston.  It wasn't cheap, but I've never felt better spending a lot of (my own) money!",5,1/31/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
702,"I rely on Yelp for great reviews and Neptune Oyster was perhaps one of the best pointers I've received from the site.Before I had an oyster at Neptune, I didn't even like oysters.  My girlfriend ordered a few and when they were brought out to us, I said something along the lines of, ""enjoy, those are all yours"".She convinced me to give one a try and after that we ordered two more rounds.  They were some of the most delicious things I have ever tasted.  We got one of each oyster, each with a beautiful, unique flavor.  My favorites were the ones with the mineral finish.We also ordered a tomato and oyster soup - fresh, flavorful, and delicious.  Angel got the skate which was stunning.  Even leftover it was fantastic.Before we left Boston for the weekend, we came back for more.  We still talk about our trip to Neptune and will surely go back.",5,2/5/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

Started with super fresh, super delicious assortment of oysters and some very good wine and brought it home with the cod dish described above...simply amazing!The food here is out of this world and the staff is fantastic! Nice, unpretentious environment makes it a superb dining experience.Remains at the top of my list!",5,2/17/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
704,"Wow, this place has excellent oysters and seafood.  I came in for lunch and happened to sit near this guy who was a sort of oyster connoisseur who gave me a little tutorial on the progression of oysters I should eat.  He suggested starting with some west coast oysters (Kumamoto and Island Creek) and then going to a fuller east coast Cape Cod oyster (Wellfleet).  Being an oyster newbie, I gave it a shot and I could definitely see what he was talking about, great stuff.  I then had their famous lobster roll, which was the reason I had originally came after reading about it in so many magazines.  I had it Connecticut style (hot with butter) and it was quite awesome, tons of large lobster chunks falling out of the huge roll.  The only thing I would have liked to do is get a salad instead of the fries it comes with, I don't want to know how many calories that meal had.  :)",4,2/20/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
705,"I heart Neptune Oyster!My hubby and I visited this place twice and each time we are amazed that the food is consistent and you cannot beat the authentic atmosphere, character in the decor everywhere you look.  Our first visit was during a quiet afternoon and our second, a hustlin' and bustlin' weekday evening.  On our last visit, we started off with a round of 8 pairs of select raw oysters, the freshness is amazing!  Accompanied with cold glasses of harpoon IPA. YUM!  Ordered the lobster roll (hot) it was ridiculously good!  So good that, I didn't even like lobster before I had the lobster roll, now I find myself fantasizing about the next occasion that I can spring $25 for something so good I feel guilty after every bite.  Although a little less glam in comparison to the lobster roll, the Neptune Burger was a pleasant surprise for a seafood joint.  A hearty serving of burger topped with fried oysters and let/toma/ketch on a soft & fluffy, grilled bun. *Sigh* till next time...",5,2/25/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
706,"To: The lobster(s) who died a hot and buttery death for my cousin's lobster rollFrom: IanRe: Thank youThank you for your sacrifice. My cousin - who hails from a landlocked Mountain West state and wanted to try a true East Coast specialty - thought you were absolutely delicious. You made the City of Boston proud.# # #Neptune Oyster is the place to go for shellfish. The oyster selection is expansive and well explained. The cherrystone clams were among the largest I have ever seen. The steamed littlenecks were laden garlic and had a smokey, almost porky flavor that I could have eaten forever.I'm less convinced that Neptune is the place to go for fish. My cioppino, while nicely seasoned with a kick, was somewhat unremarkable. The saffron rice was undercooked (I think they meant for the rice to keep cooking in the hot broth after it was brought to the table, but that didn't quite happen). I'm of the opinion that a fisherman's stew should be a messy affair: Neptune's refined interpretation took a little away from the soul of the dish. And there wasn't any lobster. Sadness.Cioppino notwithstanding, the people at Neptune obviously know what they're doing. I'm just happy to find someone else who takes clams and oysters on the half shell as seriously as I do.",4,3/4/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
707,"Very nice restaurant, bit costly but its worth to go there if you are going with guests. Most of the time it is crowded so sometimes you won't get proper service. They decorate the oyster plate very nicely and they also have good selection of oysters. I tried oyster first time in this restaurant After few days, I visited this place again but I didn't got proper service so I started to visit Union Oyster Bar which is cheaper than this place and having a good service.",4,3/6/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
708,"Oh my god! This place was the best! I was in Boston recently and read good things about this place on Yelp, so off we went...not disappointed! Although, I have to admit I've never been to an oyster bar before, so they could be all like this.On our first night at Neptune (yes, there was another visit within our weeklong visit) we were told that the waiting time was 1 hour (the place was packed, the line was long, & they don't take reservations), so we decided to eat dinner at an Italian place up the street (also very good but don't remember the name if I do, more details to follow...) and then come back. We ordered the Triton platter, which came with raw oysters, cherrystone & littleneck clams, steamed (& very sweet!) mussels & tigerprawns, lobster salad & another salad (crab?) + a bottle of white. So delicious!!! Perfect after dinner meal :)The next time we came for lunch and amazingly, there was no one there. We were joined by 3 different groups afterwards though. The atmosphere was more laid back, you could see more of the place, all the details, like I noticed this really old (vintage?) black metal fan on the wall by the entrance to the kitchen, the nice tiles, etc. So the ambiance is really nice, both daytime & nighttime. Lunch was also amazing...tried 6 different types of oysters (the highlights were the kumamoto & I forgot the other type - Pleasant Bay?), clam chowder (very light on the cream, you can really taste the essence of the clams, this was so yum), and tried several appetizers, like hamachi ceviche, scallop spicy ceviche, octopus salad, & crab cakes (kind of Italian stye, it had basil, cheese, tomato...) What was also nice is one can order a bottle of champagne at a reasonable price here (cheapest is $39). Anyway, just simply amazing seafood, lovely ambiance, good service, will go back whenever I'm in Boston.",5,3/8/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
709,"This was one of the top ten meals of my life.  I had the clam chowder and a lobster roll with fries.  The clam chowder was good and tasted really fresh.  The fries were good too.  But the lobster roll....oh my god.  It should be illegal for something to be this delicious.It was succulent, warm, fresh lobster, dripping with butter on a perfectly toasted brioche roll.  It was nothing short of amazing.  Everyone should eat a lobster roll at Neptune at least once in their life.  It was pricey at $25, but worth every penny.The service was great, and they have a huge wine list.  I was very happy with my Chardonnay, and it complemented the food really well.  I will definitely be back, and I recommend Neptune to anyone who travels to or near Boston.",5,3/20/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
710,"Living in St. Louis now, I develop massive cravings for certain things...one of which is a lobster roll.  So when I knew I was coming to town I immediately began both salivating and looking for a place to satiate my need.Needless to say Neptune was up to the task (both cold and hot lobster rolls were great), and I didn't mind the fact that they were $25 apiece.  That said, as good as the lobster roll was, their fried clams might have surpassed it.  Simply the best I've had.  It can't replace the experience of sitting at a picnic table on the cape with your feet dangling in the sand, but good lord they were good.Well played Neptune, well played.",5,3/27/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
711,"Thank you yelpers for this recommendation!  I was in Boston for the weekend (from NY) and only had 1 dinner while in town and chose Neptune to get my lobster roll fix.  I ordered the yellowtail hamachi appetizer and hot lobster roll (I also tried my husband's clam chowder).  My brother in law hated the chowder, but he's a college student from California, so has little frame of reference.  I liked the b/c it was lighter than most chowders I've had and quite flavorful.  I really enjoyed the yellowtail, but the star of the night was the lobster roll.  Buttery, large chunks of fresh lobster, perfectly toasted roll...it was fantastic!  Loved the cozy ambiance, too.",5,4/1/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
712,"Fried Clams. Lobster Chowder. Lobster Rolls (hot and cold). Veal/Tuna Tartar Sandwich. DANG. Party of 3 went on a rainy Saturday for a late (2pm) lunch. Would have gotten some oysters but just could not avoid the other menu offerings.  The fried clams were the best I have ever eaten, and perhaps ever will. Light coating, and practically.. fluffy.. meat. Amazing. These were not your bottom of the barrel clams. The lobster chowder was incredible - with a thick blended veggie base to not overdo you with heavy cream. Local (Verril Farm) ingredients were noticeably fresh.After reading much praise of the lobster rolls, each of those had to be done. So as not to have a duplicate meal, I went with the roasted veal/tartar sandwich. Hot lobster roll - its just like eating a lobster with butter, without any effort. My preference is cold - and it was every bit as delicious, with just the right amount (not much!) of mayo. The rolls were of course a great match - not lame Wonder bread - Neptune's toasty brioche is THE winner here. The veal/tuna exceeded every one of my excpectations. Served on fantastic thick toasty bread, the sandwich was piled high with meat. The cucumber salad and mustard are in there, but only really noticeable when you start chowing down. The coolness and spice work in an amazing way with the crazy fresh tuna and warm, tender roast veal. The sandwiches are all full meals - while served with some delicious fries (really great, dark, crunchy, with skin and nicely seasoned), the sandwiches were filling enough that no one finished their fries.Great service, never pushy and always there to top off your water. I will be back.. and I will be sending many others along.",5,4/14/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
713,"Simply great seafood here. The room is packed a little tight - we sat at the bar. We ordered a dozen oysters from all over the map - each one the pinnacle of freshness and all delicious. Followed up with two lobster rolls, one hot and one cold. Which was better? My wife and I are still debating. The hot tastes like a freshly shelled lobster with drawn butter, the cold is chilled with a very subtle and crisp mayonnaise. I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly.",5,4/14/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
714,"Loved it. My huz used to work with the owner at another Boston restaurant-it is ridiculous it took us five years to finally try it. Food was great, wine list is incredible. A piece of lobster from my roll fell on the ground and I had a moral debate in my head about picking it up and eating it under the ""five second rule"". Only advice go on a Sunday as it is tiny (and beautiful). I have one regret-everyone had this little oyster crackers with butter at their places, but not us. I suppose I didn't need them...",5,4/19/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
715,"Place was good, had a nice selection of beers & raw bar.  Kitchen food was well made and presented nicely.  My only complaint is when I asked the owner where else I could enjoy a good meal in Boston he recommended his own restaurant.  Someone should tell him while his food was good, it wasn't worth going back to back nights when I was only in town for a weekend!  Also... who would ever recommend a patron to come back to back nights to their own restaurant?  That's pretty desperate in my opinion...",4,4/22/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
716,"My husband took me here for our anniversary... and he got huge points. This seafood restaurant is small, but warm and intimate. With a long marble  counter and small tables with dark wood and mirrors it has a wonderful ambiance -- feels almost European. Old jazz was playing softly setting a nice mood. But the service and friendly and knowledgeable staff really put the experience over the top. We chose and compared several types of oysters and they helped pick out a wine to go with our entrees -- and we loved the choices. You can quickly spend a bundle here, but you feel like you got what you paid for unlike some places. It left a very pleasant memory for me and I can't wait to go back.",4,4/23/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

718,"My coworker and I got a ton of different oysters and some raw clams as well.  We also split the lobster roll, naked style.  This is one of the rare places that offers their lobster roll without the mayonnaise dressing.  The generous chunks of lobster were drizzled with warm butter and served up on a warm, fluffy roll, next to a huge order of fries.  Delicious!  It's a bit pricey here, but it's worth the money.  It's a small restaurant, but we just sat at the counter and we were fine.",5,4/30/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

I have never had a sandwich so sinfully delicious or seafoood so sinfully delicious. I would have to say their lobster roll almost beats out my mother's famous lobster thermidor.Oh....how I could just eat that for days.My husband and I wondered into this restaurant over Memorial Day weekend and luckily were able to be seated within 5 minutes.We had their oysters to order which were good, and their made to order clam chowder. However, the lobster roll which is a small whooping $25 worth every penny, was by far the star item for us. We chose to have the hot lobster roll on a warm baguette drenched in a seasoned butter. I mean sinfully drenched. The sandwich was perfect, the bread was light, fluffy, and not too dense. The lobster was tender, not over cooked, and cut into nice bite size chunks. Needless to say, we had to roll ourselves out of the restaurant after all the wine and food. I am so happy this place is not walking distance to us.",5,5/27/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

The place is pretty small and gets packed really quick and the waiting list can get quite long.They had a nice selection of both east coast and west coast oysters. Katama bay was definitely my fav, followed by Waianno and Taylor Bay. You can choose either the cocktail sauce or the other (green) one when ordering the oysters. They were ok, I like it better with just lemon and tabasco. I also got the fried Ipswitch clams which I was told was a very Boston thing to eat. They were ok.

OMG, the most amazing fish tacos. the toasty tortilla with that perfectly fried fish and sauce... plus the slaw accompanying it. when i first took a bite, i was like OMG and passed it around insisting everyone try. if you are there on a sunday, please PLEASE order the fish tacos.  these are fish tacos like no other.  I got two ginormous fish tacos!  so filling, the 2nd one i ended up eating half of the fish without tortilla. lunchtime pick to avoid the line..keep in mind, no high chairs, etc..so if you wanna come w baby, think about what you might be able to do to rectify that issue.",5,6/3/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

728,"I understand that you're a busy, popular restaurant. I understand it was 7:30 at night.  I even understand that there may have been a long wait for a table and I might not have gotten seated that night.  But there is NO excuse for leaving a patron standing in your doorway, completely ignored, for over 25 minutes!Come greet me.  Offer to put my name on a wait list.  Tell me I might not get a table.  Tell me there's a long wait, and the bar is first come, first serve.  Tell me something!  But don't just ignore me and hope I go away.While we did eventually snag a pair of seats at the bar, we never did talk to a hostess or see a wait list, nor did the people who had been standing behind us (they ultimately left in frustration).Once you get a seat, I will admit that Neptune's raw bar is one of the best in the city.  It's quite extensive (albeit expensive), and everything is very, very fresh.  They also have an impressive wine list.However, service does not improve once you're sitting down.  We ordered appetizers and waited about 45 minutes for them.Once they arrived I was also disappointed with the food.  The clam chowder looked wonderful from a distance, but once it hit my spoon I realized it was thin, watery and short on both clams and flavor.I'll grant you that the P.E.I. Mussels Caprese was AMAZING, and I'll highly recommended.I thought the wait for the appetizers was bad, but our food didn't show up for just short of TWO HOURS.  In fact, the three couples surrounding us at the bar all ordered after we did, and they had received and finished their food before we ever received ours (the gal next to me offered me some of her Lobster Spaghettini, probably because my stomach was grumbling so much it shook the bar).I came to Neptune for dinner that night because I wanted a lobster roll, and I heard theirs was the best around.  Conclusion: they're horribly overrated.  The bread came out burnt (literally, the bottom was black) and nearly impossible to eat.  And when I went at the lobster with a fork, I found it was dry and tasted old and slightly sour.And when I was asked, ""how is it?"" and I told them, the bartenders response was, ""Oh,"" and she walked away.  Well, if you don't care how crappy the food is, don't ask.In the end it was a painfully disappointing and expensive night.  I may go back to Neptune for the raw bar, but I'm probably done with dinners there.",2,6/10/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
729,"The lobster roll here is 5 stars, but considering we had to wait an hour to be seated and the prices are not cheap I had to give this place 4 stars.  That being said, I've eaten at many places in the North End and if ever I wanted to go out there again, Neptune's would be my first choice.  I'm not a big pasta fan and I think most places in the North End let their reputation precede them, and they don't really do much in the realm of innovative or great cuisine (with the exception of maybe 2 or 3 places out of 100).  The buttered brioche lobster roll at Neptune's is unbelievable!! Far and away the best lobster roll I've ever had.  The brioche is grilled in butter and the lobster is lightly coated in a buttery sauce. It's really something everyone should eat at least once.Oysters here are great too; but I do think good oysters can be found at many restaurants in Boston.",4,6/11/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
730,"1.6 seconds.What, you ask?  What is 1.6 seconds?Well, silly, that's the amount of time it took for me to be completely, hopelessly, happily in love with Neptune Oyster.   All it took was one oyster.  The next 20 were just as delicious.   And everything else thereafter.",4,6/11/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
731,"Two words:  Fried clams.  Fried Ipswich clams, to be specific, and oh man were they delicious.  A mix of whole belly clams and clam strips, though the majority were juicy whole bellies, coated with a perfectly crispy and flavorful batter.  The clams were served with a house-made tartar sauce that's so tangy and addictive, I wanted to lick the bowl clean.  Pretty much perfection.For an entree I opted for the cold Maine lobster roll with mayo (it's available hot and with butter, too).  It comes with either french fries, or a salad and I chose the salad since I had already had quite a few fried clams.  Fortunately, since it costs $25, the lobster roll did not disappoint.  The huge chunks of lightly dressed lobster meat were tucked into a perfectly toasted roll that tasted like brioche to me - faintly sweet, and a great complement to the lobster.  The side salad was a simple and equally delicious combination of butter lettuce, chopped hazelnuts and a light vinaigrette.My only complaint is that the space is so small and it was so crowded that the servers bumped into our table each and every time they passed by.",4,6/15/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
732,"I went to college in Boston, and currently live in MN.  I would buy a ticket to fly back for an evening with the sole purpose to eat at Neptune Oysters.  It is that good.  I had been reading reviews and heard from my fellow foodie connoisseurs about how great the place was for years and a couple weeks ago, I finally got to eat there.It was HEAVENLY.  I went with my boyfriend and two close college friends.  My significant other and I split the lobster roll, which we got hot.  Imagine the softest, sweetest, most enjoyable roll cut down the middle and filled with the freshest, most succulent and perfectly cooked chunks of lobster drizzled with creamy melted butter.   It was heaven.  Our table also split the raw seafood platter for 3.  They were the best oysters, little neck clams, mussels and fresh crab salad and fresh lobster salad I have enjoyed in my life.  This is the same platter that I am enjoying in my picture.  The shrimp cocktail that came with the platter was perfectly cooked and chilled so it crunched when you bit into it.  I'm still telling my friends in MN about it.All of this was about $25-30 per person. I walked away stuffed, and oh so satisfied.  Do your taste buds a favor.  Go to Neptune Oysters.",5,6/16/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

I ended up with the Alaskan Black Cod and some other thing I cant even pronounce...regardless this place is awesome!

736,"Neptune Oyster, I love you. Seriously, I can't say enough good things about this place. The oysters are the best I've ever had - perfectly shucked, fresh, delicious, awesome. My friend and I attempt to eat our body weight in oysters each time we visit. The vitello tonato and lobster roll are terrific alternatives as well. Combine that with an adventurous, off-the-beaten-path wine list, and the adorable young woman behind the bar and this place is one of my two favorite restaurants in Boston!

Comes with lots'o'fries if lobster and butter aren't filling enough. Pricey at $25, but they don't skimp on the lobster. Also had the special of the day, a striper with blue crab salad and creamy mashed potatoes ($30). Everything was delish. The singular disappointment was the clam chowder, which was undersalted and watery. But overall, very pleased with the entrées.

739,"A great seafood place in the heart of North End. If you're an oyster fan, they have a wide selection, and oh the freshness. You will not see just regular 'oyster' on the menu - there's actually a separate menu for oysters that goes into much detail on the various types and their flavors - salty, sweet, plump, juicy, nutty, fruity. Wellfleet, Island Creek, I.C. Neptune, Cape Breton, Pemaquid, Summersides. I never imagined so many different flavors of oysters and clams. We washed down the oysters with a pint of Guinness and finished up with a lobster roll. In Boston, lobster rolls are almost as prevalent as clam chowder, but these are a cut above the rest and definitely are worth the $25. Most other places, you get a stale bun, mayo-smothered claw meat, and buyer's remorse. At Neptune, you will be proudly presented with a lightly toasted slightly buttered bun, huge chunks of premium lobster meat, perfectly seasoned, and a side of french fries.",5,6/28/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

742,"Two words: lobster roll. Three more words: hot with butter. Utter these when the waiter comes by and asks for your order, and you will never be the same. I frankly don't like traditional Boston lobster rolls that much - cold lobster with all that mayonnaise and other junk? Why would you ruin one of the most delicious creatures the ocean has to offer? Neptune does it right. Serve the lobster hot, slather it with butter, and on top of a rich toasty roll. I've ordered other stuff here too, but only when they've been out of lobster rolls (not a common occurence - I go here a lot!)Additionally, if you're an oyster lover, then this is your place. About a dozen different oysters to choose from, they arrive fresh daily and are shucked right in the storefront, for all passers-by to see. They bring by a menu that's descriptive with a full flavor profile of each oyster and let you pick and choose. I usually get 4-6 different ones to try before my meal.",5,7/3/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

I mean, if you feel OK joking about raw bar and mesmerizing wine lists then go ahead, take a stab at it but I bet your one liner will be about as funny as that time when I *blanked* your mom.Here is a recipe for a perfect Sunday afternoon in Boston:-wake up with a mild hangover-head straight to Chinatown and eat things that will burn the demons out of you-go for a long, scorching walk and navigate herds of gregarious tourists-enter the North End and find Salem St-go to Neptune Oyster ahead of dinner crowd and sit at the bar-get an oyster card and order with abandon -order crisp clean beers and white wines as well-rinse, repeat-make nice with Vinny the bar guy and make plans to return to Neptune Oyster sooner rather than later-get sidetracked on your way home and drink more beer",5,7/13/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
747,"Over a year later, this is still hands down my favorite restaurant in Boston.  All I can say is: Lobster roll, lobster roll, lobster roll.  Fuck location.  Its all about the lobster roll.  They make the lobster rolls two different ways.  Sure there's the traditional way with the mayo, kinda cold, a refreshing summer treat that most new englanders are familiar with and then there's the hot lobster roll.Oh my god, I can honestly say that this lobster roll was hands down the greatest thing i've ever eaten in my life.  The lobster tastes as if its been poached in butter and vanilla bean and chopped up and dumped into a toasted bun.   We're talking sheer ecstasy people.  The kind you feel when your whole body warms up and you feel a tingling going up and down your spine.  It took all the restraint in my body to stop me from ordering 2 more right there on the spot.Now listen very closely, if you like lobster and can afford a 20 $ sandwich that can envoke the same feeling as one of those ""special massages"" in chinatown, then go to Neptune and enjoy.  Just try not to drool on the bar.",5,7/13/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
748,"If you have a ton of time to relax and eat raw oysters forever and ever and not worry about food poisoning or how much your check will be, this is the place.The variety of oysters and the special way that they prepare the seafood in the kitchen menu is pretty exciting to sample.

750,"Oh man.  What can i say about this place with sounding like a blabbering idiot?Well I am from the San Fransisco bay area, and as such my girlfriend and I have been on a crusade to learn as much about good seafood and where to find it as we can.  So when I found out she needed to go to Boston I hopped along intent to find one meal that would make me come back for more.After perusing Yelp I decided Neptune Oyster sounded like the place for me.  I love seafood, especially shellfish, and a lobster always sounds like a good idea for me.  I also really wanted to try the oysters, I've never had any raw and I have a habit of spoiling myself rather early on when it comes to habits and hobbies.My girlfriend and I started with the fried ipswitch clams.  I've had a decent amount of fried clams, and these babies were eye opening.  The taste was extraordinary, it didn't seem like they were fried at times, the batter was so light, but just crispy enough, and the clams tasted phenomenal.Then we moved on to some raw oysters and clams.  I don't know too much about this area, but I am now hooked and scouring the bay area for oyster bars...thank you neptune.My girlfriend got the tuna carpachio for lunch, and was delighted with her plate.  She is not a very big salad fan but loves tuna.  She was surprised by the ""fresh selection"" of vegetables and absolutely loved the tuna (she told me to make sure I mention how good her salad was when I write this).I had the infamous lobster roll and well, it lived up to its name.  I can't say to much about it that hasn't been said, but not only was it hard to leave the restaurant, I didn't want to get up, absolutely delicious, especially considering some of the slim pickings on the west coast.All in all, an appetizer, a smattering of clams and oysters, with two lunches, 85$ including tip, mission accomplished.  I am coming back next summer.",5,7/15/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

The service was great.  Since we sat at the bar, we had a very attentive bartender.  They had a great wine selection but I opted for a nice cold beer.  Prices are a bit steep, but the food is truly worth it.  I can't wait to come back again!",5,7/21/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

Regardless, a nice glass of Vihno Verde cooled me right off, along with a half dozen oysters. I had the hot lobster roll here this past winter, and it's by far my fav in the city. I ventured out and tried the scallops, which were rich and caramelized on top. Beets, hazelnuts, goat cheese, watercress, and figs really set the scallops off. Plus the diver scallops were huge!

They don't take reservations so we got there around 6:30 and put our name in for a table. The hostess said it would probably be 2 hours, so we left our phone number so we didn't have to wait in line for 2 hours which was nice. However when they did call, they apologized for calling 20 minutes too early, and even when we did get there---they had ""sold out"" of tables and were no longer accepting names for tables. People had to take the chance to sit at the bar. We were waiting on a table that had had their check and was just sitting there for approx 45 minutes.  I don't know how they sat there for that long. It was extremely warm in the restaurant due to the lack of air flow probably due to the number of people crammed in there.  Plus it's so crowded that you would think that once they are finished with their meal, they would be mindful of the other people, sign their check, and leave.  But that's not Neptune's fault that they are so desired.  Was it worth the wait? Hell F*ing Absolutely!!!!",4,8/2/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
755,"As a preface, I am not a big seafood eater.  In fact, it's something I've only really started to incorporate into my diet over the last few years.  I've tried to be a little more daring, especially when I travel, and I've gotten to the point where I can appreciate good seafood when it's done right, but the majority of the time I still opt for land dwelling proteins.I was entertaining a few friends for the weekend and one of them wanted some New England clam chowder for dinner.  I saw all of Neptune's stellar reviews on Yelp and after a quick walk from the waterfront, we put our name in for a table.  It was around 5:15pm so the place wasn't too crowded but as soon as we were greeted by the hostess about 5 more parties showed up.  We had made it just in the nick!  Sitting on a random stoop resting our sore feet, watching our ""5-10 minute"" wait slowly creep into a half an hour, I started to get grouchy.  The hostess seemed annoyed by us as we checked on our underestimated wait time.  I eyed the menu warily due to the high prices and interesting (read: frightening) varieties of fish and seafood and was all set to hate the place.When we eventually did get to sit in the bar-lined tiny rectangular room all of my frustration melted away.  Upon closer inspection, I found the menu creative and intelligent and actually couldn't decide what to order between all of the tasty items.  I wasn't so daring as to take advantage of the raw bar but the table next to us, which we were cozily close to, tried several kinds of oysters and seemed very pleased.We began with blood orange bellinis which mostly tasted like champagne to me but their crispness was a perfect compliment to the upcoming seafood.  The lobster caprese was sumptuous perfection with enormous chunks of beautifully cooked lobster and fresh buffalo mozzarella, halved red and yellow cherry tomatoes, delicate greens, and a splash of pesto and olive oil.  I tasted this salad slowly, trying to savor every element, looked up from my plate and proclaimed, ""I have never felt this way about lobster before!""  And it's true.  Far from the heavy disguised lobster bisque of my past, this salad was fresh and light and complex and my mouth waters just thinking about it.Neptune's has also perfected the art of the sear.  On Saturdays the special is tuna and this one was cooked just right and served over greens, salty bacon, and creamy avocado, with a side of soft-shell crab.  I ordered the scallops which were nestled amongst mission figs, beets, tomatoes, and a gorgonzola fonduta which added a richness to the creamy melty scallops.  I would risk disease for this undercooked shellfish anyday.  I asked my friend how his mussel dish was and he shook his head and said ""It was terrible,"" smiling down on an enormous bowl of empty shells.The service was the kind of subtle perfection I dream of providing in my own restaurant some day (if I were ever to open one)- magically refilled water glasses, empty plates disappearing from your table before you even know they're gone, salesmanship, personality, and best of all, an extensive knowledge of the food.  This smoothness was especially impressive in such a small and busy space.  The waitresses could have easily been bumping the back of my chair all night or trying to push us out the door.I think the main reason I was able to enjoy the seafood even as the most moderate fish consumer was the ease of the presentation.  I didn't see anyone eating a whole lobster and hacking away violently at the shells.  There were no fish eyes or scales or anything to suggest the previous slimy life of the food on my plate.  Everything was fresh and flavorful and elegantly presented and I couldn't have asked for more.  As you can tell by the novel I just wrote, Neptune's is wonderful.  They provide the kind of meal that transports you, relaxes you, and feeds your soul.  The prices were higher than my usual but not too high for a meal like this.  It was my first true 5-star meal experience of the summer.",5,8/2/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
756,"So based on the latest Best of Boston mag, I hightailed my rear before my flight to Neptune's.  I ran around with my luggage going first to Mike's and then circling back to Neptune, by which point I was a hot tranny mess.  Yes, I looked like a deranged loon sweating profusely, sexy I know, but one would think I walked in with a Yankees cap.I asked for the buttered lobster roll to go only to have it made into a major production since apparently it is against their policy.  But after a short wait and a glass of much need water, off I went to catch my flight.  Even after three hours the lobster roll held up well.  What's there to mess up? Butter, lobster, and a white roll.  Simple, quality ingredients put together well.  You get a great deal of lobster tail meat that it's almost too much.  The only down side is I just found out that I'm not that fond of lobster.  But what a way to find out: by sheer excess!  All for $26 and you don't have to fight for your food, all the de-shelled meat awaits you in a hot, buttered hoagie roll.",4,8/6/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

758,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Boston.  I've been here probably at least 40 times in the last year and a half.  If you like raw bar, you'd love this place.  On any given day, they have at least a dozen different types of oysters.   They also carry cherrystones, littlenecks, bay scallops, shrimp cocktail, crab claws and lobster.  I think the cherrystones deserve a special mention because they are the freshest, sweetest and plumpest cherrystones I've ever had!  The crudo specials are also really good so they are different worth a try.  My fiancee doesn't touch the raw bar but he loves the cooked dishes.  He always tries the specials and has yet to be disappointed.  I know that a lot of people like their lobster rolls (served either hot with butter or cold with mayo) and they're good but I think Alive & Kicking has better ones (served in toasted scali bread instead of rolls).  One tip: make sure you come here at odd times because they tend to get really busy during lunch and dinner hours (esp. after winning Best of Boston).",5,8/8/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

For something on a hot dog bun?!), but all was forgiven when I took my first bite. There could well have been an entire hot, buttery, perfect lobster unloaded into the oversized bun.  The decor matched the food, in that it was comfortably casual, but elegant at the same time. It is a small place dominated by a big marble topped bar. (I love eating at the bar and people watching.) The staff is attentive without being pushy. It was just well-executed the whole way around.The only negatives are that its size makes it a no go for groups and ensures long waits if you don't go at an off peak time. And the price point puts it out of the realm of the every day.",4,8/10/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
761,"We went here today for lunch at around 4pm.  We didn't have to wait but the place was pretty full already with only 4 seats left.  We took 2 and a couple behind us took the remaining seats.  Being our first time here, we ordered the lobster roll (mayo and butter) and shared them so we can compare.  My bf and I liked both of them.  The lobster was fresh and it came in generous portions (big huge pieces).  I preferred the butter one slightly more because it was warm but my bf thought there was too much butter.  We also ordered mussels, and the waiter asked if we wanted bread with it.  I am so glad he asked because the sauce was so good for bread dipping. ...heck, I would've drank it alone :-P  Overall, good place to check out.  Can't wait to try other dishes next time.

The line can build up outside as this place is good  food wise and tiny seating wise. It literally seems to only fit 10-12 people and I may be exaggerating by 2 people how many it can hold. The wine and beer selection was good and the food was even better. Stop in when you get a chance. It's a great place to get food before a celts/bruin game or Garden event.",4,8/18/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
763,"Pleasant stop on a hot evening, I can't believe we got a table as every other time I've tried going its been a long wait.  Not a thing to complain about, but don't go here if you or anyone you're with is a vegetarian...or if you're not willing to get cozy with fellow diners.  A lovely restaurant that felt authentically Boston, and a great spot for people watching and drinking.",4,8/21/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
764,"Went tonight to Neptune after seeing the article in Boston Magazine in our hotel room. Quoted 15 minutes at the door, ended up waiting 45 and would've gladly waited another half-hour as it was stellar.The oysters and clams on the half-shell were the freshest imaginable...honestly, we've all had oysters at all kinds of places and you think, okay, oysters, whether from Mass. or the Pacific Northwest or the Canadian maritimes are oysters...but somehow the oysters at Neptune tasted fresher and cleaner than any I've ever had.As much as I liked the seafood, I was also really impressed by the wine list...whomever is in charge of the wine program there knows what they're doing. Great wines from around the world that are the perfect compliments to the great food. I savored three glasses of a Domaine du Bagnol Rose while my partner downed three of an inexpensive, but excellent Vermentino....Can't wait to go back Sunday night. A dozen cherrystones and a lobster roll are next up on my list before heading back to San Francisco, but not sure I can part with the French rose by-the-glass...",5,8/21/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
765,"This was a place recommended by a good friend - who just jumped to ""GREAT"" friend status.It was awesome.  Hubbie and I were celebrating our 10th anniversary weekend-style - and wanted lobster and clams - we got both!The place is wikked tiny but we were seated at the bar, which was comfortable and if you don't mind being (lovingly) pushed and shoved as people try to get by - the bar is fine and fun.  The waitresses at the bar make it easy to take it easy when it gets crowded.First of all the cherrystones were succulent and beautifully displayed.  Ordered 12 and 2 oysters.  (I Love the fact that you can order 1 of everything if you so wish.)  After the 12 - had to have 6 more.Our main course - whole sea bass with fingerlings and a creamy sauce and pan-broiled lobster with chiorizio and corn.Can I just say YUMMIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My fish was light and delightful.  Sweet and moist and very flavorful.The lobster was buttery and beautifully done.I'm hungry AGAIN just thinking about it. a total YES for anyone who loves a fantastic raw bar and awesome entree's",5,8/23/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
766,"Adding to the Neptune love, nothing to add to the already informative reviews.",5,8/24/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
767,"This place reminds me a lot of some of the great restaurants in NYC... can't beat the tight atmosphere and great food.  We started off by sampling six different types of oysters from Mass, Maine and B.C. and the clam chowder.  All were very fresh and the meal could have been made at that point.  But then it was the Monday night special, which came highly recommended by the staff - Lobster Spaghetti. Wow!  it was hard to identify the spices but suffice to say it was a perfected blend of flavor, sauce and no lack of rich lobster meet, of which I am typically less than favorable towards.  Coupled with a very dry Italian white wine, the dish made the night.  Not far behind, however, was the scallops entree that one of our party had, which was truly a melt-in-your-mouth sensation.  Unfortunately no room for desert, but the generous and patient wait staff didn't mind us staying around to chat and finish some drinks.",5,8/24/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
768,"I love raw oysters and this place has quite the variety. We dined here for lunch while on a long weekend to Boston. We sat at the bar which was lots of fun. This place is teeny-tiny so expect to wait depending on time of day. We actually stopped in for lunch around 1pm and were seated at the bar right away- we were ready to wait which made it even better. I started off with a variety of raw oysters. I am from down south where a raw oyster is a raw oyster (we don't have types to choose from) so our server  explained to me in great detail how all were different. I settled on a variety of local MA oysters and they were so tasty. My husband and I each ordered the  hot lobster roll. Oh my god- it was like heaven dipped in butter and served on a bread made of deliciousness. I wish more restaurants offered there lobster rolls this way. If you get the roll you have to do it hot, its just so different than the others we had rest of the weekend. This place was terrific - just wish it wasn't so far from Chicago.",5,8/27/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
769,"Maybe the conditions were just optimal....I had to go with the 4.   We found parking out front which is like some sort of miracle in the North End.   Walked into the normally packed restaurant and got seated right away at a gorgeous table.   Had a fantastic bottle of white with the a dozen of the freshest oysters- followed by one of the most interesting appetizers.  Crostini with uni, strawberries and bacon.   It exploded with flavor and was like nothing I have ever tasted.   I want to go back now and have it again.   Knowledgeable, friendly staff- All and all a fantastic experience.",4,8/28/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
770,"Our dinner here last night was excellent.  I had the swordfish and it was cooked perfectly.  My girlfriend had the Tuesday special, fish and chips and it looked and tasted great.The scallops looked great too.",4,9/2/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
771,Neptune Oyster is a low key neighborhood type of place. It isn't a chain and the quality is consistent. It is a great place eat with friends for a casual meal. Large counter with about fifteen stools and loose tables make up about fifty seats. The oyster selection is quite large and very fresh. All of the fish and seafood is very good and all fresh. As you have read here on yelp the Warm Buttered Lobster is a real stand out. If you like Lobster Rolls; you will not be disappointed. Every person I have taken here has LOVED the Warm Lobster Roll. They also have a very decent wine list and small list of beers. Great for casual dining with a group or just yourself. Parking is terrible as it is in the North End. Salem Street is a small one-way street so you will not likely find a parking spot. Better to park on Hanover or any other main street and walk to Salem Street. I have eaten at Neptune's over thirty times and the Five Star rating is for the consistent fresh seafood and one and only Warm Lobster Roll.,5,9/3/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
772,"You can't be in Boston without trying the purported best lobster roll, right? And so, the foodie travels continued!The three of us ordered a trio of oyster twins, one of which I've forgotten the name of (it wasn't that delicious, but was okay), the nice Martha's vineyard ones, and the west coast Kumamoto? Something that sounded Japanese, at least. All were nice and fresh, although I personally did not enjoy the west coast ones. We also tried the clam chowder and hamachi, both of which were quite good. The chowder really has real clams in it, and you can even see them, which is refreshing. I loved the sauce the hamachi was in...the flavors melded quite nicely.And, yes, the lobster rolls. We had one cold and one hot. In each the chunks of lobster were so huge and so succulent that I nearly couldn't believe it. Really, really, delicious. Between the hot and the cold, I lean slightly to the hot, as the hot butter all over lobster and soaking into the roll is really delicious, not to say that cold mayo isn't good. It just kind of depends on the mood. The thing is though, they're $25/roll...so...if I were on my own, suddenly craving lobster roll, I'd probably go to Alive and Kicking for something more affordable. The fries with the lobster rolls were almost good too, but really too salty. Really, really salty. I had to brush off the salt before they were edible.Neptune Oyster has great food, to be sure, but nothing mindblowing. But if you seek fresh seafood, a nice live bar, or excellent lobster rolls then look no further. Just make sure your wallet can handle it first.",4,9/4/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
773,"Awesome food.  Bad service.  Long line ups.  Expensive but worth it.  Stupid mirror used as a ""today's special"" announcement board.",5,9/5/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
774,"I love oysters.  I order them every chance I get.  (which is a lot in NY, NJ, Philly, and AZ)  The kumamoto oysters (my favorite and I ordered 6....my table ordered more than 20) were a shame.  First of all, they were the size of a dime.  Never have I seen them that small.  Secondly, the mignonette sauce is just embarrassingly bland.  After a long wait, I expected to get some great oysters!  Other than that, the food was fine.  Everything was pretty yummy, but not outstanding.  Sea scallops were good, but I've had better.  The tuna tare tare sandwich was loved by some.  Lobster special was good.  Yellow tail had good flavor.  The standout for me was the bronzini fish.  That was delicious and the only thing worth having here.  I'm being completely honest when I say that I wish the oysters here lived up to its name.",2,9/9/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
775,"Had to find out what all the hype was about. At 4pm on a Saturday we had to wait 30 minutes for a place at the bar. The wait was worth it. Fresh oysters and yellowfin tuna and swordfish were had along with martini's and a great Tasmanian pinot noir. Service at the bar was attentive and exceptional. The seafood beats any other fish house in Boston hands down for freshness. Although the place is small and crowded, there was a great foodie vibe about the place - everyone here was grooving on the food. There are no reservations to be had here and if you come at a busy time, you will likely have to deal with the ad hoc system of getting a table since there is no host person handling the door. Be patient, it's worth the wait.",5,9/10/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
776,"I didn't want to yelp about this place  but once Ben Affleck's movie, The Town, comes out, the tourist hordes are going to come anyways so I might as well just shout it from the rooftop.Amazing food. Any place that can render me speechless with one bite is something special. In addition to their raw bar, you've got to try out their caesar salad, made with real anchovies, and the amazing, juicy, delectable neptune burger. It's a tasty hunk of beef with fried oysters on top. Yes fried oysters. But even without, it's still good. And the pomme frites are so good. And the rest of their entrees are incredible. I could go on but you get the drift.Prepare for a wait because it is a small location but it's so worth the wait. So worth it.",5,9/12/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
777,"The absolute best Lobster Roll on the planet. When in Boston, I wanted to try an authentic lobster roll, and thanks fellow Yelper's you were right, Neptunes has it!  It is a bit on the pricey side, $25 (plus a glass of wine at $11), but you get like an entire lobster in a huge bun.  I ended up only eating half the bun.  This is a super small place, but if one or two are going, you should be able to get a spot at the bar.  Next time, I'm going to spend more time here on an empty stomach and try out the chowder, and fresh oysters.",5,9/13/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
778,"Yum!!!  Try the Bronzini!   That's what I had this time- I took my mom and grandmother.The lobster bisque was fantastic.  The clam chowder was amazing, and not like a thick glob of glue like many places...  Awesome!Nice wine list.  I just wish the waitress had asked before she assumed we wanted another round of the same thing- I would have ordered something else to try.",4,9/14/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
779,"I don't hand out 5 stars very often (think O Ya), but this place was phenomenal.  My friend and I had the Triton Plateau (which had oysters, raw clams, mussels, shrimp, crab salad, and lobster salad), some additional oysters, and a plate of fried clams.  Everything we ate tasted fresh off the boat, the presentation was beautiful, and the fried clams came with the most wonderful tartar sauce.  I would not have expected tartar sauce to be a highlight of any dinner, but this was freshly made, not too heavy or thick, and tasted great. Admittedly, there was quite a wait even on a Wednesday night, but it was so worth it.  If you're at all a fan of raw seafood, this is the place for you.  I'm looking forward to going back to try some of their cooked dishes, although I'm not sure I can resist the temptation of all that beautiful shellfish.",5,9/17/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
780,"OK. If you like shellfish. This is THE place for you. Like a lot of North End eateries, Neptune is small, a bit cramped and has no waiting area or lounge to speak of. We were there on a Saturday nite and made the prudent choice to arrive just before 6pm. Our wait time was 30 minutes, and the hostess contacted us by cell phone once a table was ready. I'm not a big oyster guy but the selection of oyster types seemed plentiful. Lots of other raw bar choices as well:  from clams to jumbo shrimp to crab to sea urchin. (Sea urchin?!  No thanks.)  I fully expected to be wowed by the seafood, and I was not disappointed. My applewood bacon scallops were delicious, and my gal's lobster roll was as sumptuous as the prior reviews indicate.  A really nice suprise was the assortment of local craft beers on hand. The Allagash White paired excellently with my meal.",4,9/22/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

782,"Waited over an hour for a table for four on a Tuesday night at 8:00. We waited since the ratings were all good. I had the clam chowder. The best I have had. The clams tasted like they were just shucked. The broth was just perfect, not to thick or overly creamy. I also sampled a clam and oyster from the over dozen to choose from. I ordered the snapper with artichoke with truffles. Excellent, but I would prefer the skin removed. The table spent over $200 before tip, which include only 3 beers. A little pr icy but worth it.",5,9/25/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
783,"This is one of the smallest restaurants I've ever been to. Literally a hole in the wall with most of the patrons sitting at the counter. We were told the wait was going to be an hour, but it turned out to be almost two - didn't eat until almost 11pm!Nevertheless, it was worth the wait. I've been craving East Coast raw oysters for a while and Neptune did not disappoint. The Mt. Vineyard oysters stood out the most, with it's ""popcorn finish"". We also had a bowl of clam chowda. I must say, I was surprised at how non-creamy it was, and the celery was a very nice surprise. Lastly, we had the $25 lobster roll. My god why have I never had a lobster roll before?? Always with hot butter, none of that cold mayo crap.My suggestion: Go early, put your name down, and enjoy a drink at Bacco's before dinner. And always eat your seafood with a nice glass of wine or bubbly.",5,9/27/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
784,"Went here on a recommendation from a Boston local. The dinning area is very cozy with a couple of tables and a bar area. Only beer and wine is served here. Impressive! I ordered a variety of oysters on a half shell with both the white wine vinegar and cocktail sauce. Oysters were very fresh! Not complaints here. It was on par with some of the oysters I've had in Seattle!  After a few locally brewed beers, I finally decided to get the one of the house specials, a dish with a crouton, topped with braised pork, topped with a deep fried oyster. It was served with a pistachio vinaigrette, and golden raisins. At first I was skeptical about the whole pistachio/raisin/oyster combination was going to play out. But in reality it worked! It worked well!Overall it was a pretty good experience, my only regret was that I was too full to try the lobster rolls. Next time!",5,9/30/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
785,"My former roomie who goes to Harvard loves this place and took me and our other friends while we were visiting her.Oysters are FRESH and SO tasty!! YUM, YUM, YUM! between $2.5-3 per oyster - if it wasn't so pricey, I would've eaten tons. Maybe it's a good thing so that I not as much in danger of health risks for eating raw, uncooked food (I do read pay attention to warning labels)... But, life's too short anyways, right?Lobster sandwich - $25 BUT YUUUMMMMMM - Oo, nice buttery (not too overly though), chunky lobster inside a tasty roll. My former roomie raved about it and I do have to say, I was a bit skeptical even though I trust her taste. I didn't want to be disappointed, you know? it certainly met my expectations! Goodness in my mouthness. :) It comes with delicious fries that we couldn't stop eating even though we were full. Didn't finish but ate a lot of it.My friend's appetitzer - octopus w/ polenta ($13) was tasty as well. My other friend's louis (crab) salad ($17) was also tasty - they know how to do seafood right - fresh and seasoned well enough to make it tasty but not overpower the freshness.You might think it's a bit on the pricer end but worth the quality! The portions aren't actually tiny either. I looked at other diner's plates and quantity seemed good. The salad may seem a bit pricey for those who values quanitity though. Nevertheless, I think whatever you get, yYou won't be disappointed with your meal! You taste buds will thank you and you will leave the restaurant smiling. :)Service was wonderful - waiter was attentive, filled out water as needed, had good recommendations,",5,10/5/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster
786,"If you are looking for the perfect lobster roll, this is the place to go!  I thought that this place served better lobster roll than Maine, though it is much more expensive at $25.  Of course, we had to try the oysters too, which were amazing.  What people don't know about it the branzini Cinque Terre style--we came to this place specifically to try it because we have been to Cinque Terre and missed branzini.  It's not quite as good as it is in Cinque Terre, but it is still pretty darn good!  They serve it whole (like they do in Italy), plentiful, and flavored with a similar pesto sauce.  The flesh of the fish was creamy, moist, and perfectly cooked.  Simply delicious. It's a small place, crowded, slow service, not child-friendly, but totally worth it for the food!  We came for a late lunch around 1:30 (party of 4 + baby) so we were able to get in.  Definitely a must-try place in Boston if you're looking for seafood!",5,10/6/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

The place was about two/thirds full. After waiting five minutes or so, I walked over to ask if there was a table. I got cold stares and then was told they would be with me in a minute. They resumed their girlfriend chat. I left.

788,"My first lobster roll and hopefully not my last. Just perfectly cooked lobster. I've never liked any lobster but the Chinese sauteed variety. Everything else is just too expensive. This was worth it. I am never writing off American seafood again!!!!!I loved their raw bar. The prices are great and our oysters were clean. I didn't particularly like either sauce with the oyster because I eat the oyster for it's pure, how do I put it, sexiness. Their oysters are just sexy and perfect. I see how it's been seen as an aphrodisiac and Neptune does it right.I got the warm lobster roll. Thank you yelpers!!!!! It's a great investment. The staff was very friendly despite my party having huge backpacks-we were basically backpacking through Boston house-searching. The restaurant is small but everyone seems to be having a great time. I love this place and I hope everyone else gives it a try.",5,10/7/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

The raw oysters were OK.  The menu has selections of oysters from just about every town on the cape, maine and new brunswick, a bit much. I inquired about cape, (bay)  scallops because they should be in season.  They said yes, they have some ""welfleet"" cape scallops, so I ordered some. They didn't look or taste like to cape's to me. But in any case they were smothered in herbs, something you just don't  do to real capes.  All in all an above average experience.",3,10/21/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

There were four people in our party, we showed up around 7:30 to put our name in and they said the wait was about an hour, so we left a cell phone number and went to another place to have a drink. Almost exactly an hour later they called and our table was ready. The oyster selection is great, and I think their descriptions of the various oysters were helpful and accurate. The rest of the food was good, not great. I had the hot buttered lobster roll. The meat was perfectly cooked, and nice big chunks. At $25 I thought it was on the high end of reasonable. My complaint was that they actually used too much butter, and the roll was so buttery it was almost inedible. The wife got a Caesar salad for $17, which I thought was way overpriced. All in all, I liked Neptune Oyster but I think B&G in the South End is hands down the better oyster spot.",3,11/2/2009,Restaurant Neptune Oyster

We put our name on the list and they told us they would call our phone when the table was ready since there was no waiting room. So we went to a bar nearby and never got a call....The food was tasty but not as good as we expected - one of the appetizers tasted a little fishy...I thought good fish wasn't supposed to taste fishy? They had just run out of the veal and tuna sandwich (Thursday night at 7:30) which we were really looking forward to, so that was disappointing.

Neptune Oyster won with both.The oyster selection is fresh and delicious - the menu was great in describing the flavor, saltiness and finish of the oysters. We also had the fried ipswich clams - delicious and came with a unique tartar sauce. Cioppino wasn't a traditional cioppino - too watery, spicy - but the seafood in the cioppino was fresh, plump and delicious! I came back two days later for lunch by myself for some more oysters and also to try the chowda. Best chowda I had in Boston. Creamy, fresh clams, perfect potato and celery bites..

When a couple was seated next to us the waiter was there within 5 minutes to tell them the specials and take their drink order. Oh, okay, it's just us getting bad service - awesome. For food I tried both the hot and cold lobster rolls. So, being from Texas, I had never had a lobster roll before. After looking on Yelp, this seemed to be the place to try one. I have to say I was a little disappointed. I am not sure if I am just not a fan of the lobster roll, so I can't fault the restaurant for this.
