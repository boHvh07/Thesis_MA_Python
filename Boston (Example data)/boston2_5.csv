0,"I would give this place 4 stars, only I ate some chilean sea bass and it made me puke. After speaking with the manager, I found out that chilean sea bass is the most popular thing on the menu, which makes sense because it is the most fantastic fish I have ever tasted.  But, I don't think I'll be eating it again for various reasons.  All in all, the food is really good here and I'd recommend it as a great semi-fancy plate to eat out.  But, don't go running around after eating the chilean sea bass (which actually isn't sea bass, it's eel.)",3,4/21/2005,Atlantic Fish
1,"GREAT SEAFOOD.  I like this way better than the overrated Legal SeaFoods which serves very blah inconsistent seafood.   Here the seafod is fresher,  tastier and more consistent.  Just better menu and great food!  Great Lobster ravioli.  Very nice pear salad!! Good deserts as well--- LOVE the chocolate cake w/ fresh raspberry sauce!! YUM!  Nice decor.",5,7/10/2005,Atlantic Fish
2,Really good seafood. Great location for a date night at the Loews Boston Common either preceded or followed by dinner out.  Big meals. Semi-expensive but nice for a fun night out.,4,7/20/2005,Atlantic Fish
3,"In terms of its menu offerings , Atlantic Fish Co is very similar to Legal Seafoods. The same can be said for the quality of the seafood and the actual dishes (like my favorite, fried clams). However I believe Atlantic is a touch of class above Legal simply because of the atmosphere and the clientel it seems to attract. This is not the highest-end of the restaurants out there in Boston, but it is still somewhat expensive. It's a great place to treat yourself to if you have a seafood craving and you want a guaranteed good seafood meal.",4,7/20/2005,Atlantic Fish
4,Great open feel to this place.   Clam chowder is amazing.   Our server was about 12 years old and a bit clueless but the amazing food made up for this.    Salads age yummy and seafood is consistent.   Great location too.,4,7/30/2005,Atlantic Fish
5,"This is the best place to eat seafood in downtown Boston (though it still can not come place to some South Shore and Cape spots).  The chowder is great, the scallops and shrimp are amazing, and every type of fish I've tried here was fantastic.  The service is exceptional as well and in the summer the restaurant is open so it has a very nice atmosphere.",5,8/26/2005,Atlantic Fish
6,"As someone that doesn't eat a lot of fish, I cannot wait to go back to Atlantic Fish Co. I just went last week for a friend's graduation. The food was amazing, and the service was great. Our waitress was very helpful and accommodating. A great thing about this place is that they have a good amount of non-fish options if you do not like fish at all. Be sure to check out a dessert if you have room. It is wonderful!",5,9/6/2005,Atlantic Fish
7,"freshman year, i went here with a friend and had the cheapest item on the menu:  $13 for an huge salad topped with enormous grilled scallops, jumbo shrimp, hunks of calamari, etc.  i'm still haunted by the memory of the salad the seafood was sooooooo good.  i went back again junior year, but the salad was no longer on the menu, and i ended up having something far more expensive but far less memorable (i don't remember what ;-) ).  their clam chowder, in my opinion, ranks among the best in the city.",4,9/19/2005,Atlantic Fish
8,"I don't mind going to the Atlantic Fish Company, it wouldn't be one of my first choices but if others suggest it I don't have a problem with it. The food is decent and reasonably priced.",4,1/31/2006,Atlantic Fish
9,"Holy moly those were some scrumptious pan-seared giant scallops! Nor is the seabass to be spat at (though it is a bit pricey). So overall, good marks for food, but not a lot to distinguish it from Legal Seafood.Atmosphere and service are somewhat more haphazard. The main dining room is quite large and very crowded and noisy. Also, although we had a reservation we were made to wait to be seated at a table. A few minutes later, a new waitress shows up and asks us to move to another table. Not how I expect to be treated at what styles itself as one of Boston's classier restaurants. And although the service is friendly, it hardly qualifies as snappy.Oh, and swordfish is endangered - just so you know.",4,3/15/2006,Atlantic Fish
10,"I just went to this restaurant the other day and everything i had was great.. the goat cheese salad is delicious and the lobster bisque as well.. they had some pastas that looked very good as well.. i think is a really nice place to go for lunch.. but with your parents, because it is a little bit expensive.. haha.. but its still very very good.. cant wait to go back..",4,5/25/2006,Atlantic Fish
11,"The calamari with peperocini is the best ever. The kitchen serves food until 11 pm, making this the perfect place to grab an appetizer and drink. Surprisingly, this place has amazing sangria made from scratch infront of your eyes. Review update: I went here for dinner the other week and had to raise to 5 stars. Definitely try the cucumber lobster gazpacho mmm. My sea bass was perfectly pan seared and paired with lobster ravioli on a bed of arugula and spinach yum! My boyfriend could not conquer the ciopino..and if he cant finish it that means it sure is a huge dish. Yeah the place cost a lot (ouch!) but completely worth it.",5,5/26/2006,Atlantic Fish
12,"When I came to Boston to visit my friend for a few days there wer two things on my agenda: visit my friend, and get seafood. We came here and I wasn't sure what to order. I'm a huge seafood junkie so everything looked good. When the waiter came and told me about the special, fresh pan-seared scallops, I was sold. I know it sounds crazy to pay $25 for 5 scallops (even if they were huge), but to this day those were the best scallops I've ever had, at $5 a pop.",5,8/6/2006,Atlantic Fish
13,Pricey but great seafood.  Everyone I went with really enjoyed their food - and most of us aren't even seafood lovers!,4,8/6/2006,Atlantic Fish
14,Came here with extremely high expectations..    Crab cakes : Excellent..  almost all crab with great flavor. Came with corn pudding which was excellent as well.Steamed Maine Lobster :  A bit overcooked.. i like mine really tender. So a bit of a disappointment there.Clam Chowder : So-so. It lacked a strong clam flavor which I deem a necessity.Chilean Sea Bass : So-so..  it was a bit overcooked. I like my chilean sea bass extremely tender. The Lobster Ravioli it came with was so-so.Jumbo Lump Crab Melt Sandwich : Awesome. I'd eat this everyday if I could. The sweet potato fries it came with were great as well.,4,11/13/2006,Atlantic Fish
15,"Solid, reasonably priced seafood.  Not too casual, not too stuffy.",4,12/3/2006,Atlantic Fish
16,"awesome seafood..the crabcakes, mussels and chowda are excellent..decor is classy (wooded and warm) ...service is fairly good...expensive..portions can be bigger..but overall a good experience..",4,12/8/2006,Atlantic Fish
17,"Although the atmosphere and crowd are not exactly my cup of tea, the fish is very good and the service is truly impressive. This is a good one to take the padres to.Oh and apparently their clam chowder is ""award winning"" I though it was so-so.Stay away from the Chilean sea bass....dry and icky....the fillet and lobstah' are great. The raw bar is good but honestly I've had way better.All in all, I am glad I experienced it, but will probably not be back anytime soon.....I would rather spend that much money at a place with more ambiance...",3,12/10/2006,Atlantic Fish
18,"Well, all I can say is, overall, I wasn't all that impressed.I came to Boston looking forward to a fancy pants meal and so we came here as we had heard good things. We shared the nibblies so we could try more things that the menu had to offer and the following is what we tried...Oysters (Don't even get me started on them. They were fine, but they also proved to me that I am allergic to them, since I spent the next 14 hours sick as a dog after eating two of them. Again, no fault of the restaurant I'm sure, but oy, no mas)The award winning clam chowder or chowda as I one in Bahhston would call it :) It was good. I have never judged a clam chowda competition and have only had it a hand full of times in restaurants, but it was tasty and thick and I could taste the potatoes and yeah, it was good. Not jump up and kick your heels amazing, but good.The lobster tail and filet mignon. Okay, I have been to some shady lobster joints in my day and even at those the tails were bigger than what this place offered. Are lobsters just THAT much smaller in Boston? Weird. The filet was most definitely my favorite part of the meal and it was cooked to perfection. The Seabass. Honestly, I don't remember it. That is probably telling you something.The wine. Very good. We got a half bottle and it was a spicy red and deelish. So the wrap up. Overall, nothing was amazing, but the place was super cute, the waitstaff very friendly and cool, the clientele was friendly and some lady ordered the calamari stir fry looking appetizer thingamajig and that looked really good.Would I go back, probably not, but for what it was, I'd give it 3 stars.",3,12/15/2006,Atlantic Fish
19,"Alright, I need a break from work. Rather, I need a break from the guys in the hall putting up new cubes. So, thought I'd continue writing.Atlantic Fish Co is one of the higher end, frou-frou restaurants. Well, that's what it felt like to me, especially when most of the people here were dressed nicely and I seemed like a bum with my jeans and a t-shirt. (And their prices seemed to fit in line with the clientele). Oh well, at least they treated me like I was any other customer, which was nice. Anyways, to the food!The Chowdah? Not really too impressed. Thought it was lacking something that would have made it much better. But what that missing ingredient was, I'm not quite sure. I mean, the clams were fresh and great, but it needed a little extra kick to it overall.My meal was the stuffed shrimp, which was pretty good. My brother's fillet was cooked perfectly, my dad's fish was fresh and delicious with the garlic breadcrumbs. My Ma had a salad, so I didn't try it, but she said it was ""very good"".Anyways, besides the weird faucets in the bathroom that suddenly spit out what felt was near-boiling water, this place overall was great. Service was pretty good as well; turned out our server was a recent transplant from SoCal, so we chummed it up for a bit.I think I'd go back here since I know its good, but I think I'd rather venture out to a new place just to compare.",4,12/20/2006,Atlantic Fish
20,there last week. decent oysters and cherrystones. tried to steal more of the cute little tabasco bottles but got bagged. the stella tasted off and was quickly replaced with my 2nd choice. we had 2 salads both were servicable but on one the greens were a little tired and the dressing too sour. to me this place is mid-level in the Boston seafood scene.,2,12/20/2006,Atlantic Fish
21,"We took my dad and now soon-to-be stepmom here for lunch yesterday. They were staying at the Lenox Hotel across the street, and there are a brazillion eating options in the Back Bay area, but we went to Atlantic because none of us had been there before. Nice ambience and extremely friendly waitstaff. Our waiter was just coming off of training but was very attentive, courteous, and prompt. I ordered steamers for an appetizer, and they were still pretty sandy, which kind of grossed me out. I ordered the lobster roll and it was decent. The fries are skinny skinny, but they were good--your average shoestring fries. I had a Magic Hat #9 on draught and it was yummy. The food was decent, but it's the service and atmosphere that really make the place. I really felt like they treated our party so well. I recommend it if you're in the area and want some good seafood. Bonus: they play the  Rat Pack as musical background.",4,12/30/2006,Atlantic Fish
22,"Although the wait time was extremely lengthy, the experience during the actual dinner more than made for it.  The waitress started off by carefully explaining the menu while making a good recommendation for a dinner wine.  The ambiance of the restaurant consists of plenty  of noise and packed crowds, which is not as desired if one's date is to be a quiet, intimate one.  The food is fabulous in every regard, as the clam chowder and crab bisque were delicious in their cute bread bowls.  My main entrees in the Northern Atlantic salmon and soft shell crab was some of the most juicy and tender I've ever had.  The place is by no means cheap, but its great place to enjoy the best of Boston and surveying the seafood of the Atlantic.",5,2/20/2007,Atlantic Fish
23,"Lets start with the one really big problem with AFC - it's not Legal and not the Capital Grille, but it tries to surf somewhere in between.  AFC is located in the perfect spot on Boylston and has great outdoors seating and the food is good enough - but it misses doing either seafood or classy really well.  This is not to say that the food is subpar or that the place is as rundown as 7 Eleven at 2 AM - but for the money you're spending you should try other places first.",3,3/21/2007,Atlantic Fish
24,"Definitely dug this place for drinks and apps with Natasha. Both the red and pink sangria were delicious (not to mention strong), the service was excellent, and both the calamari and the crab and artichoke dip were fabulous. One star off for some of the low-class patrons here...some 35 year old woman was so trashed she fell on her ass in the middle of the dining room. Go to Foggy Goggle if you want to behave like a drunken moron, this is not the place. It made me wish the management had asked her to leave promptly, instead of allowing her to remain at the bar, screaming her head off about falling down and how drunk she was. Otherwise, this was an amazing spot.",4,4/2/2007,Atlantic Fish
25,"We've been here many times, for lunch & dinner. I've always had a great time here, the atmosphere is fun, and the food and drinks are always good. The fried oyster app is amazing. It comes served in a brown paper bag, which I find so reminiscent of beach vacations. The lobster ravioli are incredible as well. Service here has been terrific, the staff are knowledgable about the menu, and are quick to offer recommendations if asked. Part of the BBRG, it came as no surprise that the service was above average, food consistently good, and wait for a table was at least 90 minutes. We'll be back, definitely.",4,4/7/2007,Atlantic Fish
26,What can I say....the service is excellent.  Not exactly a kid friendly restaurant but the manager went all out to ensure we have a great time with my whole family.  He even went out to buy  a coloring book and water markers set to keep my 2 year old daughter busy.  The staff was extremely attentive.The food was great.  Crab bisque is so smooth and sweet.  Bone-in swordfish is the way to go.  And also the crab cake entree....yum yum.  The reason why I didn't give a five star is because some of the entree came out lukewarm; but I think it's due to our big party.,4,5/22/2007,Atlantic Fish
27,"This place has amazing food. The tuna steak was maybe the best I've ever had. The appetizers I tried were also really good. However, in order to earn the fifth star, the prices at this place need to come way way down.",4,6/5/2007,Atlantic Fish
28,"Really nice interior, great service, and good food.  We were in the mood for lobster, after watching the Phantom's lobster special that Saturday morning, and decided to finally try this place.  It was pretty crowded at 8:45pm but we got to sit right away since we had reservations.  We split one big yummy crab cake as an app and for dinner they made me a lobster roll (even though it's only only the lunch menu) and G got the baked stuffed lobster.  The lobster roll was really yummy but the bread was a little too hard.  The B&G lobster roll was definitely better than this.  The baked stuffed lobster was really good but there was a certain spice in there that didn't belong.  But all of the lobster meat around it was PERFECT and the stuffing was pretty good.  We probably won't go back here as there are many other places to try... but it was a nice Saturday night dinner.",4,6/12/2007,Atlantic Fish
29,"Atmosphere is great, menu is extensive, price is about $12-20 per plate, depending on what you get.  Great place to go with your coworkers to have a meal.",4,6/12/2007,Atlantic Fish
30,"The best part of our meal was the warm bread served before our meal. I'm a sucker for warm, soft bread. I would say that this place isn't bad, but it wasn't really anything special either. We went there with a largish group (6 people) and had no problems getting seated immediately. Actually, the place was pretty empty in the back, although the front (outside) section was completely full. Both the hostess and our waiter were very nice. I had the seared salmon and watercress salad. The salmon had a nice flavor but the salad kind of sucked. I also tried the crab and artichoke dip appetizer which had a lot of crab in it and a nice texture, but still just tasted heavy and creamy. There are a lot of fried foods on the menu and boring sandwiches. Actually, I might have given this place 4 stars if I had liked their menu better, but I had a hard time choosing something which looked delicious, but wasn't $30 or more. (It was lunch, after all.)",3,6/18/2007,Atlantic Fish
31,"The food was good, but expensive. But am I crazy for expecting good service at an expensive place? Our service was terrible, and not just the waiter, but the busboys and manager as well.To start, we came here with a group of seven for a birthday dinner and ordered a few bottles of wine. I'd stupidly forgotten my wallet and they would not serve me, despite the fact everyone at my table was around 30 and (for better or worse) look around 30. I realize that's their job but even when the manager came over after I questioned the waiter she was really quite rude about it. Annoying, but not the end of the evening and I was still anticipating the crab cakes I'd heard so much about.When they brought our appetizers, they had no idea who's was what and seemed very annoyed that we hadn't cleared space for them. We had a similar problem with our entree plates, they didn't know what dish went to who they hadn't cleared our empty appetizer plates, so they just shoved everything into the center of the table, nearly toppling the wine glasses. We also had trouble getting our server to keep our drinks full, bringing new silverware, or getting our bill at the end. I've had better service at IHOP.The Food: I got a grilled calamari appetizer with a ginger sauce, good, but not particularly memorable - it reminded me of a dish I get at my favorite Thai restaurant. I also got the crab cakes ($29) which were great - decent sizes with big lumps of meat, barely any fill, and delicious corn pudding on the side.The place was relatively busy when we went, not a particularly stylish crowd for sure and the decor has a generic chain restaurant feel.For seafood places, I will stick to ECG. I would recommend only going here if you have a crab cake obsession, as it seems overpriced both for the quality of the food (great, not amazing) and quality of service (slow/inept).",1,6/23/2007,Atlantic Fish
32,"The service and management here is FANTASTIC.  We went here for a girfriends birthday and sat out on the patio.  We had some ""special needs"" and all of them were catered to....with smiles.  Our food was fantastic.  They had some good specials on the day we went.  It was very very busy and we still got good service.  All around a very nice little party for our special little girl.",5,6/25/2007,Atlantic Fish
33,"Boyfriend took me here the other night to celebrate the fact that I have very recently fallen off the ""No Food with a Face"" wagon and onto the ""If I can Kill It, I can Grill It"" wagon. ...all i have to say is, God damn it's good to be back. All because of Atlantic Fish. First off, yes, it cost more than Legal Seafood. This by no means makes it expensive in my book. Oysters from the raw bar are competitvely priced as is the majority of the menu. Seriously, for two appetizers, two entrees, and a bottle of wine the bill was extremely reasonable.Tthe food, service, and atmosphere here were all fantastic. Our waiter was very attentive and personable even though the restaurant was PACKED to the brim. I had the jumbo crab cake appetizer and holy good lord was it full of fresh lump crab meat (minimal breading) and seasoned to perfection. Seriously, this is what heaven tastes like. Moving on from that both Boyfriend and I had the pan-seared sea bass (he had the special which I should have gotten). The fish was cooked to perfection and the lobster ravioli that accompanied was so rich it was sinful.",5,6/25/2007,Atlantic Fish
34,"I had a business lunch there today and it was excellent.  We started with shrimp cocktail which features five good sized, perfectly cooked shrimp with horseradish and cocktail sauce.  For lunch I had the tuna tartare burger, which was not truly tartare but lightly seared.  It was served with wasabi mayonnaise and sweet potato fries, both of which were great.  I also had a very good key lime pie for dessert.  Our waiter was excellent and attentive but not overbearing.  All told a very good experience.",4,7/16/2007,Atlantic Fish
35,"This place earns five stars for the crab cakes alone.  Easily the highest crab to bread ratio I've ever seen in a crab cake.Delicious crustaceans aside, Atlantic Fish does very well for itself.  The atmosphere is nice casual, but the decor is honestly not that much fancier than a legal seafood.  The food, however, blows that comparison out of the water (no pun intended).The lobster ravioli is amazing, and the raw bar (while surprisingly limited in selection) is quite good as well.Furthermore, if you're looking to find a nice wine paring with your food, but aren't sure what you like, I suggest that you give their wine flights selection a shot.  You can choose from several prearranged sets of flights (wine samplers if you will) which they helpfully break down on the menu by taste (for the uninitiated) as well as by vineyard and region (for the wine snobs such as myself).Whatever you do, at least get the crab cakes as an appetizer.",5,8/6/2007,Atlantic Fish
36,"Good lord, Mr Waiter - turn it down a notch!  I do not need you to explain each and every facet of the menu to me.  I can read, really I can!We had the Lobster Ravioli (nice), oysters (yum!), and the grilled scallop salad (okay).Overall it wasn't bad, but I'd go someplace else before coming here again.",3,8/15/2007,Atlantic Fish
37,"Eh, it tries too hard to be a fancy fish place when it feels more like kids playing dress up. I don't even remember what I ordered, it was pretty boring. I think I had lobster bisque also- that was pretty good. When the fire alarm starts going off for over 20 minutes, it's probably best to have someone go and turn it off.",4,8/15/2007,Atlantic Fish
38,"When in New England you must eat seafood.  Atlantic Fish Co. serves the best crab cakes I have ever had!  Forget those breadcrumb behemoths you've had elsewhere.  Here you'll find lovely crabcakes with giant luscious chunks of crab and little to no filler.  The lobster roll was great as well - packed with lots of sweet lobstah, and just a touch of mayo.  The only thing I didn't love was its generic hot-dog style bun.  My dining companion ordered the Captain's Platter, which features fried breaded fish, oysters, shrimp, and scallops.  The scallops, shrimp, and fish were fab - the oysters not so much.  But when so much fresh seafood is available, why bother getting it fried?  Aside from the food, the atmosphere is clean and sophisticated.  Our server was extremely attentive, friendly, and helpful.  I would come back to this place in a heartbeat!",5,8/26/2007,Atlantic Fish
39,"My love for crab cakes has been rekindled-- nay, it has been passionately ignited.  Day and night I think about getting my grubby little hands on some of Atlantic Fish Company's crab cakes, but unless you give me $30 bucks, I will have to sit at home clipping coupons until I can garner enough cash to eat here again.  Seriously, where's my $30 bucks?I kid, I kid.  But hey, did I mention the Grilled Scallop Salad they've got here?  It's just magical.  I had a dream that I discovered a sea scallop the size of a Volkswagon Beetle, and in that dream, it tasted just like the scallops we ate at Atlantic.  That's what heaven must be like.",5,8/31/2007,Atlantic Fish
40,"I had read a couple of positive reviews about this place so I decided to check it out with semi-high expectations. For the most part, they were met   but there's always room for improvement especially when compared to Legal Seafood.We started with oysters in the half shell and they were decent although I think we should have gotten the crab cakes.Clam Chowder - ""Award winning."" That's how the chowder described and the only award it should have won was a thumbs down.  I've had better clam chowder up in San Fransisco from a homeless guy selling bread bowls and filling it with clam chowder from 2 liter bottles of Shasta. Delicious!Steamed Maine Lobster - No market prices here since we're in New England. The lobster was steamed perfectly with the right about tenderness. This is the only reason why I gave this place a 4 and not a 3.Decent experience and friendly service, but they could do better.3.5 if the system would allow.",4,9/4/2007,Atlantic Fish
41,"Atlantic Fish Co. was delicious.  The service was friendly and efficient, the ambiance was clean & classic, and the food was classic but not boring.  The bread was awesome, although they served it with those cracker things that I totally despise.  I  ordered the pan-seared Chilean sea bass, and it was perfectly cooked and very fresh.  It was also served with a side of lobster ravioli, which were excellent.  I also ate (stole?) some of my boyfriend's stuffed shrimp.  They, too, were fantastic.  So why only four stars, you ask?  Well, it's pretty pricey, and although the food is fresh and good....it's nothing I daydream about.  So, there you have it - great food that didnt inspire me.  Four stars!",4,9/11/2007,Atlantic Fish
42,"A little pricey, but well worth it for an excellent seafood dinner, especially for a special occasion.  I came here with a group, and we all really enjoyed the food and the service.I had North Atlantic Salmon which was very good.  My friend had the Giant Sea Scallops, and even though I'm not a big scallop fan, I tried her dish, and it was so delicious!  (If you read enough of my reviews, you'll learn that I often ""sample"" my companions' food, you know, for the reviews).  If you enjoy scallops, I highly recommend this entree.",4,10/12/2007,Atlantic Fish
43,"I dine here once a while with my parents.  I rather bring them here than legal seafood.  The seafood here, doesn't matter what we ordered from the menu, is always fresh!  Somehow I don't like the chowder here, too thick and salty.  But other than that, I always like to come here for American seafood.The bar scene is very nice too, although I've never sat there, but seeing and hearing such a polite crowd is enough.I recommend sitting on their patio during warm days, eating and people-watching.",4,10/16/2007,Atlantic Fish
44,"I've been to Atlantic Fish Co. a couple times now and I am still impressed.  The seafood here tops Legal, M&S and other top seafood places in the city.  You can get the usual slab of fish with sides or a seafood entree like shrimp fra diavlo.  My recommendation is to try the lobster ravioli, either as an appetizer or an entree. They're probably the best I've ever had.",5,12/3/2007,Atlantic Fish
45,"When I was 14 in 1995, my family came up to Boston for Christmas.  We wanted clam chowder.  My dad did a little bit of research and found out about Atlantic Fish Company.  We went there, and I had clam chowder in a bread bowl.  Then we visited Boston again in 1999, and went back.  Again, I had the heavenly, heavenly clam chowder in a bread bowl.  Oooh, and fried clams!  MMMM!  Fried clams!I moved here in 2004, and when my in-laws (they're from CA) wanted some good New England seafood, a lightbulb went off in my head.  Atlantic Fish Company!!  We went there, and everyone enjoyed it.  This is now the place we bring out of towners when they want some great seafood.   They always love it.   Another favorite is the lobster ravioli.",5,12/9/2007,Atlantic Fish
46,"In terms of high end dining in Boston, I would place The Atlantic Fish Company in the top ten.  It's not just the fresh and well prepared seafood that separates it from the pack, it's the elegant presentation and personalized service.  And, like a groupie outside a heavy metal concert, it's a sure thing every time.The moment we crossed the threshold into the Atlantic Fish Company, we were swarmed with attention from the staff.  Even before we make it to the hostess stand, someone came to take away our coats and welcome us to the restaurant.  Then, the hostess led us across a classically furnished dining room that mixed dark wood with navy and hunter green decor.  The sumptuous white table clothes, place settings and water and wine glasses arranged on the tables gave the restaurant an air of luxury.  It felt like you could be in a first class dining cabin on the Titanic.   Our waiter introduced himself right away.  He energetically described the menu, pointing out his favorite dishes but then backed off so we could have as much time as we needed to decide.  He did, however, place warm bread on the table that melted in our mouths as we perused the menu.The menu itself changes daily depending on the fresh seafood they have obtained from all corners of the world.  My table had great difficulty deciding on what to order- there were so many fresh, exotic fish to choose from coupled with their signature specialty dishes.  I decided to try something new and ordered the barbecued salmon with corn and shrimp salsa.  Mmmmm- such original and fresh flavor.  The salmon wasn't too heavy nor overly buttered and it was baked, not grilled.  The shrimp salsa was wonderful but disappeared quickly (the shrimp was so good I had to share).  I eyed my dad's scallops with pesto, artichokes and tomatoes that were served in a cream sauce.  It was very tasty and I don't even like scallops!  My mother had the mixed green salad with fruit, nuts and cheese.  The apples in her salad were grilled, yet another detail that separates this restaurant from others around town.  She also had the crab cakes which were delicious.  There are no details about The Atlantic Fish Company that are overlooked- everything is beautifully arranged and cooked to perfection.  There is even a man pushing a cart to swiftly take your finished dishes off the table.  Throughout the entire meal, I don't think we had to ask the waiter for anything- he ensured that our water glasses were constantly topped off, continually asked us if we needed another beer or glass of wine and walked by several times just in case we needed anything.It is compulsory when going out to such a lavish dinner to try out a dessert.  We elected for the carrot cake and it was one of the best pieces of cake I have ever had- just a hint of carrot flavor, rich icing but not overly decadent.    I would definitely recommend the Atlantic Fish Company for a special occasion or a night when you want to treat yourself to the best seafood in Boston.  It puts Legal to shame.",5,12/12/2007,Atlantic Fish
47,"This is a bigger place than it looks from the outside. And it gets loud. We were there on a Saturday night in January, and it was packed. I do get the impression that they are a mid-level restaurant trying to be fancy, but you know what? It doesn't matter. They actually served some really good dishes. They have a Catch Of The Day section where you can get the freshest seafood. We had a stuffed quahog appetizer, which was delicious, but was mostly chorizo stuffing, not enough quahog, in my opinion. I had blackened catfish with a sweet potato mash and grilled asparagus. At $19, it was more than worth it. But I am a big fan of catfish, a cheap fish. My companion had a seared tuna steak, also really good.All in all, we had nothing to complain about other than the noise, which is the result of such a large space. The food was cooked perfectly and was served very quickly. You'll get what you paid for here. I'd give it between 3.5 and 4 stars.",4,1/7/2008,Atlantic Fish
48,"wow! best restaurant experience of our honeymoon hands-down! (there's the short review. read on for the LONG one)our first night in Boston, we had diningin.com deliver us some chowder, crab stew, and mussels. the food was not bad with good portions and definetely fresh seafood. while i'm at it, let me throw out a quick thumbs-up for diningin.com. they only charged $6 to deliver and had the food to us 15 minutes earlier than promised. based on our experience and the reviews of fellow yelpers, we decided to give the restaurant a real shot tonight.i had a reservation, but  the restaurant certainly didn't look too busy to just walk right in and be seated. the hostess had asked for the ocassion when i made the reservation, so we were greeted with a hand-full of 'congratulations' from the staff. nice touch!our server was simply awesome! he knew his stuff, was VERY attentive, and easy to talk to. i normally only tip 15% to anyone regardless of performance, but he was so good i tipped more like 25% AND made a point to compliment him to his manager before leaving.the ambiance of the place is very nice. it's not super-swank  (business casual attire is just fine), but it's classy in a way that doesn't intimidate you into thinking you're way out of your league by being there. at the same time, this isn't the kind of place that's gonna have a bunch of random nautical crap all over the walls, either. it DOES get loud, but not to the point where you can't carry a conversation. oh, and they play big-band/swing music in the background. i LOVE that. bring the kids? well, not the young ones, but otherwise you should be fine.now, the most important part: the food! we started off with the crab cake since it seemed to be a popular one among the yelpers. as far as flavor goes, i have yet to have a better crab cake. however, i was disappointed with the portion (only one big one, good for just two people), especially since the mussels we had a few evenings earlier had a HUGE portion. oh well. for the entree, my wife had the surf n turf (lobster tail and filet). the filet wasn't the most fantastic i have ever tasted, but it certainly was a tender piece of beef (personally, i think she just had them cook it too much). the potatoes it came with were fantastic and the asparagus was pretty good, too. we both LOVED the lobster (i had the 2lb-er). honestly, i don't know how you could screw up lobster, but they certainly didn't. there's no seasoning that i could tell, but it didn't  need it. i had waited the whole trip for a lobster dinner, and i wasn't disappointed!prices are what you would expect for the kind of dinner you're getting. check their website for a sample menu (just be aware that the menu us re-printed daily based on availability) and you won't have sticker shock. wine prices were quite reasonable, in my opinion, with no glass being more than $10 or so.the final touch was the complimentary piece of chocolate cake they threw in for us for our honeymoon. i was honestly blown away at the act alone, and the fact that the cake was the most delicious, rich, moist piece of chocolate cake i've had in a LONG time (including my wedding) didn't hurt either.top notch place! definetely recommended. just be prepared to shell out some coin.",5,1/16/2008,Atlantic Fish
49,"This is an awesome alternative to Legal Seafood.  It's less of a chain than Legal's and I think the food is better.  I first found this place on a really cold night and honestly, any restaurant that got me out of the cold would have been good enough.  They were way better than good enough and I've loved them ever since for being such a nice surprise.  If I spent more time in the area, I'd spend more time at this restaurant.",5,1/19/2008,Atlantic Fish
50,"My husband and i went here for dinner, one night just for fun. Its really good food, i really enjoyed it, but the impression i got from the other reviewers, it wasn't that expensive... It might be because i am from the Midwest and relatively poor but it was expensive! Not insanely so, but 100 bucks for the two of us. I hadn't expected that and i figured i should make sure people know ahead of the time. Oh and the portions are actual proper portion sizes so don't expect a lot of food. Otherwise, it was really good food and i really enjoyed myself. I WILL be bringing my family there whenever they come into town since we can use that as an excuse to spend that much on ourselves. Otherwise, I'm afraid i cant go there as much as i would have liked to... its just too expensive for me and my budget... especially if i cant take the majority of the meal home and make it last for two more days!!!!",4,2/26/2008,Atlantic Fish
51,"Service was great, a little over the top even.  Food was tasty but nothing to write home about and certainly not worth the $100 we spent on dinner (good thing we had a gift certificate).   We had sea scallops and sea bass, and both were fine.  The corn pudding which I got as a side was awesome.",3,3/8/2008,Atlantic Fish

53,"I have been here many times. It's a good place to go if you want something a little higher grade than Legal Seafoods. In all of the times I've been here I've never been impressed. Usually satisfied, but never impressed. The good. The quality of the fish/preparation is usually a bit better than what you get at Legal Seafoods. The ambiance is a little nicer too.The bad. As I said above, I've never been impressed. They're consistently ""good."" I've had a few bad experiences. One time they tried to pass of Pacific (aka Alaskan) halibut as Atlantic... I wasn't pleased. Conclusion. Look, if you're thinking of going to the Legal Seafoods in the Prudential Center consider going here too. I believe it might be a little more expensive but honestly they're pretty comparable price wise. However, the food is usually a little better. Zagat gives them a 22 and from my experience I'd agree. I'd give them a 3.5 stars if I could. They get 3 because they're already rated 4 and also for the halibut fiasco :-)",3,3/15/2008,Atlantic Fish

55,"I walked in expecting a commercial, two-star restaurant. My mistake. Even at the height of the lunch rush, Atlantic Fish seated us immediately at a sunny table by the window. Our doll of a waitress, Celeste, conjured diet cokes and breadbasket within seconds. And though the Easter crowds were wrapped up against the bitter cold, we were toasty warm thanks to superpowerful floor heating.I got the scallop salad, which featured scallops the size of Texas. These scallops had a filigree of grill marks and a delicate, sweet taste. Scallops are famed for their nutritional properties (hello magnesium, vitamin b, omega 3, potassium) and these babies certainly healed me. Their luxuriant bed of fresh greens didn't hurt either.  And if the scallops were Texas, the oysters were the size of Africa. No wimpy rags of oyster here, no sir. We dined on delicious oysters from Massachusetts waters, plump and nourishing. Seriously, what are they putting in the water?One star off for an overly floured down crab bisque. Screw Legal. Go Atlantic!",4,3/23/2008,Atlantic Fish
56,"I could not rave more about this place, so I will make this to the point. I didn't have a reservation so I waited at the bar and had a fabulous cucumber martini; very unique! This was the best dinner I have ever had and one of my favorite memories of Beantown. I want to return to Boston for this restaurant alone! Surf and turf is my usual order at places like this and I have not one compliant about it. The steak was perfect and it seemed the crab had just jumped out of the ocean onto my plate. It is pretty expensive but this is one of the few restaurants that can and should get away with it.",5,3/24/2008,Atlantic Fish
57,"Atlantic is my favorite place for seafood in Boston, and one of my favorite restaurants.  They have the best crab cakes I've ever had (and I've been to Baltimore).   The bf and I like to go here for brunch. Last time we were there I started with a Bellini, and for something more substantial, the crab cake sandwich was next.  It had melted brie on it.  Holy crap.  The boy always gets eggs benedict with crab cakes.  I would love it if I liked hollandaise sauce.  They have a lovely wine list, and the service is always great.  Last time we were there the server was almost a little *too* friendly (yes, we're chatty and nice, but we're not actually friends, dude...).I always recommend this place to friends and have taken a lot of out-of-towners here.",4,4/2/2008,Atlantic Fish
58,"I was there Jan. 2008 and I loved it!!! The restaurant is beautiful and the service is great.  I had the teriyaki glazed salmon and that was very good; salmon cooked just right.  My mom had a local fish but I'm not sure what's it's called and she said it was very good as well.  My sister also ordered salmon but she requested for it to just be grilled, plain and simple and they were very accommodating.   We also ordered the mussels as appetizers and that was just amazing.  The crab cakes were very good as well.  You actually get big chunks of crabs on every bite...no imitation crabs here.  I also had to get a taste of their clam chowder...I was not disappointed, New England clam chowder for sure.  My experience was very good.  I'll definitely go back there when I'm in town.",5,4/10/2008,Atlantic Fish
59,"My brother and I hit up Boston on a whim so we chanced upon this place as we didn't have anywhere in mind but someplace warm to eat. As we walk in, noticed everyone tended on the older age range but casual nonetheless. Our server, Joey, was really nice and service was always on point. We ordered the clam chowder, caesar salad, calamari milano, and captains platter. We could have done without the calamari as portions are HUGE. Great prices and worth the try.",4,4/11/2008,Atlantic Fish

63,"The service here is very good.  On one occasion, they did not have a table open for our reservation so we had to wait about 15 minutes, which isn't a big deal but management offered us either clam chowder or something from their raw bar, on the house.  It was a very nice gesture.  we enjoyed the free chowders which was very good.This place is pretty expensive, plan on spending at least $50 (no including tip) per person, I don't normally drink so the bill normally isn't crazy.The food is very good.  Try items from their catch of the day or whatever it's called but the items are very fresh, the last time my girlfriend and I came, I had the Chilean Sea Bass and my girlfriend had the Giant Scallops which were both cooked perfectly.  We had the the cheesecake brulee, which was delicious.The only cons the last time I went was that we were seated all the way in the back in a corner table, it felt a little awkward because the two tables next to us kinda blocked us in.  And there was a draft of cold air coming down from the ceiling.  It was a bit uncomfortable but did not ruin the dinner.",4,5/5/2008,Atlantic Fish

Even better is that you can request a specific part of the restaurant to be seated at . . . they saved a window seat for us with the reservation, even with a packed house and more people coming in.But really, the 5 stars is for the food. I think I've had the best clam chowder here (full of potatoes and clams . . . and it's NOT liquid-y like that of most places in Boston), and some of the best salmon. Two thumbs up to the Barbecue King Salmon and Pan-Seared Sea Bass, and their sangria! It was oh-so-delicious. Our server, Matt, was knowledgeable, friendly, and quick with the service. Of course, when you eat that much seafood, there is little room for dessert. Despite not ordering dessert, I saw that they had a pretty good selection.

68,"I really wanted to enjoy my time at the Atlantic Fish Company and I did, for a while.  I will start off by saying the wine list was awesome big California Chardonnays, light crisp Pinot Grigios. The apps were also great, everything was so flavorful and  delicious, I couldn't wait for my entree.   We were sitting at an out side table and all of the trend setters were strolling by, there were candles, I had on a dress...it was all very cute.  Then our food came I got the grilled Tuna and my new boyfriend (now my husband) got the Halibut.  I tend to get worried when I see one of those lemons in the little ""sock"" thing, I truly despise that, seems more unsanitary than a regular lemon wedge to me.    The tuna was cold. I ordered it black and blue (hard sear on one side) and it was cold.  Many may argue that it's supposed to be like that but I say, bad timing on the chef's part and the veg was also cold and I ordered them cooked.  I asked N.B. for a taste of his Halibut and to my surprise, it tasted exactly like the fish I was eating.  How can this be?? Tuna has a steak like quality and a more rich flavor than that of the white, flaky, mild Halibut.  Oh, right, neither one of them were seasoned and both were clearly cooked on a flat top, a wet flat top. Some places will do that to hide th flavor of fish that isn't worth the 32.00 you pay for it.   I was sad...not because I thought that tuna and halibut were the same fish but because, this place is in a prime tourist hub, they should try to make the food as authentic as possible, not bland and accomodating.   Stick to apps and wine on the patio...save the cash that you would have spent on an entree and buy more wine and a safe cab ride home.",2,5/29/2008,Atlantic Fish
69,"As I was casually strolling along Boylston Street, Atlantic Fish Company caught my eye.  Although the other restaurants along the street had outdoor seating, this place looked like it had it all - a nice ambience and a great seafood menu selection, and it did.  I was going to sit outside, but I did not feel like waiting (yes, I'm a New Yorker).  I should have to complete the experience, but oh well.  I could not decide what to order.  I haven't had scallops in a while so I ordered the pan seared scallops with pasta w/pesto, artichokes and pico de gallo.  Yum! It was so fresh!  Also the pasta was surprisingly good.  Usually restaurants put too much pesto, but this was the right amount! During my next visit to Boston, I will definitely dine here again!",4,6/3/2008,Atlantic Fish

71,"The only negative thing I can think of is that our entrees took a while to come out. That said, let's move along.This is a fantastic restaurant. It starts with its great location on bustling Boylston St in Copley, among other fun places like Vox (post dinner drink? Yes please). The restaurant itself has that usual classic fancy look - woody with all the trimmings - and in generally pretty decent feng shui...not too crowded, but also not too bare.The wait staff was polite and efficient right from the get go, and continued to be through the rest of the night. Thanks to the friendly wiles of my dinner companion, we even managed to finagle some free dessert out of our waiter! Then again, you can't really say no to a pregnant woman. Unless the question is, ""are you the father?"". Unless you are. Hm. Awkward.The quality and quantity of food matches up with the rest of the restaurant in that it's satisfying and delicious. You'd be silly not to get one of the daily catches, cooked to your liking, blackened, grilled, seared, etc etc. While I thought the swordfish steak was a little on the dry side for my liking, the seared tuna steak was absolutely fantastic. Again its all personal preference, but I guarantee if you're a hearty seafood lover you'll find something on this menu you'll enjoy thoroughly. Oh, and the spinach and artichoke dip served in a bread bowl is da shiznitttt.They also sport an impressive wine selection, but with any wine selection don't be fooled by price tags - try something new, or get what you like, without paying too much attention to the price (don't blow the bank, you never know when you might need that extra fiddy...did someone say off-track betting??)All in all, I've been here a few times and have had wonderful experiences. It's a little on the pricey side, but this place, unlike many others, is completely worth it. So have yourself some dinner, a couple drinks, go see a show in theatre district, some post-dinner drinks at Vox, get trashed and hit the stripper poles at the Liquor Store, then to satisfy those munchies, stumble over to the happiest place in the world...CHiNATOWN.",5,6/13/2008,Atlantic Fish

My boyfriend and I go here once in a while for a nice dinner out and feel they have the best quality seafood in town and at the best price (for more casual/fine dining) as compared to other seafood restaurants in the area. We have never never been disappointed with our meal. We're a young couple and was a ittle hesitant on how we would be ""treated"" at a nicer place the first time (we've had bad experiences at other restaurants before) but at Atlantic we were immediately treated with respect by an extremely friendly and helpful staff. The raw bar is always excellent with different oyster selections. and their fresh fish selections change almost daily and you can get it done anyway to your liking. Occassionally we'll just hit up the bar for some of the best sangrias and oysters. Great vibe inside even though if you're in the middle of the restaurant it can seem really crowded.

The stew was so big I was only able to eat half of it. The bread was also delicious and I had to stop myself from asking for another loaf to dip into my stew.Once we picked our entrees, our server recommended a great, moderately priced, wine to go with our meal and it really was quite perfect.All in all, a nice casual, but well put together, seafood restaurant with fantastic food.

The others entrees included blackened scallops, salmon and a shoulder cut of sword fish 9which is not necessarily a well known cut to many)  but  certainly all our meals were worth every penny and reasonably priced I might add.

83,"I was in Boston with a co-worker for a few days and we wanted to end a very long east coast business trip with a decent meal. I wanted a lobster. I asked some of my local contacts for recommendations. I was told Anthony's at pier 4 and No Name are two great places and better than Atlantic. After reading negative reviews about the two other places, I decided to go against the local advice and eat at Atlantic Fish Company.The Atlantic Fish Company is an elegant white tablecloth restaurant. They served food until 11pm on a Monday night which was nice because we were on west coast time still and not hungry until later.We arrived and were promptly seated. We were promptly served fresh rolls and ordered a crab cake and ceasar salad. The best crab cake in my book was always at Legal Seafood. Well, Atlantic Fish Company now holds my title of Best Crabcake. The ceasar salad was great as well and I was offered the option of having anchovies topping it.The waiter had an above average knowledge of the wine offerings. We went with his recommendation and were not sorry. Their wine service is good, not a great selection but a nice offering all the same.I had the lobster. I was offered the option of having them remove it from the shell, which I took them up on. Their presentation of the lobster was awesome, all the meat was in a dish next to the upper torso of the lobster, which was situated so he could watch me eat him. The meat was hot and tasty. The waiter asked me to try the temperature while he waited to ensure it was to my liking. The lobster was served with potatoes and corn which were great as well.We were offered dessert. The waiter insisted their chocolate cake was ""exceptional"" and made with a high end chocolate. I have heard this line before and been disappointed all but once in my life. I took him up on it. He was right, it was exceptional and one of the best cakes I have had.Now, let's talk service. I had been disappointed by the service we received in every restaurant in Boston. One of my local contacts told me that generally service is very poor in Boston. Atlantic Fish Company was the only exception.Our waiter was right on with everything 100% of the time. He should write a book on good service. He was knowledgeable about the food and the wine. Everything was timed perfectly. Maybe it was the fact the he was from South America originally and lived in another state until 2 years ago. I complimented him on the good service and told him maybe he had not been in Boston long enough to become jaded.All in all, a top notch meal. I spent hours reading restaurant reviews before coming here and I am glad I did.",5,9/8/2008,Atlantic Fish
84,"Like another reviewer noted, Atlantic Fish has it ALL OVER Legals. Maybe this restaurant is where the locals go, and let the tourists go to Legals.This place even passed my parents inspection, and they're PICKY. Seafood should be flavorful w/o adding tons of fat (aka, they like fish steamed or grilled). I've had the grilled assortment at Legals... and it was BLEH. I got the pan seared sea bass here, and it was flaky, buttery, and accompanied by some steamed spinach and lobster ravioli. I also got quite a bit of the Asian Wok Salad, with an assortment of grilled seafood (shrimp, scallops...) which was served warm with a sesame dressing. AND IT WAS HUGE. Worth every penny.Can't wait to try the sea bass chowder next time!!(the ONLY thing that Legals does better is the bread. Ah... the bread).",4,9/19/2008,Atlantic Fish
85,"I got to Boston 8 years ago for school and a local told my family and I to go to Atlantic Fish and now I'm here all the time.  It's my favorite seafood restaurant!  They have qualtiy food and many choices.  They'll address allergies and make substituions so you will love your meal.  The servers have great suggestions and are very knowledgeable about the menu.  Great food and drinks, friendly staff, and welcoming atmosphere makes for a great time!",5,9/23/2008,Atlantic Fish
86,"Not sure what the buzz is all about.  Went there a few weeks ago when I was in Boston, and was not impressed.  Maybe I'm just picky, but I thought the food was very mediocre.  If you are gonna charge $40 a plate, I expect it to be above average at the minimum - it was not.  I was quite disappointed.  If this is supposed to be one of the best sea food restaurants in Boston, then I guess Boston's sea food standard is not very high.  The wait was about 15 min or so with no reservation - not bad.  Had a few drinks at the bar.  They sounded really good on the menu.  I ordered a champagne cocktail that was supposed to have Godiva chocolate liqueur in it but it was pretty much straight up champagne.",3,10/9/2008,Atlantic Fish
87,"Here, fishy fishy!Atlantic Fish.  Exactly as I expected, you were laden with wooden wall features and glass partitions.  Every glass was screened with your label on it (but it looked like smoosh).  You served pricey wines matched with pricey fishies, including 2 lb lobsters prepared all hacked up to pieces.  Strange, though I liked the warmed butter which looked like an aromatherapy oil heater.I can't say I didn't like my food, but I realized that I need to stop taking waiters' advice.  I ordered the Cioppino which was a medley of lobster, scallops, shrimp, mussels, clams, and some random fish, all simmered in a saffron broth.  Oh, the broth was tasty and well seasoned but man the seafood was very over done.  I should have opted for the Ipswich fried clams and salad (I know...it's tempting to go for something a little over the top at a restaurant which prides itself with fresh seafood, and not exactly typical).Yes, I was thoroughly jealous of Yan's scallop linguine and Dave's seafood Fra Diavolo.  But neither appeared extremely decadent.All in all, unimpressed, but a decent alternative to Legals.  I did expect more and got...just okay.  I highlight the word ""alternative"" but please don't discount the Legals option.",3,10/11/2008,Atlantic Fish
88,"I came here for my birthday and was wowed by everything. Maybe it was my date and how he planned every little thing so it was all amazing, but let me tell you what happened.As soon as we walked in, my date asked me to wait at the doorway and walked up to the counter and told them his name for the reservation. I was escorted to the bar where I sat and the bartender smiled and handed me a drink. I didn't even ask for it. I smiled and after a couple sips, they were ready for us. As soon as I sat down, our server whisked up and said, ""Hi, Julie! My name is Chris. So, I hear it's your birthday today!"" I was shocked and just smiled and nodded with my mouth gape. He smiled and handed me a menu I ordered what I wanted and in no time, the appetizers came. As soon as I put my fork down, wiped my mouth, and put my utensils in the position that noted to the server that I was done, a bus person came and grabbed the dishes. She hadn't gotten more than one step away when Chris, the server, came over from behind me with the entrees. I couldn't have been more shocked at how well everything was planned and how immediate and automatic these things were happening. It was like they had rehearsed this earlier (obviously not). The same thing happened with dessert where he came with dessert nearly simultaneously with the bus person taking our previous plates away only with dessert, it was a surprise. I didn't choose my dessert, he just came out with it. It was amazing. The food was great and the service was superb. I have never been treated better at any restaurant, much less my birthday. I couldn't recommend this place more. It was awesome.",4,10/12/2008,Atlantic Fish

Drinks ere top shelf, the salad was one I would order any time and the Patagonia Chilean Sea Bass was off the charts! My son enjoyed a large portion of Chicken fingers and great fries for $5.50. The chocolate desert was decadent and memorable. This is a great place and we will return as often as possible. Also: Guinness on tap & they know how to pour it!Visit & enjoy!Rob",5,10/24/2008,Atlantic Fish
90,"After having drinks at Sonsie (see my review) we headed over to Atlantic Fish for dinner last night.  Had a 7:00 p.m. reservation and were seated promptly.  Explained to our server that my friend and I hadn't seen each other in a while and wanted to catch up (aka we don't want to be rushed into ordering, eating, etc.)  She was very gracious and took our drink order while we chatted and looked over the menu... When she brought our drinks she said just to give her a signal when we'd like to order (her tip just went to a higher plateau for that consideration).  Upon ordering, both had the Toasted Goat Cheese Salad, which was excellent but could have had a more flavborful red wine vinegar dressing (actually tasted water-down).  For our entree I had the Pan Seared Sea Bass w/Lobster Ravioli which was delicious.  We had no room for dessert, but finished our bottle of wine with conversation.   Still, our server didn't make us feel rushed and turned out we were there for almost 3 hours!!! (We generously rewarded our server to her attentiveness.  An excellent dining experience",4,10/31/2008,Atlantic Fish
91,"I like this restaurant a lot for many reasons.The good:-Food is very good, not great.  It can be a little heavy for my taste at times.-they have the best cup of coffee in the city of Boston-environment is great- especially if you can get a patio in the spring-great service- not too pushy but very attentive without being intrusive-good drinksThe not so good--Overpriced for what it is which unfortunately relegates it to a ""special occasion restaurant"" for those of us who do not make 6 figures a year.",4,11/2/2008,Atlantic Fish

93,"Atlantic Fish Company has so much potential:  a nice enough menu, good service, a great space, the whole shebang.  But I have never been blown away by anything there, and that's a huge disappointment to me.  If anything, Atlantic Fish is up against a lot; it's located near so many other magnificent spots and the competition is thick.   It's just a tad too expensive for what seems like only slightly above average food at best.",3,12/8/2008,Atlantic Fish
94,"More like 3.5 stars.The food was pretty good in general.  Had a half dozen raw littleneck clams that were excellent and a nice pan-seared piece of sea bass with lobster ravioli.  For what you get, I feel like the place is a little pricey but it's still in the range of being acceptable.However, the service we had was downright awful.  The server had a hugely condescending tone when addressing us and describing the menu, seemed miffed that we didn't order dessert, and spilled about half a glass of water on one of us before trying to shoo us out the door for customers with deeper pockets I suppose.",3,2/4/2009,Atlantic Fish
95,Their sea bass  was huge. It was nice and clean tasting.. not too heavy. The lobster ravioli and spinach that it came with complemented the fish very well. The Cosmopolitans were also very yummy.

Another restaurant bar in the books...""The Fish"" as my favorite Asian-energy sucking-fiscally irresponsible-republican friend refers to this restaurant as looks like a steakhouse but please skip the beef in this place. I am sure the beef is great (the same owners run the neighboring fantastic steak house Abe & Louis) but when in Rome.....you get it right? I tried the pinot noir as an appetizer....no, seriously, the grilled swordfish is absolutely out of this world! It comes with sauteed asparagus and roasted red skin potatoes. The flavors in this dish are stunning. I licked my plate clean. Of course I dove into my favorite dessert of all time, strawberry shortcake. In a bipartisan effort my Asian republican friend assisted with a few fork-fulls of sweet berry ice cream heaven herself. Go here!

98,"Based on the crowd at Atlantic Fish Company, you'd never believe we were headed towards a depression.  The only thing I found ""depressing""  is that we were rushed out.  We came in at 9, and within about 15-20 minutes, several tables cleared and were not filled.  So, you'd think it would be o.k. if we had a more leisurely dinner. Maybe it was because we didn't order a full bottle of wine or app.  That may be code for ""please get us in and out quickly"".  And I fully understand that servers can't read our minds and we could have just said something. But when the check comes before we've even bit into the dessert, I get the message it's not o.k. to stay.  So, we quickly paid our bill and went somewhere else for an after- dinner cordial.Great, fresh seafood, lovely wine, knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Manager even checked in with us.  Nice touch.  Just plan to go when it's quiet or with a big party if you want to linger.",3,3/8/2009,Atlantic Fish
99,"I love it when my working friends take pity on my so-deep-in-debt-from-student-loans-I-may-never-get-out status and treat me to nice meals at nice places. On my most recent visit to Boston, I met up with two old friends who said ""Let's go to Atlantic fish. And before we get into an argument about it, we're paying. We're working. We're older. We're guys. You're visiting. End of discussion."" Awww, I love you guys! I'll treat you back...some day...Bread -- Yum! Crusty on the outside, warm and spongy on the outside. This stuff would make great bread bowls! As it was, we left the crust mostly untouched, and instead focused on gauging out the middle. I only wish the butter were salted.Appetizer -- Lobster Quesadilla to share, served with corn, fresh salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. OK, we all know that I love Mexican food, so there was no way I was going to hate this quesadilla. Slap some guacamole on anything and I'm happy. But this was actually really, truly, objectively good. The sweet morsels of lobster meat paired perfectly with the zesty salsa, and cheese goes so much better with seafood than I originally thought! Also, I'm a huge fan of adding sweet corn to salsa, so the fat juicy kernels were a perfect touch to the dish. Entree -- Maine Lobster Roll. Mmmmmm, lobster! (Hey, if lunch is gonna be free, I get to splurge a little, right?) The roll was heavy on the crab, light on the mayonnaise. A little too much claw meat, and a little too much lemon, but overall very very tasty. And what a generous portion! One half of the roll was the size of a normal sandwich. I ended up eating one half, and then scooping the lobster out of the other.Dessert -- Peppermint Pie. Ice cream mixed with crush peppermint candy, served on a chocolate graham cracker crust with chocolate syrup drizzled on top. OMG. SO. GOOD. Sweet and icy and minty! And chocolate-y! All food traits that I love separately, but combined = amazing. You better believe we scraped the plate.",4,3/8/2009,Atlantic Fish

101,"I don't often award 5 stars, but, w hen I think about the food, combined with the best service ever, i had no choice but to give em the full 5. The pan seared sea bass made a Chilean sea bass fan of me, and the lobster ravioli was Divine. My brother had the Ciopinno, and I have to say it was hands down the BEST ciopinno, we've ever had, and consider this we are from California, and San Fran is the Ciopinno capital of the world, and let me tell you, this Ciopinno blew everything we've ever had away. We started with the whole belly fry clams, and WOW these were so good, you can't get those on the left coast, and these clams we Uh-MAZING! so flavorful, and the breading was perfectly seasoned, and rich, but not a bit greasy.. The chowder here, and everywhere in the east it seems, was not my favorite, in fact I hate to disrespect the East, but I truly believe the West coast makes a better New England Calm chowder.. Anyway the icing on the cake was our server ""Jenna"".. Wow, probably hands down the Best wait service I've ever received.. she was so attentive, but not bothersome, when she asked about how I liked the chowder, and I said it wasn't my favorite, she immediately went to the kitchen to notify what appeared to be a kitchen manager (guy in a suit in the kitchen) and i saw him listen to her, walk over to the chowder and taste it.. wow i was quite impressed that they immediately took an interest in the customer feedback.. Very Cool! At the end of the dinner, we asked her about other restaurant to try while in town, and although her first allegiance was to her company ""you should come back here..."" Give that girl a raise!, She ultimately came back with a list of about 8 places for lunch or dinner, casual or upscale, and took time to give a mini description of each.. What can I say, this girl wen above and beyond, and if I could hire here, I would in a second! Great food Great Service, and a beautiful restaurant!! Good Job!",5,3/17/2009,Atlantic Fish
102,"I went here with friends for lunch while visiting Boston.The decor of this place is very posh. With the dark woods and frosted glass, you get the feeling you're in Thurston Howell, III's study. The ambiance, however, is rather laid-back and casual. This dual-personality is evident in the ritual of the hostess asking every guest if they'd like to check their coats -- whether it's a fine wool overcoat or a nylon windbreaker -- to which everyone I saw would turn down the request and hang their jackets on the back of their chairs like normal people do in restaurants.The service was very good and friendly. After the bread was served and consumed, the cheerful waiter came back with a crumb duster. That's something I haven't seen in a place that caters to the walk-in lunch crowd.I had an order of steamers to start. When asked what kind of clams they were, I was told that they're simply known as ""Steamer"" clams. In any case, they were good. I liked that the broth was not made with butter, as so often is done with steamers, which tends to overpower the flavor of the clams. There was a separate butter sauce for dipping if you choose to do so. Another nice touch was that the broth they were steamed in was served in a separate little bowl. The broth, after all, is the tastiest part! Great for dipping bread into. The only downside of these clams was the sand content in them. It wasn't a lot, but it did make them a little gritty when chewed.My main dish was the Tuna Bolognese made with whole-wheat penne. This was great! Very good pieces of tuna -- nicely seasoned -- in a light, tomatoey-creamy sauce. I'm not sure how they got the tuna to cook like this, but the texture was very much like ground beef (see photo). I only wish there was a bit more tuna. It really was good.Don't let the fanciness of the service fool you. The prices are reasonable for the overall package and this is a great place for a quick bite.",4,3/22/2009,Atlantic Fish
103,"We came here for Restaurant Week, but I'd come to AFC any day of any week.  In my previous visits, I've had everything from brunch to appetizers at the bar, to a full out feast (paid for by my father).  I love this place - it's always fresh and delicious, the service is always great, and you really do get what you pay for - especially during Restaurant Week.  The King Crab ravioli was amazing - and really filling for only getting four pieces.  I've had their lobster ravioli as well, but this edged that out - so good.  The clam chowder was fantastic as always - although I've noticed they took the crab bisque off the menu, which makes me oh so sad.  Anyway, if you want seafood in Boston, go here.  I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather go.",5,3/23/2009,Atlantic Fish

110,"So let me preface the review by saying that I usually don't like eating American seafood because it's boring. I am a huge fan of seafood though, so if I DO eat an American seafood place, freshness is key. And Atlantic Fish Company has fresh seafood.I had the seafood fra diavolo. The serving size was a bit small, but the dish was really really tasty. Another friend had pan seared scallops, and you can't lose with that. Another had the special of the day, which was some trout from Scotland or something. We all shared the raw platter, which was great only because raw platters rock. For dessert I had the peanut butter ice cream pie. That was great, but come on... peanut butter ice cream pie. Each one of the words in there is something delicious. Throw them together and you've got a winner.So I guess what I'm trying to say is that the food here is solid, but nothing super special (again maybe this is just me thinking that American seafood is boring). The price is a little high for me, but I was satisfied with my meal. Kudos on the wine selection and the service though!",4,5/12/2009,Atlantic Fish
111,"Al Fresco dining on a cool summer night in Boston...YES!  I was here for the first time on Friday night while I was visiting this fine city.  A local friend recommended.  We got there around 730.. after doing our own little local bar crawl.  I can't really recall the bar area since we were lucky enough to get seated outside quickly.  From what I remember it was a big bar with plenty of stools dark wood and at least a dozen brews on tap.  We were seated quickly and our server arrived within minutes to get our drink order.  I started with a double espresso since I was looking for a little help with catching my second wind.  I don't remember the espresso being too good, but it did the job.  We started with a few appetizers.  Initially it was just Cy, Jill, Matt and me and we tried the crab dip.  This isn't really my kind of appetizer and I found it to be really heavy although it did have a healthy portion of crab and warm tortilla chips.  If you like this kind of stuff I'm sure you would have been happy.  We also tried the clams casino and calamari I think.  The clams casino were really tasty and the calamari was lightly breaded.  Turned out we had a couple other friends in the area... Becca and Amy.  They wanted us to wait since they got stuck in the subway fire.  The waiter was cool even though it was going to take him a lot longer to turn the table now that we were waiting.  I ordered a very good dirty martini rox kettle one and we all enjoyed the people watching while we waited for them to arrive.   They finally... get there and we order our entrees.  Cy has the scallops, I tried one and it was cooked perfectly and tasted good.  Becca had the seared ahi tuna, which was melt in your mouth delicious and very fresh served with some nice bok choy.  Jill and Amy had the lobster ravioli which I didn't try, but they said it was really good.  Finally, Matt and I went old school and ordered a 2lb. lobster each.  I was happy to have it served as a lazy lobster although the presentation was a bit disconcerning with the lobster sat up right so it could look me right in the eye as I ate its claws... damn you crazy bug, quit looking at me.  I didn't even try the potatoes or corn, but I'm sure they were fine.  We had a couple bottles of inexpensive white whine of some type and were all pretty happy with the experience.  I'd say I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town, but with so many options it's hard to say.",3,5/14/2009,Atlantic Fish

115,"HAPPY TIME.Waitress - awesome.  She asked if I wanted a drink and I said to her my friends and I were going to go home and get sloshed on a bottle of sherry after dinner.  Her response was the upscale dining equivalent of ""right on"" and she never pushed the booze again.  She was helpful, accommodating, and knowledgeable.  She knew my friend and I were splitting a cut of salmon and brought it on two plates.We actually had to pull the manager aside...to tell him how awesome our waitress was.  Also, he had a pin-stripe suit and massive hair and we loved it.The best part, however, is that the three of us ate for less than $50 (before massive tip).  How?  Well, on the one hand we didn't order any booze or a desert.  But more than that - BREAD.  OMG BREAD.Come here.  Eat bread.  Seriously, if you want a cheap but wonderful dining experience just order a cup of clam chowder, award winning (though frankly I much prefer the crab bisque) and eat it with bread.And our wonderful waitress didn't push additional food on us or seem aggravated or skimp on the second bread portion at all.In addition to our soup, one of my friends got a lovely salad which was beautifully presented and a nice portion.  Another friend and I decided to split a fish fillet.  Atlantic Fish Co.'s fish specials are pricey in comparison to Legal and McCormick and Schmick - they're usually in the $20-$29 range, this place is more in the $27 to $35 range, with a few more affordable options.  We were considering the seared raw ahi entree for $34...but then we saw their ""Fresh catch"" menu at the top, listing different cuts of fish at different prices.  You pick the preparation and the two sides it comes with.Fair enough.  We got a fillet of salmon for $25 and split it, and the piece was so large that we both felt like we got a full sized portion.  They didn't offer a horseradish preparation on the menu, but I love horseradish on fish, so I asked the waitress if they can do something like that.  Sure! she said.  It came out with a buttery goodness sauce on top that had a little honey tang and the slightest subtlest hint of horseradish, but she also brought out a large heap of extra horseradish for each of us so we could add at will.Mmmmmmmmmm so delicious.  The asparagus and potatoes we got on the side were also quite tasty.The bread was the best part though. :D",5,5/31/2009,Atlantic Fish
116,"While this place is definitely a couple notches higher on the ""fancy"" scale I prefer to dine on, it was nonetheless a great place to eat because of the incredible food.The clam chowder bowl was one of the best I have ever had, and one friend I was with claimed it even rivaled Disneyland's chowder bowl (apparently between animation projects and developing ""the happiest place on earth,"" Disney created the perfect bread bowl-chowder combo). Also the fried calamari is AH-mazing...they cook it with hot peppers that add a truly incredible kick to the calamari. I've never tasted anything so good. I tried fried oysters for the first time, and while I have nothing to compare it to, I know delicious when I taste it...I would definitely recommend this item on the menu.",5,6/3/2009,Atlantic Fish
117,I love this place my boyfriend and I were in town and randomly stopped in this place we were greeted with the nicest wait staff. We sat outside and had an incredible lunch. fried oyster po-boy amazing......crab cake sandwich so good with sweet potato fries.as for wine the Naia went so well with food and to top things off the wait staff wasn't to bad looking as wellI thought it was going to be very pricy but my sandwich was about $12,5,6/4/2009,Atlantic Fish
118,"This place is really here for the service.  It was one of the best and most memorable dining experiences I have had.  After living in Seattle for a while I really had the fixins for some good east coast seafood.  Arrived with my date late on a Saturday night and we were seated at a nice table right by the window (close to outside, but without being chilly) as we were still dressed up from an earlier wedding that day.  (Could this be why the service was so good?)So when deciding on wine, we asked our server for a recommendation and were given really good descriptions of each wine, when still not sure, she offered to bring us a sample!  That was a first for me.  We sampled both and chose a delicious Italian white.Next we were looking at crab and my date was particular about the type of crab and what did our waitress do...she offered to bring a sample.  The sample was huge.. probably 2 ounces and unfortunately it just didn't seem quite right, but that was no big deal they took it away.When we went to order our server did not hesitate to recommend the crab saying fairly modestly that they were super well known for their crab cakes and that some people had called it the best they had ever had.  She also assured us that it was very much meaty and not too bready.  I went with one of those, a candied pecan and chevre salad with beets and a bowl of the clam chowder.The service was perfect - quick and adequate without being intrusive.  The food arrived and I started eating the crab cake which looked pretty good to me.  As the bus girl dropped off the crab cake, she walked away and then returned and apologized for the lack of crab meat that the crab cake had.  I was confused as I thought it was good, but she assured me that normally they have a lot more crab and that she was going to have a replacement sent to my table as to not tarnish the reputation of their crab cake.  Our server returned and offered an apology as well and said that another crab cake was going to replace the one I was currently eating and that I didn't have to return that one if I didn't want.  After this I was a little surprised because I hadn't complained or even really raised an eyebrow.  Then the manager comes over and greets us and apologizes once again for the crab cake.. it was starting to become almost comical and she explains that there must have been some inconsistency with the batter and they were remedying that.  So sure enough crab cake #2 arrives and it is packed with crab meat.The rest of the food was also delicious, but the kicker here is that on top of getting two crab cakes, it was missing from our tab at the end of the meal.  This place is really serious about their service, and their crab (Maryland blue by the way) and that led to a very healthy tip :)I can't wait to return here again for another great seafood dinner next time I am in Boston!I did come here one other time as well for lunch and had some of their amazing clam chowder and bread and was impressed as well to backup the one ""fluke"" overly positive experience.Forgot to mention the Classic Boston Cream Pie which totally hit the sweet spot at the end of the meal!Bottom line: this place delivers some excellent seafood and even better service.",5,6/13/2009,Atlantic Fish
119,Made reservatoin on a Friday afternoon thinking there was a brunch menu and once seated realized brunch is only served on weekends. I could not be any happier with my dining experience here. The sea bass chowder is the best soup I have ever tasted! The tuna tartar sandwich Amazing! The sangrias are delicious. Highly recommended!,5,6/17/2009,Atlantic Fish
120,"Best in Boston for seafood!!  Although slightly annoyed with the wait (definitely make reservations, even on a rainy Tuesday!), service was excellent, food was delicious (even though I don't normally eat seafood), and the steak was cooked perfectly.  What more can you ask for?",5,6/23/2009,Atlantic Fish
121,"Nothing more than Legal Seafood under a different moniker, if I had more options at 10 PM in Back Bay, I would have availed myself of something different. My lemon sole was competently grilled but my baked potato was overdone and my broccoli was under-done. My husband's sea bass chowder was marred by wayyy too much fennel and his pan-seared cod was utterly tasteless. We had a decent Sauvigon Blanc but this meal was worth only a fraction of its $74 total. Stop in if you are starving, but this is very far from a 'destination' restaurant.",2,6/24/2009,Atlantic Fish
122,"2 out of my 3 total visits have been wonderful!  The food has been great, service good (2 out of 3) and atmosphere was just what I wanted - room full of people enjoying their meals in a fast-moving restaurant!  If it wasn't for this last disappointing experience I had, I would give them 4 stars...Things worth noting on my 2 great visits were the stellar dishes and accommodating service.  Each time I had friends in town, when I thought of what seafood restaurant would showcase an across-the-board selection between fried/steamed seafood, fresh catches of the day, seafood entrees, steamed lobsters, raw bar, I thought of Atlantic Fish Company.  Their menu is perfect for this even though the price really does range and is not too cheap.  I have had the Lobster Fra Diavolo and Seafood Fra Diavolo - BOTH OUTSTANDING.  I love the flavor of this pasta dish -the garlic was perfect, the tomato sauce wasn't too liquid and was spiced perfectly!  Both linguine with either a mixture of seafood or strictly lobster.  What was amazing on my 2nd visit, was that I requested to substitute my mussles in my Seafood Fra Diavolo because I don't eat them, and the waiter was very helpful and even allowed me to add in some lobster.  That is what I call good service.  I enjoyed my meal, he went out of his way, and I put the restaurant on another pedestal.  For appetizers, their Island Creek Oysters are a must.   1/2 dozen for $15 is totally worth it.  These oysters are a good medium-sized and has a buttery finish, not too salty and not too sweet.  These are one of my favorites.  The fried clams were also good, besides the fact that their presentation is not stellar.  Very un-classy actually, as it is served in a folder over brown paper bag (like the ones you use to take to lunch)!  I suggest a less TACKY way to present fried clams.Also, they make a very potent Red Sangria (their main Sangria) that is just perfect.  Lots of alcohol in it and tastes wonderful.  I would've never expected a seafood restaurant to have a great sangria.As for my 3rd visit, my experience there was not wonderful.  In fact, service was unpleasant and the food was as well.  What was interesting was when I brought an out of town friend here and we sat down, the hostess did tell us 'Theresa' was the manager on duty tonite if we need anything.  (I decided at the end of the night to not make a scene to make a point to the manager, out of respect for my friend).Phillipe was our server.  Phillipe doesn't look like he wants to be there.  Phillip wasn't really paying attention to our table.  And, Phillipe apparently doesn't know the drink menu well enough! (He didn't even know the restaurant had a 3rd Sangria on the menu-- he couldn't answer my questions!) The 1st disappointing aspect of the evening was I had chosen AFC to dine at also because I finally wanted to try their Lobster Pot Pie on the menu.  To my dismay, I find that it was not on the menu (even though it was on the website earlier in the day).  The waiter tells me they discontinued the entrée.  Then, I proceeded to order my 2nd choice - one of the fresh fishes of the evening, the Louisiana Catfish!  A few minutes after we place our order, he comes back and informs me they are sold out.  At this point, I am very upset (not really at him) but at the fact that, my anticipated palate was let down twice!  Phillipe showed no sympathy, not even a, ""Oh, I am so sorry. .."" Instead, he suggested there were plenty of other fishes, yadda yadda.  Well duh, I can read, but why do you think I didn't choose the other fishes?!  So, I ended up ordering my 3rd choice--the Lobster Ravioli...I was so hungry when the food finally arrived and upon eating, I realized this dish was too creamy and a bit unsettling for my stomach.  Out of the 7 lobster ravioli's, I could only eat 3.  Phillipe never came back until the end of the evening when he asked if we were done.  ""Yes,"" I said. ""I couldn't eat anymore, because it was making my stomach uncomfortable.""  No word from Philippe.  He just took the plate away.  A very un-concerning server who definitely has a non-excited attitude.  If I was his manager, I would fire him, especially at a restaurant like that.  He doesn't make you feel welcome to 'his' restaurant and in 'his' service.Sorry AFC.  It would've been a 4 star restaurant, but service is just as important as food quality.",3,6/26/2009,Atlantic Fish
123,"Came here for lunch and was quite impressed. My cousin had the clam chowder and I had the crab bisque. Both were thick and with plenty seafood. Slurped down the soup with some AMAZING bread. I'm a huge fan of scallop, so I obviously ordered their daily catch jumbo scallop. I ordered it pan seared with mash potato and sauteed spinach. The scallops were fresh but a tiny bit overcooked. The spinach wasn't that great though. My cousin ordered the lobster ravioli and it is definitely one of the best lobster ravioli I've ever had. I absolutely love my waiter. Since I'm a first timer, he explained the menu to me. When he noticed how much I loved the bread, he actually put bread into my doggy bag. This place does not skimp on its ingredients and is definitely worth the price.  yum, yum, yum.",4,7/3/2009,Atlantic Fish
124,"Great fresh fish, and great location for a taste of northeast seafood.  Had the scallops and clam chowder for an appetizer.  Outstanding bread as well is served w/ the meal.  Only downside is that service seems to drop off a little after the initial interaction.  We had to get a busboy to get our waiter to bring the check.  Seemed like it happened to a few others around us as well.  One of the best things about Atlantic Fish Co is the outdoor seating.  It is a great setting, and the conversation will keep going as you get talking about all of the different kinds of people that walk by.",4,7/4/2009,Atlantic Fish
125,"I'd like to give Atlantic Fish Co. 3.5 stars, but since this option is not available, I'll be lenient and rate it a 4-star restaurant. I went to Atlantic Fish with a few friends for dinner last week. Service was good, and the restaurant had a welcoming ambiance. In terms of food, I'll start with their bread. It was crunchy and chewy at the same time. It was simply amazing! We then had fried oysters as our appetizer, but it was just alright. For my main course, I ordered the lobster roll, and I think this is where Atlantic Fish Co. loses 1.5 star. Although fresh, the lobster lacked seasoning. Most disappointingly, the bun was very dry and stale. I was really looking forward to having a delicious lobster roll while in Boston, and this restaurant let me down. My friends seemed to enjoy their dishes though. If you decide to visit Atlantic Fish, I would suggest that you avoid the lobster roll. They do have a large selection on their menu, so I might return and try other dishes next time I visit Boston.",4,7/15/2009,Atlantic Fish
126,"Atlantic is MY Legal Sea Foods. They are both around the same price point, but the difference to me is that LSF sucks and AFC rocks! If you read my review of Legal's you will see where I state that I've never had a good meal there. Atlantic, however, I've never had a bad meal. I ate here for about the 30th time tonight and left very happy, as always. I had the sea bass chowder which is insanely good, it really is. My friend and I split the lobster ravioli appetizer before our entrees in which I had to insist on. People, I've yet to have a better lobster ravioli....sauce and all. Finally for my main course I had the soft shell crab deep fried. It did stun a few people that I was stuck on the ceiling after my levitation experience from eating the crab. Seriously, I've never had it better than here. A little pricey but Goddamn, so worth it.",5,7/28/2009,Atlantic Fish
127,"Atlantic Fish Company was fantastic, I think.See, this place has amazing Sangria..I mean ridiculously good for a non-ethnic place.  So, long story short, I ate swordfish that I remember being the greatest piece of fish I had ever had at the time.  Seasoned to perfection, broiled to exactly the right temp, and served to me with sides that complimented the fish like it should.  Then I was wasted. I mean wasted wasted.But I can assure you one thing, when I passed out that night on the shoulder of a friend while at the top of the Prudential building, I dreamt of this fish. In the stay of mind I was in, I probably took that fish from spawning to hatching to plate.Regardless of my well being, it is an amazing restaurant. Service, decor, food (both presentation and taste) are superb. Next time I'm on Boston, I'm there....and this one I'll remember",4,7/31/2009,Atlantic Fish
128,"This was my last stop for a bite to eat during my three-day stay in Boston. After a long day of walking all over Boston, my friend and I went to this restaurant for brunch in search of good clam chowder. We both shared a clam chowder bowl, crab bisque bowl, and a jumpo lump crab cake pesto melt. The clam chowder didn't scream ""cream!"" and had a pleasantly mild seafood aroma. The chowder itself was quite chunky and filling and the bread bowl was also delicious. The crab bisque also hit the spot and had quite a bit of crab in it. Both were delicious in their own way -- difficult to compare. The jumbo lump crab cake melt was also very good, and our waitress was very helpful as she had already split the sandwich in two. I was a big fan of the sweet potato fries that came on the side. They reminded my friend and I of satoimo tempura in Japan. At the very beginning of the meal, they also served some warm bread and sesame sticks which were very good. The quality of bread at this restaurant was excellent, and the different types of bread complemented the seafood perfectly.With tax and tip included, it came out to 20 bucks per person. Both the clam chowder and crab bisque bowls were 8 bucks each, and the jumbo lump crab melt was 17 bucks. A little on the pricey side, but it was a very classy restaurant, we had a nice view inside the restaurant by the street (perfect for people watching), and our waitress was very helpful as well. Overall a great way to end my trip with a friend from my middle and high school years who I hadn't seen for seven years! They also had outdoors seating, but it was a little humid so we chose the AC'ed interior instead.",3,8/2/2009,Atlantic Fish
129,"My first lobster meal in Boston. We didn't make reservation at all and we got a seat outside right away for dinner time.Lobster was huge and delicious. I was more impressed by the Mahi Mahi my friend ordered. It was on the special menu and it's definitely worth trying.I liked sitting outside. Well there was this fire truck that wouldn't leave while I was there... they were noisy and annoying. But other than that, they deserve a 5 star.",5,8/12/2009,Atlantic Fish
130,"I was in Boston for a total of 6 hours, and it was the mid-afternoon, so I wasn't meal-hungry, but I had to have some Chowdah and a Sam, and the Atlantic Fish Co seemed like just the place.So I sat at the bar and had a Sam Adams, a cup of Chowder and an order of Calamari before hopping in my van and heading back to Albany for the night on what was the 6th day of my 10-day San Jose to Boston to Denver road trip... but enough about me.The calamari was great, the chowder was great. I can't really say much, they were staples. I wish I had been hungry enough or had a little more time to sit down and check out an entree, but I thoroughly enjoyed what I had.The bartender - I forget her name, tall blonde girl, started with an A, I think - was really great. Her service was excellent, and she struck up conversation with me. I think she was as excited hearing me talk about California as I was to be in Boston (and I was pretty excited)When I make it back to Boston (and especially if I'm able to bring my wife and not have to eat alone), I'll make to sure stop in and have an actual meal.",4,8/14/2009,Atlantic Fish
131,"i went here for Restaurant Week during lunch. The interior design was amazing: model ships and rich wood paneling. The service was also great, our waiter came to check on us after each course. They also brought out the food on little carts which was cute and convenient. The complimentary bread was also good, nice and crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. On to the food:I ordered clam chowder, mussels for entree, and peppermint ice cream pie for dessert. All three were delicious! The clam chowder came in a small cup but it was pretty creamy and had loads of stuff so it was actually more than it looked. It had a rich clammy aftertaste, which I loved. I forgot what kind of sauce the mussels had but it was like a vegetable puree with bits of cheese (whatever it was, it was good). It was a good portion, tasted fresh, and came with a basket of fries that tasted like In and Out fries (small and crispy). Peppermint ice cream pie is a first for me. It was white with pink swirls with a chocolate cake base. So YUMMY. I would def come here again and order from their regular menu.",4,8/28/2009,Atlantic Fish
132,"Blackened. Swordfish. Amazing. I die.The Atlantic Fish Company is located in the heart of Boston, with outdoor seating and open dining room seating, it just screams ""Come inside,"" which i love. The service was okay, definitely could have been better.Parking can be really difficult, so either park in the parking structures across the street, or valet. The food was good, but I've had better Linguini with Clams. However, the star of the night was the blackened swordfish steak that I ordered. It was so moist and blackened perfectly. The seasoning had some spiciness, which I'm a huge fan of. My dad had the steak - weird, I know, especially because we went to a seafood restaurant - but it was well cooked. The potatoes and the french fries here are really tasty.The food here is a bit over-priced, but that's what you get for eating in the city. I recommend this place for sure!",4,9/1/2009,Atlantic Fish
133,"Great ambiance (including a nice patio area that was great for people watching), yummy drinks (I got a mango peach cosmo which was delicious -- wasn't too sweet like some cosmos can be) and yummy food.  Ordered seared scallops with new potatoes and green beans on the side.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and the portion was larger than I expected (usually you get 4-5 scallops, this was more like 8-10!).  My friend got the fried shrimp basket and said it was pretty tasty as well.  We left very full and happy.",4,9/2/2009,Atlantic Fish

136,My first visit and first dinner of my trip in Boston.  With numerous eateries to choose from based on recommendations from friends I decided to go with Atlantic Fish Co. which wasn't even a choice on my list.  I happen to stumble upon some reviews on this restaurant and decided to take a chance to try it out.  Boy am I glad I did.If my friends and I had came in 5 mins later we would have to wait 30-45 mins.  We were lucky enough to get seated right away with 1 table left open.  I suggest you make reservations if you are going after 8pm.  After getting seated a bread basket of fresh sourdough and sesame flatbread crackers were placed on our table.  We ordered fried oysters to start off with which was surprising good.  I had the blackened chilaen sea bass with sauteed spinach and rice pilaf.(u can choose any 2 sides)  It was a very tasty and the rice pilaf and spinach complemented the saltiness of the spiced fish really well.  I also had a cup of clam chowder.  Boston sure has the best clam chowder I've tasted so far.  I suggest you order the cup instead of the bread bowl cuz the restaurant gives u sourdough bread to start off so no need to fill up on more bread when you can save room for more yummy food choices.   My friend order their special for the day which was also very good.  Meat was moist and buttery.   I recommend this place to anyone looking for good fish and seafood and good ambience.  The waiters are very friendly.,4,9/11/2009,Atlantic Fish
137,"We arrived at 8:15pm for our 8pm reservation, upon walking to the restaurant I noticed it looked packed inside and hoped we didn't have to wait, but they sat us right away at what looked like the only table left in the whole place, all the way in the back.Our server was excellent, he was very attentive, but not over bearing.  Gave us the perfect amount of time to order appetizers and then our entree, and gave great recommendations.  Top notch service.Food - we started with the ahi tuna appetizer and it was amazing.  Wonderfully cooked, barely seared on the edges.  It could have used a bit more of the soy sauce sauce, but overall it was delicious.  I also had the crab bisque - YUM.  Not sure if I want lobster bisque after having this, lol.  Not a lot of crab meat, but I came across a huge piece of crab meat, it was over an inch big.I had the 1.25lb Maine lobster, served with new potatoes and corn on the cob.  I paid extra for the shrimp stuffing.  If I ever go again, I will not get the stuffing though.  It was good, but there was a lot of parsley in the stuffing, and I don't like parsley, so I couldn't eat too much of the stuffing. The lobster was cooked wonderfully - this is what I came to Boston for - lobster!  My date got the NY strip as he doesn't eat seafood.  It was good at the beginning, but the longer it sat, the more it cooked, and by the end it was pretty dry and tasteless, but oh well, you don't go to a seafood restaurant and get steak, this the steak didn't affect my 5 star rating.Dessert - We got the lemon sorbet - and it was just okay.  I don't know if they put a glaze on it or what, but it was a lot more gooey than other sorbets I've had, but it was nice and refreshing.  We also got the Boston Cream Pie cake, and it was very good.  Our waiter described it as a ""juicy cake"" I think he meant ""moist"" but didn't know the word.  A juicy cake is not appetizing, but a moist cake is :)  It was very good, nothing special, but sweet, and it was moist.After 2 apps, 2 entrees and 2 desserts, our bill was under $100 - WOW - very reasonably priced.  Next time I'm in Boston I definitely want to come here again.",5,9/13/2009,Atlantic Fish
138,"Sorry to be so tough, but in Boston, the expectations for a seafood restaurant are pretty darn high (think Legal Seafoods before they sold out and went nationwide).  It was okay ... yeah, just okay.Very crowded, typical East Coast restaurant atmosphere.  Had a very nice glass of Verdeho to start with, then a cup of the Sea Bass chowder with bacon, corn, peppers, and potatoes, which sounded amazing but which was actually only so-so. Not much fish, and despite the seemingly favorful range of ingredients, it didn't pack the punch of a really outstanding chowder.  I followed this with the grilled scallop salad, which was also a disappointment for an East Coast seafood restaurant.   The salad was actually not bad, with pine nuts, cranberries, and goat cheese, but the grilled scallops were AWFUL!  Gummy and overly cooked (almost charred) on the outside.All in all, can't recommend it.  The bartenter Jonathan couldn't have been nicer, and it was an okay atmosphere, but when I'm in Boston, I want Proustian seafood meals, and this definitely wasn't one of them.",2,9/14/2009,Atlantic Fish
139,"YUMMY - Based on a tip from a Charilie's waiter at lunch, hubby and I sought out the Atlantic Fish Company (AFC) for more good eats.  AFC was a great stop.  Though it was Friday evening (8pm) we had virtually no wait.  After seating us, the wait staff was quick to take our drink order and offer suggestions from the menu and to state chef's specials.  The setting was cozy, candlelit, and semi-romantic (ahhh)...more on the food.The raw bar had a great selection of yummies which I fully indulged in.  I think hubby is becoming a fan of the raw too.Our main courses were just heavenly and I don't think we were the exception.  Every bit of food that passed our table looked and smelled amazing.  The aroma's wafting through the air were really divine.  I enjoyed the sauteed Atlantic cod, which was cooked to perfection.  Hubby gobbled up the lobster ravioli.  It must have been good because he was really reluctant to share with me.  AFC was all good and a perfect end to our first day in Boston.",4,9/15/2009,Atlantic Fish

145,The sister seafood restuarant of the popular steakhouse A & L's next door tries to outdo Legal but does it work? I think they do a good job. The round sourdough bread is great as they serve it warm. The mood is less formal than a steakhouse. The problem is it's a typical New England seafood menu and you can find the same at Legal or Summershack or Skipjack...which can be sort of boring.,3,10/3/2009,Atlantic Fish
146,"I recently went in to the fish to eat and was completly wowed. We went into a crazy busy restaurant and was greated by the best hostess team I could ever imagine. Not only was the hostesses super friendly, they were also really good looking. I was then greated by the over friendly manager, Teresa. We were sat immediately in a great booth right next to awesome pictures of boats and a miniture model of one of the ships of the paintings! Super coool! The last time I went in, Andy from AZ waited on us and he really impressed the pants off of us. Plus he was super cute.Our meal was the best seafood we have ever eaten in the whole Boston area. We met the chef, Danny, who made every dish mind blowing. Ronnie was also there and made sure our calamari was cooked perfectly. We liked his style. In additionto the chefs, we also met Paul, Lenny, Parker, Jay and Dimitri. They all deserve promotions or personal high fives! We will be back for the super great service! We were really upset we couldn't meet the super talented GM to give him thumbs ups for our great experience! What a nice package! Can't wait to go back!",5,10/8/2009,Atlantic Fish
147,"I had wonderful salmon here... something I actually wasn't going to choose but the waiter talked me into ordering. It was fantastic! The waitstaff is very helpful, and the food is delicious. The pink sangria was pretty good, but not very strong. Overall, a decent price for amazing food!",4,10/13/2009,Atlantic Fish
148,"Perhaps I walked into the Atlantic Fish Company with too much expectation from this place. This was my first trip to Boston and was excited to consume a great lobstah dinner! We decided on trying Atlantic Fish Company on recommendation since friends said they were better than Legal...which is much more touristy.We made reservations for a late dinner at 9:30pm for a party of five.  They seated us promptly.  Noise level was a bit louder than normal since there were some brave Yankee fans watching the playoff games versus the Twins near the bar.Since there were five of us all wanting lobster. We ordered TWO, yes two orders of their, ""New England Lobster Feasts"" Each feast consists of a two pound steamed lobster served with clam chowder,mussels, steamers, corn on the cob, and potatoes. This feast is geared to serve two.Clam chowder was delish! We ordered the lobster ravioli appetizer which was also very tasty! Then came the lobster feast. Very disappointed. The tail was like eating rubber.  Tough, chewy, not sweet, and way overcooked. Had trouble cutting it with my knife even. That's a bad sign!  The claw was ok. I was tempted to complain to our server and regret that I didn't. Mussels were good, the steamer clams on the other hand terrible! There was so much sand inside the clams that I literally could feel each crunch of sand in my teeth. Maybe I just got a bad steamer clam with sand. So I tried eating another, then another. The more steamers I ate, the more sand I had to spit out!  The kitchen did a terrible job in cleaning/soaking/rinsing these clams. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't soak them which is a FDA recommendation before serving.  If I wanted to eat sand, I would have gone to the beach!We did share a Boston Creme Pie for dessert which made up for the terrible New England feast.I'm sad to say that I was disappointed with our meal considering how much we spent on ordering lobster. Traveled across the United States to have a horrible lobster feast.",1,10/14/2009,Atlantic Fish
149,"My friend who is from Boston, but lives in NYC, raved about the Atlantic Fish Company.  There was absolutely no reason for me to question her decision since all of her recommendations in the city are always fabulous.  She grew up in the Boston area and since this was her favorite restaurant, 3 /12 hours on the train with my 6 year old, we were psyched for dinnah!!!!!  Well, I have to say, it was terrible.  My first night in Boston in 15 years, we could have gone anywhere and unfortunately, it was a grave disappointment.  The food was luke warm to room temperature.  We ordered a glass of Simi and decided to get a bottle.  The waiter poured the bottle of wine into our old glasses, not bringing new glasses.  They bought out our entrees without clearing our appetizer plates looking at us as if we should move them.  I was so upset, I didn't know what to say.  I did complain to the waiter and he looked at me like a deer in headlights.  I forgot to mention that my daughter, who LOVES muscles, hated them, so I got her a grilled cheese and she didn't even like that!  I have to admit, most of what we ordered was tasteless but I ate it anyway out of sheer starvation.  Remember, I just got of the train from NYC.  I don't know what would have made me happy, maybe a complimentary dessert offering but at least something.  They charged us for everything, not offering us anything for our dissatisfaction and needless to say, I will not go back. I don't recommend this place since there are so many fabulous places to eat in Boston!  In fact, the next night, we walked Beacon Hill and found a nondescript Thai restaurant and had the best meal.  No, the wine wasn't the greatest, but it WAS the greatest because the wait staff was so nice and the Pad Thai was simply the best.  We also sat by the door which kept opening and it was cold, but it was fun and I would go back!  Get my drift???",1,10/18/2009,Atlantic Fish
150,"Holy Lobsters!!! Ok this was my first Boston seafood experience so I have nothing to compare it locally but I have to say they had some of the largest lobsters I have ever seen.They brought one out for the table next door, and I swear I saw the lid of silver platter raise up and this claw wave at me. Ok so that didn't happen but when they did open the lid that lobster was overflowing the platter.New England Clam Chowder -- I never knew I liked this until I had it here, it was really tasty and the clams were fresh!!Lobster Roll -- delish, would probably opt for the whole lobster next timeDrinks were fabulous here too!My husband and I split the above as a late lunch when we got to Boston, this kept us full for several hours.Ambiance: Seafood restaurant casualService: Our waitress was super helpful, she made lots of recommendations and even gave us tips on places to try after dinner so we won't be relying completely on our concierge woman who was 25 years older than us.",4,10/20/2009,Atlantic Fish
151,"I went here on Friday night for the first time. The place is very clean and the staff are organized, although it has the feel of a chain restaurant. I got oysters and grilled calamari for appetizers. The oysters were okay and the calamari was very good. It was grilled and had a smokey flavor. For dinner I got seared scallops over pesto linguine. This was a good dish, but not the best I've had. My girlfriend got seared sesame tuna, which was good not great. The service was good, but had a pre-packaged feel to it. Overall, the place was okay but very generic.",3,10/24/2009,Atlantic Fish
152,"I stop in here quite often. The prices aren't bad, the food is good. The service is always fast & friendly. In the evenings it does get fairly busy. If you are in the mood for sea food & drinks ith friends this is the place to go.",4,10/26/2009,Atlantic Fish
153,"Went here about a year ago for my friend's birthday.  We sat at a large table for about 15 of us.  I ordered a white wine since I knew I would be getting some type of fish duhI got the sword fish which was great and came with a side of veggies and potatoes which had a sweet sauce on them that was amazing.  I tried my friends Chilean Sea Bass which was nice, buttery, soft, and melted in my mouth!!The place is very expensive and maybe a once in a blue moon occurrence.  I spent about $50 for the sword fish steak and one glass of wine.  I think also the fact of being in a large party added to the price.  You're paying for the location on Boylston and the atmosphere.  It wasn't so phenomenal to keep me coming back for more.  One thing that sucked was that my friend, who was the birthday girl, left her ID at home and the waiter made her go all the way back home to get it. Come on now, she looks grown, we are all grown, it's not that serious.  He ended up giving the drink to her for free. I guess it was worth it in the end.",4,10/29/2009,Atlantic Fish
154,"I had the Costa Rican Mahi Mahi served with Patatoes and Broccoli for the late lunch on Tuesday. The food was awesome and delicious..The staff was friendly, the service was excellent and the order came out on time.

Definetely a 5 star",5,11/12/2009,Atlantic Fish
155,"You want seafood? This is a good place to get it.  It's a fancy restaurant so the prices are what you would expect.  However, the quality of the seafood is great, and if you're ready to splurge this is the place to do it.Came here with a group of friends and had lots of things.  Crab bisque, clam chowder, steamers, oysters, lobsters.  Everything was good.  Can't complain, though I definitely can't afford to eat here often.",3,11/26/2009,Atlantic Fish
156,"I recently yelped this place out and I have to say WOW! Thanks for the great reviews. Food, drinks, service, etc....awesome. Be sure to make reservations. This place seems to be very busy even on a Sunday night! Started off with the mussels - delicious. I'm not even a big fan of mussels but these were super flavorful and yummy. Next we ordered soups and salads. I'm not going to lie, the Clam Chowder was the best I have EVER had. Make sure you grab at least a cup! For our entrees we ordered the catch of the day salmon as well as the tuna steak. Both were excellent. We also ordered the fish in chips and a blackened swordfish special. All of our food was cooked/seasoned to perfection. Nothing but yums across the board. For dessert we ordered the peppermint cake, the chocolate mouse, and the apple pie. Again, wonderful. Also, I would like to take a minute to note the excellent services. Our waiter, Ryan, was amazing -- great sense of humor and a steady server's hand. All in all, this place is pretty pricey but it wont disappoint. Enjoy!!",5,11/30/2009,Atlantic Fish
157,"The BEST clam chowder in a bread-bowl I've had in my entire life!  At $7, it's a bit pricey for a soup, but it is a classy seafood eatery with the white linens and extra-polished silverware and wine glasses and all...Their calamari was also pretty spectacular and the oysters very fresh.  Not a lobster fan, I refrained from ordering it, but my dining companion seemed to love it.  A five-star service and elegant, comfortable atmosphere.  I'd definitely return for more delicious, fresh seafood next time I'm in B-town.",5,12/2/2009,Atlantic Fish
158,"At first glance this seemed like an overpriced formulaic seafood themed place. But, we were pleasantly surprised. All the seafood was expertly prepared and quite tasty.

159,"Stopped by while on vacation in Boston. Walking around the Back Bay area and decided to come in for dinner on a Sunday night. We had to wait 20 min for a table, but considering we didn't make reservations, it wasn't that bad.  We seemed a bit underdressed and touristy, but were treated very nicely.The wife and I weren't very hungry, so we decided to have Chowda and the lobster ravioli.  Both were very tasty and we were quite satisfied. The bread was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and went well with both the Chowda and the ravioli sauce. Overall a very good experience",4,12/3/2009,Atlantic Fish
160,"Excellent bread, wonderful snapper special, reasonable wine, good service.  This was my first visit and I was very pleased.  It is a little pricey, but overall it was a very nice quality to price ratio.",4,12/23/2009,Atlantic Fish
161,"The restaurant makes you feel comfortable and I love the view of Boylston street from the 2 tops by the window.  The menu is vast with so many decisions.  Service was good and overall the restaurant was a good experience, nothing bad, nothing good but nothing memorable.  We started off with brunch cocktails of a spicy bloody mary and a mimosa with freshly squeezed OJ. However the champagne tasted stale.  Since it was just 12pm I was tempted to get freshly shucked oysters but got the Ahi tuna - bad mistake.  It was ok.  Entrees were the lobster roll and the eggs Benedict with a Maryland crab cake.  The open faced sandwich was filled with chunks of fresh lobster and lightly whipped mayo.  The eggs Benedict was overpowered by the Bearnaise sauce, but when you did find the crab cakes under the small poached eggs, it was a hidden treasure.  Both meals were good, nothing bad.",3,1/2/2010,Atlantic Fish
162,"Do you want the good or the bad first?I think I'll start with the good so I don't come off as a complete cynic from the get-go.  We had read a lot of really good reviews and so we had very high expectations of the place.  I have to say the food and the drinks were right on the money when it came to our expectations... zingy calamari, melt-in-you-mouth buttery-creamy lobster, perfectly executed Seafood Fra Diavolo, and delicious blackberry champagne.I can't exactly put my finger on the negative vibes I got but I think it was a combination of a few things.  The tables were put together pretty tightly making it hard to hear the people next to you if you were next to a more boisterous bunch, not to mention getting hit in the back with other people's chairs when they lean back or go to the washroom.  The wait staff was very nice and friendly but it was almost a bit of overkill.  I found my self thinking they were putting on happy heirs and the entire time thinking ""I hate my life.""   I agree with some of the other comments that the sales-pitchy type speech about the restaurant and specials made me wonder whether they understood I had already come in the door and sat down to eat.  The staff stands around in little cohorts in pockets and corners of the restaurant, staring at you like a pack of lions waiting to pounce if your water should run dry or god forbid you put your fork down for a minute.  That being said despite the awkwardness of feeling like you are a judge on Iron Chef being watched every minute of your meal I would probably go back because the food was that good.  I may give it a try for lunch sometime because maybe it would be a less-formal and less-attentive atmosphere.",3,1/2/2010,Atlantic Fish
163,"Before coming to Atlantic Fish Company, I had never been a fan of crab cakes. Seafood is my weakness, but crab cakes were usually a no go. Atlantic Fish changed that. The crab cakes on Atlantic Fish's menu are nothing short of divine. I have had the pleasure of tasting many other items on Atlantic Fish's menu and I can honestly say that crab cakes aren't even remotely the only great thing to order.As for the rest of Atlantic Fish Company, the ambiance, the service, the drinks; all fall well above average.I can heartily recommend Atlantic Fish to any of my friends.",4,1/3/2010,Atlantic Fish
164,Goodbye Legal. It was nice knowing ya.AFC is my new go to spot for seafood. We had 20 oysters. They were so yummy and fresh. And they had ones calle meneshma (?) from the cape that apparently was Mr. Obama's favorite when he visited. I had the cioppino. It was good. Tons of fish and shellfish and a whole half of a lobster. Yummy.... but the show stopper... my boyfriend had a crab crusted filet. O ... M ... G!!! It was out of this world. I don't like filets much but I kept stealing bites.

166,"Wow...thus far, this is my favorite seafood restaurant in Boston.  I grew up in the city and walked by this spot hundreds of times when I was in school (but then again, i was too poor to eat there so I had to get my fill at the Prudential Food Court) but I'm glad to have found it now.Their chowder (both the clam and the seabass) are unbelievably good.  The clam chowder honestly puts Legal's to shame and I'll never be able to look at her the same way.  It's hearty, chunky, with the right amount of salt and creaminess.  Just pure goodness.  I had the chilean sea bass which was buttery and light.  Cooked perfectly.  Fresh seafood, great location and the waitstaff was pleasant.  I've found the best chowder in Boston and don't believe those chowder fest winners...this makes Ned Devine's (2009 winner's) chowder taste like hot garbage (not that I would know what that tastes like)",5,1/19/2010,Atlantic Fish

We were going to try to see Obama stump for ""Coaks"" at Northeastern, so we decided to keep things simple and in the neighborhood. Atlantic Fish seemed to be the best option.I actually hadn't dined here since before the fire, but things seem the same - tasty and dependable. There's nothing earth shattering about the menu, the decor, or the service, but everything is well executed and I have never had a bad experience. I really love the lobster ravioli and the fried oysters, as well as the crab cakes, which are made with very little filler (for example, bread crumbs and mayo). The raw bar is pretty tasty too.This is basically where I take people from out of town for ""Boston seafood"", since I am still pissed at B&G based on my last couple of experiences.",4,1/19/2010,Atlantic Fish
168,"First time in Boston and I must say that the seafood were was excellent! Clam chowder was better than that at the Quincy Market,  the lobster ravioli melted in my mouth, crab cakes were to die for and of course my favorite was the Captain's Platter simply because of two major factors. 1. Fresh seafood and 2.  fried!  I highly recommend dining here",4,1/20/2010,Atlantic Fish
169,"A special ""Thank you"" shout out goes out to you Bostonian Yelpers for putting this place on my radar! It was literally a stone's throw away from The Lenox where I was staying... and wow. Good stuff here people, good stuff. First off, it's a bit booghzie for my taste. Some of the best seafood I've had was typically at ghetto shanky places by the shore where you drink good 'ol pitchers of beer and eat crustaceans with your hands. But man, I was sold from the START at this place. Aside from the posh ambiance of nice linens and ""beck and call' service, the bread they give you is SO warm, soft, and full of bleached flour that's hot damn delicious when loaded with butter. I couldn't get enough. Then, comes the oysters. Wow. I am not afraid to say... them oysters were some of the best I've had. Fresh, no sandy guts, and did I mention fresh? I'm so glad my husband isn't an oyster fan (more for me!)... next was the clam chowder. DEE-licious to the vicious! I hate how some clam chowders are like basic potato stew with semi-artificial clam flavor. Heck no that won't go here! It really was the right amount of creaminess and saltiness. The clams were fresh and totally hit the spot. Lobster anyone? You can totally taste the difference between a Bostonian lobster from this place and say.... a lobster from a Chinese seafood house that's been sitting in ""death row"" tank for god knows HOW long. It's more expensive for less meat, but I tell ya. It's worth the extra bones. Top all that goodness with a bottle of wine and yeah... you may as well do some damage to your dinner budget because it's totally worth it here. The service was outstanding and overall great eats. Even a ghetto girl like me needs to bring out the inner ""high maintenance"" appetite once in awhile....",4,1/21/2010,Atlantic Fish
170,"So it was one of those days again...Jen and I had stayed up well into the night drinking half the champagne in Boston and watching a movie about a gay Mormon while trying to get the Bad Romance dance down. Just paving the way for me to wake up hungover and craving brunch again.... The original plan had been to go to Petit Robert, but we switched to a place that was literally two steps from the apartment, Atlantic Fish, so that I would be able to not fall over and fall asleep hugging a fire hydrant in public. Apparently this was her go-to place when she and/or her boyfriend are feeling the effects of a wild night, and this was no exception. It also helped that Jen rated this at least the second-best place in town to get seafood, which is all I really want when I'm in Boston. I wasn't so much seated, as I sort of ""fell"" into a booth, and we ordered a brown bag of fried oysters. We polished those off and promptly ordered another bag. I love how they're hot and crispy on the outside, and kind of raw and flavorful on the inside. I still needed clam chowder packed with oyster crackers to survive though. It was divine. So I was over the hump and ready for the main course. If you've read the previous installments of my Boston dining saga, it should come as no surprise I ordered the Maine lobster, asparagus, and goat cheese omelet. If it's lobster, or cheese, you can bet that's where I'll go. Jen opted for the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake melt. I really want to emphasize that I'm not overstating things when I say that the omelet was the best I've had. The huge chunks of lobster were awesome; I can only say that it could have used a bit more goat cheese, but not a big deal. These home fries were much better than Masa! Jen commented that hers was delicious (I can't recall if she'd had it before or not), but suffice to say she was again pleased with the place. There were so many things on the menu that looked appetizing; this will have to be the first place we go next time I visit!So it may have been a change of plans, but it ended up being the best seafood experience I've ever had! (Sorry, Truluck's, not even close...)Speaking of change of plans, once I was fueled up at Atlantic Fish, I was put in a cab and whisked off to Northeastern University to check out the madness that was the special Senate election (that I heard about on Yelp!), and hopefully I would catch a glimpse of President Obama...",4,1/28/2010,Atlantic Fish

Service was very professional.",3,2/7/2010,Atlantic Fish

175,"When locals play tourist for the weekend with visiting family, we land here. With no reservations for lunch, the lovely hostess quickly found us a table where we could all spread out. Our waitress was Oscar worthy. In fact, she was so fantastic that I will use her as an example for all future wait staff relationships. She was entirely professional and anticipated every move. She was not overly friendly, nor was she off on some unknown social trajectory when we really needed her. We got a dozen oysters to split which were all a bit pricey at 2.50 each but beautifully presented. (Sadly, another member of the wait staff served one half dozen and reached across the table with this large heavy plate to hand them to the recipient, who struggled with this weighty hand off - the only blip.) The bread basket gets lots of acclaim- crackers, bread and sweet little muffins. We did ask for olive oil for those of us who don't eat the rich creamy butter. As we were able to order from the brunch menu, being a weekend,  Miss Fish Hater got Eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon. The rest of us dove into mussels, scallops, salmon, lobster...all were really amazingly good, although my salmon was slightly overcooked for my taste.You will not leave with an appetite. We had no room for dessert. I never would have come here without my visiting family members. And I am glad I did. It's got a formal, slightly starchy vibe and you pay for that but when the folks are in town, just live it up a bit. After all, they may be tourists but they are still members of the family. Better here than Durgin Park when you do the tourist thing.",4,2/16/2010,Atlantic Fish
176,"I would technically say it's a 3.5 stars.  It wasn't the best but still good.  I would still recommend this restaurant.  We went without reservation and sat at the bar.  The bartender was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.  He gave some great suggestions for the entrees and pairing with wine.  The cup of clam chowder was good with lots of chunks.  I'm not sure if it's award winning.  I can still remember my first time trying Legal seafood's clam chowder and that was a wow.  I'm not sure if I can say the same thing. As for entree, I ordered Seabass with lobster ravioli as recommended.  It was delicious.  It had a light crust on the seabass and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The only thing that bothered me with the fish was that it was a tad bit salty.  The ravioli was good and on the side, but I think it would be better if the ravioli pasta was a little thinner.  I couldn't really taste the filling as well.  The fish came on top of a bed of saute spinach.  Friend ordered the crab crusted haddock.  Fish was cooked perfectly as well.  As for why just 3.5 stars and 4? I guess there's really nothing that stands out that says WOW.  It's what I expected from a restaurant of its kind.  So it's good.  I would want to go back and try their oysters though.  They look pretty good.",4,2/16/2010,Atlantic Fish
177,"The Atlantic Fish Company is a beautiful restaurant.  Although pricey, the quality of the food is exceptional.  This restaurant creates simple dishes that are delicious without being too fancy and complicated.  For starters, we had a cup of the crab bisque which was creamy and full of tender pieces of fresh crab meat.  For entrees, my wife had the cod (baked with breadcrumbs) with spinach and potatoes.  She was very pleased with the freshness and preparation of the fish.  I had one of the specials-steelhead trout with grilled asparagus and lobster mashed-potatoes.  That's right, lobster mashed potatoes.  Just imagine the tastiest, fluffiest mashed potatoes every combined with succulent pieces of lobster meat.  Yes, it was that good.  For dessert we had another special, a homemade vanilla creme-brulee which was fantastic. Our server was OUTSTANDING and we really enjoyed her friendly personality and helpful service.  This was our first visit to Atlantic Fish Company and we hope to visit again in the future.  Because it is kind of pricey, it is the kind of place to visit for special occasions, hopefully we'll have some more special occasions soon!",5,2/20/2010,Atlantic Fish
178,One of my favorite spots in Boston. Service at Atlantic Fish Company is excellent. Great soup selections: can't go wrong with either clam chowder or the real crab bisque. Fishes are fresh. I don't think it's too pricey - $35 per entree including surf and turf. Wine selection can be improved a bit.

179,"I ate here for the first time on Saturday, Feb 20.  Our waitress was excellent - totally on top of things.  The only thing is - the food was really lack luster.  I ordered the Seafood Ciopinio with a saffron broth - BORING!  No flavor, and all the shell fish in the stew was over cooked and tough.  My husband ordered the lobster special which the waitress raved about.  It was described as having been removed from the shell and cooked with a cream sauce then placed back in the shell and baked.  What they did not tell you is they do not deshell the claws so they were still in the shell and completely over cooked.  Too tough to eat and the dish was not served with additional drawn butter for the claws.  The meal was expensive and could have been so much more.  I don't think we will be going back to this joint anytime soon.",2,2/23/2010,Atlantic Fish
180,"Everyone loves to sit outside but on a dreary Saturday afternoon, I much prefer sitting at the bar at AFC. I am actually only here becuz my wife is way-to-easily drawn to any decent seafood joint, and me the good husband prefers to accomodate rather than argue with her as I will ultimately loose. Anyways, my beliefe is that bar dining is generally the unique experience... you tend to strike up conversation with other patrons, the tenders... so much more low key and enjoyable. This bar could be longer but it is a very social one. Bartenders here are personable, skilled and I like gettin' a birds eye view into the pours going into drinks like the Bloody'Ms.... In fact, if their Marys had been stronger I might feel compelled to add a fifth star. O well.Food = Damn good... always has been good here though so no shock.",4,2/24/2010,Atlantic Fish
181,"Unfortunatley, we only stayed one night in Boston. But the city seemed great with all these nice restaurants and beautiful brick houses... We've to come back next time we're in New England!We absolutely wanted to try some seafood of course, especially lobster. So we went to ""Atantic Fish"", cause our cousin went there and was quite pleased. As we were...The waitress was a bit too kind for us (she even gave us a wine ""taster"" before we choose our wine!) but the atmosphere was great, as the decor. Quite old-fashioned and comfy...The cuisine was OK. We loved the strange mixture of crab, cheese and artichoke, served with bread and raw vegetables and the crabcakes. But the lobster was just fine... The New England clam bake isn't a high cuisine preparation and this dish was not enough tasty, it's just a combination of many ingredients put together on a plate. But it's the just the traditional way to eat seafood in New England...Good food, good wine, nice atmosphere, ""The Atlantic Fish"" was perfect for a good night in Boston.",3,2/24/2010,Atlantic Fish
182,"Another restaurant I'm in love with. I live the atmosphere. I love the service and I especially love the food. Actually one thing in particular. I'm mad for scallops. I think, when prepared correctly, that they are a perfect food. Sweet, tender, healthy. I don't like fancy preperations. You can have them cooked so many ways here. I stick to the tried and true pan seared method. Never disappoints! Get it with green beans and the biggest baked potato this side of the fancy steak houses. The portion of scallops is perfect. Huge, juicy, sweet and tender. Most places wish they did scallops this well. Finish it off with the chocolate cake. It's so rich and decadent. After the healthy meal it all gets balanced out. At least that's what I tell myself. I'm sure there are lots and lots if other wonderful things on the menu. I've seen them roll by on the old fashioned food cart they use to deliver food. It all looks and smells wonderful. But why rock the boat. I've found the dish I love. That's my story anyway and I'm sticking to it.",4,3/3/2010,Atlantic Fish
183,"Some of the best seafood I've ever had. It is expensive, but you pay for what you get. The service was perfect and everything was prepared very fast.",5,3/6/2010,Atlantic Fish
184,"I just ate here last night for my birthday. After a long day at work and a series of delays getting there, I was able sit down and eat with my family.The food was pretty good especially the dessert (bread pudding), but it was the service that made this night memorable. Our server (the ticket said Brendan) was a cook for a year here before working the floor. He was more attentive than any server I have had in long time. My parents and sister also really enjoyed their meals and the service. The service alone will have me coming back for what I hope is an equally enjoyable experience.",4,3/18/2010,Atlantic Fish
185,"Very fresh seafood.  My husband and I came here for lunch and Jessica was our server.  She was very sweet and attentive.  We loved the bread, not the sesame crackers - the bread.  It was crunchy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside.  Yummy.  Husband had the fresh sea bass with green beans and potatoes, I had the crab cake sandwich with sweet potato fries, and we shared grilled calamari.  Everything was pretty good, not great, and as I mentioned above, very fresh.",3,3/19/2010,Atlantic Fish
186,"I had my doubts about Atlantic Fish Company but I am definitely a fan. I went here for RW2010 lunch with my girlfriend and we had such a great time.  We were seated immediately (granted it wasn't that crowded at lunch time). My girlfriend had the tuna chili for her starter and I had the fish stew. Both were excellent.  We also both ordered the seared salmon.  While my stomach was telling me that I was full, i could not stop. It was delicious.  I will definitely come back here!",4,3/19/2010,Atlantic Fish
187,"I feel like the food is not up to the standards of what they charge.  My $32 Halibut was dry and overcooked (my fault for not sending it back), the green beans were undercooked.  The fries were great, but it may have been the worst presentation I have ever seen (a big, grease soaked paper bag plopped next to my fish). The service, atmosphere was good and the appetizers were really good.   The place looks great and the bar is big.  Maybe a better place to have drinks and apps rather than a whole meal.  Like Papa Razzi, another restaurant in this company, I feel like they put too much energy into the look and scene rather than the food.  Pretty average stuff for their prices.",2,3/21/2010,Atlantic Fish
188,"Spent the weekend in Boston and picked 3 places to eat -- this was my favorite.  The service was excellent -- my server was very knowledgable about seafood choices and wines.  He made some great recommendations.I had the grilled swordfish, with crushed new potatoes and grilled asparagus.  Simple but delicious.  Chocolate cake dessert was rich and delicious, and I also tasted the peanut butter ice cream pie which had the most amazing peanut flavor.If I come back to Boston, this will be my first stop for a great meal.",5,3/22/2010,Atlantic Fish
189,"When the cat is away, the mice will play.  But when the parents are in town, it's time to chow down!My parents took me to Atlantic Fish this afternoon for brunch, and we all came away raving about it.  Everything, from the service to the food, was well executed.  FOOD:First, you should know that the portions here are reasonably large.  And you get a plentiful bread basket, with amazingly soft and warm sourdough bread, sesame flatbread crackers, and little muffins.  So I would caution against ordering too much.We started with the lobster ravioli with shiitake mushrooms in a basil cream sauce as an appetizer.  The shiitake mushrooms and the cream sauce really made this dish by upping the flavor profile.  The lobster ravioli was good -- light on the ricotta cheese and good firmness to the pasta dough.  I would have appreciated a bit more lobster in there, but that might have been asking too much. I ordered the pan-seared sea scallops over linguine pasta in a basil pesto with artichoke hearts and pico de gallo.  The sea scallops were well seasoned, though a bit stiffer texture-wise than I expected.  The basil pesto looked strong but fell a little flat; the artichoke hearts were a great touch.  I got to try my sister's jumbo lump crab cake melt with brie cheese and basil pesto.  Again, the pesto was a bit muted, but the brie brought the sandwich together, as it never fails to do in these kinds of things.   The lumps of crab were terrific, though the bread was dull and not really worth its calories.  The sweet potato fries were perfectly salted and crispy. My dad got the seafood fra diavolo.  I only got to try some of the lobster chunks in this dish, but they were wonderful.  Fresh, and with a spicy kick.  This dish was finished in its entirety.  My mom ordered the eggs benedict with crab cake.   I didn't get to try this, but my mom raved about it from start to finish, so I suspect it couldn't have been too bad :).   SERVICE:Our waitress was amazing -- clear, attentive, and accommodating.  For example, my mom asked to substitute the home fries that came with her eggs benedict with mixed greens, and the waitress was more than happy to make the change (gotta at least pretend to eat healthier ...).  The food was brought to the table surprisingly fast given how busy the restaurant seemed.   There was even a man (could have been the front end manager) who walked around the main thoroughfares repeatedly to sweep up errant food particles.  They run a tight ship.   To sum up:  I would go here again, for the dishes that feature animals with claws.  Service was amazing, and so was the bread basket.",4,3/27/2010,Atlantic Fish
190,"Came in from Calgary, AB for a bachelor party. Came here based on the reviews.Food - B+ - A+I do not recommend the Sea Bass like many others. It is very good, but the other things we ordered were better. ie: Lobster Thermidor , Clam Chowder, Oysters, and the basket of clams/muscles  for 2 are all A+. Sea Bass was a little bland but still very good.Service - A+There is very few restaurants with the service this one has. Our waiter (con't remember name but has a wife from Nova Scotia) was the best.  He gave some of the best service I have ever received. The groom needed Tums, and one of the girls there ran down to the corner store to get him some. Seriously!Ambiance - A+Fancy but not stuffy, just the right level of noise. Come here to feel comfortable on a date, or with friends. It is classy though, so you feel good being there.Bottom Line: A+ Top shelf all the way. Thank you so much for letting us Canadians come in and have a good time at your phenomenal restaurant. Your staff and food should be the envy of Boston.Thank you!The eight guys in red golf shirts last Saturday.",5,3/29/2010,Atlantic Fish
191,"A good friend of mine and I have regular dinners to catch up, as well as share our love of delicious food.  He chose this place and although I did not love it the first time, I though I'd give it another chance due to all the rave reviews.We started with drinks (I had sangria - pretty yummy and huge) and the seared Ahi tuna.  I just don't like tuna as much as I like salmon and this one was no different.  I ordered the cioppino because that is one of my favorite dishes and he had the lobster fra diavolo.  My cioppino was ehhhh - not as flavorful as I would have expected but everything seemed to be cooked alright.  I think I was still hungry afterwards though.  I tasted my friend's dish, which was much better and had diner's remorse.  Our server was not attentive and I distinctly remember waiting for her multiple times.  I just expected more out of this place and it has disappointed me both times.  Never again, Atlantic Fish...I'd rather go to Oceanaire or Legal's.",2,3/30/2010,Atlantic Fish
192,"I've been to Legal's. I like Legal's.Atlantic Fish Co. is better. It's that simple.My first trip to Atlantic Fish Co. was with a large group (7 people), some of whom are used to catching their own fish (raising the bar for what consititutes ""fresh seafood""), and all of whom eat a significant quantity of seafood (budget permitting). Most of us had also been to Legal's a couple of days earlier, so that experience was fresh in our minds.If there was a competition, it was over by appetizers. There's a lot of good clam chowder in Boston, but I'd put Atlantic's up against anyone's. The raw bar was also excellent... basically, everything was tasty. Service was prompt and thoughtful. The only negative was that the restaurant was out of catfish, which is a relatively minor issue considering the variety of fresh fish options Atlantic had on hand.How good is this restaurant? In a city full of quality seafood restaurants, many of which we'd yet to frequent... we went back to Atlantic Fish Co. three days later.Give me catfish and I'll give you a fifth star.",4,4/1/2010,Atlantic Fish
193,"Atlantic Fish Co was the first nice restaurant I went to for my summer in Boston and I was floored by how amazing the cuisine was in the Back Bay. I ordered the crab cakes and my dad ordered the sea bass. My dad is from maryland and I have had crab cakes my whole life and these are BY FAR THE BEST CRAB CAKES IVE EVER HAD. my dads sea bass was succulent and delicious and i was amazed by how big the portions were. our waiter was incredibly knowledgable and friendly and although the restaurant was nice...everyone was still nice and not stuck up at all. i loved this restaurant so much that i went here for my last night in boston when my mom flew out from orange county, ca so i could show her how wonderful it was. absolutely recommended.",5,4/2/2010,Atlantic Fish
194,"Today was my first day in Boston, and Atlantic Fish was a great start! The staff there was VERY friendly and nice. We got everything we asked for very quickly.For starter, we had their New England clam chowder in a bread bowl, it was chunky (I hate watery clam chowders) and loaded with FRESH clams (that you can taste) and the bread tasted like it was just baked and served to us.For entree, me and my partner in crime shared Pan-seared Sea Bass over spinach and lobster ravioli, and they even split the dish for us. This dish was VERY satisfying after being hungry for hours. The Sea Bass was crispy on the outside, the best part was the lobster ravioli, it was the best way I've ever had lobster (I'm not a big lobster fan, until now). I also had a little bit of Lobster Fra Diavolo, and it was like a spicy version of spaghetti, but the second best spaghetti I've ever had.Atlantic Fish lost a star from me for not squeezing us in, since they only were accepting reservations at the time (and it wasn't busy). We saw open tables outside and asked to be seated there, and they agreed to let us stay. My friend also found a piece of hair on her sea bass, and the waitress tried to tell her that it was part of the fish. But, they ended up taking it back and giving her bigger piece of sea bass.",4,4/2/2010,Atlantic Fish
195,"On a trip to Boston with my sisters, we started our vacation off with our first meal at Atlantic Fish Company. We wanted some raw oysters and we got so much more!Once we got there, we learned that Atlantic Fish Co is a ""scratch kitchen"", so everything was made from scratch. Because we got shared oysters, the only thing we got that was prepared from scratch was the complimentary bread...even that was delicious!",4,4/4/2010,Atlantic Fish
196,"Still my favorite seafood place in town, even though we had not so great service for today's Easter brunch. Missed app order, had to ask for water, dropped food at wrong places, then at wrong table. The server did not have his act together. I hope it was a blip, service has always been great before. Best large belly fried clams ever - beats those North Shore places folks argue about. Looking forward to upgrading this review to five stars",4,4/5/2010,Atlantic Fish
197,"My parents and I had a fantastic time at Atlantic Fish Co this weekend!  With the mid-afternoon temps peaking at 75 degrees, we opted to wait an extra 30 min for a table on the patio and we parked it there for 2 hours once we secured this prime restaurant-real-estate on Boylston.  Our server was Joel and he was phenomenal.  Despite it being super busy, he was very friendly, funny and, most importantly, so helpful by offering suggestions and answering all of our questions.  We started with the fried clams and they were perfect.  (I won't go into details here because I know other reviewers have already raved enough, but I definitely had a religious experience with the bread basket)  For my entree, I had the seafood medley salad which was enormous and brimming with grilled seafood (different kinds of fish, scallops, shrimp).  Some people may find such a random assortment of seafood unappealing, but I personally loved the surprise in each and every bite.  My dad got the pan-seared sea bass and was reluctant to share because he enjoyed it so much.  And my mom had the linguine fra diavolo with mussels, scallops, shrimp and swordfish.  This dish may be served at a lot of restaurants but the tomato sauce that they serve at Atlantic Fish had a great spicy kick to it and that was much appreciated at this table!  Even though we were stuffed to the brim, we finished the meal with blackberry cobbler a la mode and that was also delicious.  All in all, we shared a great patio meal on a beautiful day and needless to say I did not need to eat anything else that day!",5,4/5/2010,Atlantic Fish
198,"what a fabulous dinner date we had here!  i always have fun ordering seafood - oysters on the half shell, crab legs - it's such festive food!hubby and i came here for a late night dinner.  service couldn't have been better.  i'm not a fan of the smooth jazz they play but other than that i have nothing bad to say about the scene.  we loved the oysters, could have used more crab legs but what we got was delicious.  i do wish they served drawn butter automatically with crab, but i get it - it's cocktail crab.  calamari was great, chowdah was the best i think i've had....big pieces of clam.  highlight of the meal was the sea bass with lobster ravioli!!  i'm not sure i like their spinach - i prefer sauteed baby spinach, but mixed with the pasta/creamy tomato sauce on the ravioli...i mean you could put that sauce on dirt and it would taste good.  sea bass was perfectly cooked and ravioli was amazing.  i'm sure we will be back.",4,4/19/2010,Atlantic Fish
199,"Wow, what a wonderful dining experience. I dined at this restaurant two different times on a long weekend trip in Boston. The menu offered a wide variety of the freshest seafood ingredients with a choice of different preparations.  I stared with perhaps one of the best Caesar Salads that I have ever had. I enjoyed a selection of raw oysters followed by a rich and wonderful lobster ravioli. The desert menu really completes the meal. The peanut butter cup ice cream pie is worth stepping foot inside the restaurant alone. Trust me it will leave you wanting more.Overall, an excellent dining experience. The only negatives would be the noise level and lack of chair space because of how close together the tables are placed. Take a seat and enjoy great seafood in the heart of Boston.",5,5/1/2010,Atlantic Fish
