0,Great new spot and great location! Food is delicious! Everyone is super friendly. Can't wait to try more of the menu and the brunch on the weekends!,5,8/28/2019,Stillwater
1,"Stillwater is now at the top of the list for our regular rotation of great places in the city!!!We went with a crew of 10 on their 2nd day, and there were none of the 'new restaurant, still working out the kinks' incidents that we've all seen / heard about.Food was phenomenal, but what else would you expect from Chef Sarah Wade?! Our table (of primarily Southern transplants) enjoyed several rounds of Kick-Ass Cocktails, a few appetizers, and a variety of entrees - everyone couldn't get enough of everything we ordered! The biscuits and butter...no words. Empanaditas were as delicious as you'd expect, and the Everything Bagel Popcorn was spot-on! We had several orders of the Smoked Pork Mac & Cheese, the Ritz Chicken, Butter Toasted Gnudi, and Chicken Fried Ribeye for our entrees. All were delicious, and we ended up going 'family style' because it was all too good not to share! Whether the chicken or the steak, it basically melts in your mouth as you are nearly comatose from the deliciousness...Rounding out the night with the Jelly Donut Creme Brulee was the best move we made all night! They seem to have a great team with Sarah running the kitchen, John running the dining room, and Patty running the bar. We were very fortunate to get to interact with all 3 of these key players, and they couldn't have made it a better all-around experience for my wife's birthday!",5,8/30/2019,Stillwater
2,"Great new place! Been there twice for dinner since they've opened - lamb chops were excellent, so were the biscuits. We were seated immediately both times, and had great service throughout the experience.Fantastic restaurant - can't wait to try their brunch menu!",5,9/1/2019,Stillwater
3,"This is where Townsman used to be. Same decor and layout, but even better food in my opinion. Thoughtful and tasty vegan options, excellent drink selection, and better prices. I hope they are here to stay!",5,9/1/2019,Stillwater
4,"Let's start with the positive - food was excellent.  Not in a nuanced, pinky finger off the glass kind of way, but in the kind of way where we finished everything on the table and fought for bites.  The ricotta dumplings with chanterelles was the highlight of the meal, just a really well composed dish.  And it's a dish I'm still thinking about a few days later ... which is usually a sign that they nailed it.  The wings needed a bit more sauce in my opinion, but we ate them all, and they were smoky and wonderful.  The chicken chili was deeply satisfying.  On top of all of this, the pricing is insanely reasonable (which Townsman was on the opposite end of the spectrum from - perhaps why it failed).  The ricotta dumplings with chanterelles was $18 ... cheaper than most burgers in the city.  I also don't know about the location and the food together; just seems like a high rent space for comfort food - but who am I to judge, I hope they are successful.I am giving Stillwater a full pass on service considering they just opened.  But our server forgot our order, came back to confirm it - then forgot to put in two additional items.  Listen, I cannot hold it against Stillwater for not being a smooth running machine 3 days after opening.  I'll come back in a few months to see if things have picked up here.",5,9/2/2019,Stillwater
5,"Great food, love the menu and the service is outstanding. We've already come back twice",5,9/7/2019,Stillwater
6,"Best new spot in the city. They have something for everyone, including GF and vegetarian and vegan options. I've come for dinner, drinks, lunch, and it was all delicious. Service is attentive and quick. I haven't tried the brown bag option yet but heard good things. I'll be back soon!",5,9/11/2019,Stillwater
7,"Stillwater has instantly become our new go to neighborhood spot! I've been for lunch, dinner, and drinks multiple times and keep coming back. Great food, awesome selection of local beers and cocktails, and excellent service. Can't wait to take advantage of the patio before the weather turns (and brunch when it starts!).",5,9/11/2019,Stillwater
8,Relaxed and charming atmosphere! Everything was delicious. Make sure you get the fried Ritz chicken!,5,9/12/2019,Stillwater
9,Great food and service. I came in for early lunch on a weekend and very much enjoyed their bologna sandwich on Texas toast with creamy egg in the middle. I loved they used thick cut Asian style toast from local bakery as it gives it more substance and taste. And my server Angela was great with both recommendations and friendliness.,4,9/14/2019,Stillwater
10,"Advertised as comfort and cocktails, when we tried to order a cocktail they told us actually they were out of basil and mint.  Then both cocktails we got were undrinkable.   Not  balanced and very unenjoyable.   We got deviled eggs which were a step above the cocktails but the egg white was a bit  watery. Perhaps other food would have changed my review.",1,9/14/2019,Stillwater
11,"Oof! I am in awe! My friend and I met up for dinner at Stillwater tonight. We didn't grab any drinks (but next time I will). Instead, we ordered three entrees to share!! All were reasonably priced and well-portioned. The dishes:Smoked Pork Mac & Cheese: THE STAR OF THE SHOW! Delicious rich and cheesy with a glob of tender pork on top. Get a salad to cut through the richness. Speaking of salad, THE COBB. It's hard to mess up a Cobb, and Stillwater did it well. Finally, we also got the Flat Patty burger with fries. YUMMY! It was such a classic burger, and it did not disappoint. Our server, Angela, was an angel! She was so funny and very helpful and accommodating. Mwah. I will be back.",5,9/14/2019,Stillwater
12,"This place is fine. The food didn't blow my mind, but for comfort food; it does a decent job. For the food; we got the biscuits & butter, buffalo wings, and ritz chicken.The biscuits & butter was solid. Really crumbly and the chicken drippings butter tasted like gravy, it was a good way to start off the meal. The buffalo wings were okay, it needed wayyy more sauce on it though. But the wings itself had a nice smoky taste to it.The ritz Chicken was cooked really well, but insanely bland. Thankfully there's salt & pepper on the table. I had to throw on a decent amount of salt to be able to get a good taste. The portion size for the chicken was generous though. Not sure if I would come back... but there's a lot of potential here.",3,9/15/2019,Stillwater
13,"It's my first time in Boston for me. I just find the place for waiting my friend to pick me up from Mansfeild . I found stillwater. I love it , it seem like the first impression, sit outside, good weather, drinking a couple glasses of wine and good food. Especially my waitress ""Angela"" sorry if i spell her name wrong . She is an Asian girl. So touch it her mind service.",5,9/21/2019,Stillwater
14,"As a native Oklahoman with deep South roots, I am immediately suspicious of any ""southern"" restaurant in the North. However, when I saw that the restaurant was named for an Oklahoman city and read the founder's story, I knew I had to drop in.Came here with a colleague for lunch. Here's the rundown:-Biscuits: These are bougie blue cheese thyme biscuits, which while not traditional, are really nice. The whipped chicken drippings butter is the bomb.-Chicken wings: We ordered the honey mustard butter wings. They were nice and crispy, just right! They were kind of boney, though, compared to most wings.-Mac & cheese: Alas, this fell pretty flat for me. I think they also used a pasta smaller than macaroni (which is fine) but this was overall bland. I didn't finish the mac & cheese.-Ritz chicken: Ok, this is a big ol' Oklahoma sized dish. The chicken was fine, and it is the flatter chicken fried steak style chicken FYI. The mashed potatoes were light, fluffy, and delicious. -Iced tea: Skip. I couldn't even doctor this up enough to be remotely sweet.3.5-4 on the whole, rounded to four due to a nice drink selection, good service, and inventive twists on traditional dishes that didn't go all the way into the category of ""Ok this isn't even Southern anymore.""",4,9/25/2019,Stillwater
15,"This space used to be Townsman and I'm happy to see something else took its place. Stillwater is an American comfort food place with a simple menu that has recognizable items that people should be ableto find something they fancy.I started off with the Crispy Smoked Chicken Wings with the Honey mustard butter and I enjoyed these wings very much. I would definitely order them again and probably order 2 of them as a meal because that's how much I like them.The Flat Patty Burger was delicious too. Two griddled patties melted Cabot cheddar, shredded lettuce, and pickles, and served with hand-cut french fries. This is your classic burger. I didn't like the fries much, I felt they were on the burnt side and mushy, but the burger is right on.Last but not least I had to try the Ritz Chicken, which is fried chicken thighs encrusted with Ritz crackers served with whipped potatoes, charred three onion butter and cress. This is down right comfort food. This dish can put you in a food coma. And I love fried chicken!!!Can't wait to come back.",4,9/28/2019,Stillwater
16,"Went here early (7PM) on a Sat night. The restaurant was pretty busy, some families with kids; by the time we left there were several twenty-somethings coming, a good sign!Fantastic meal, had the biscuits, empanaditas, and deviled eggs...all were outstanding. Our group of 4 had the lamb chops, chicken fried ribeye, and butter toasted Gnudi. And a pork Mac & cheese too. For dessert we had the jelly donut creme brûlée and Pavlova. All outstanding food, Chef Sarah Wade has done a great job. Two minor suggestions: 1) signs on the doors as you walk along the street coming from South Station directing you to the main entrance and 2) little less sauce on the lamb chops, kind of masked the lamb. But very minor, will definitely be back. Great bar/wine list too.",5,9/30/2019,Stillwater
17,"This place is easily the best place to go at anytime: post work drinks, weekend hangs- everything is delicious. The drinks are phenomenal and the staff is amazing.",5,10/17/2019,Stillwater
18,"We had an excellent dinner at Stillwater before going to the theatre district for a show. We ordered the shishito peppers as an appetizer- it came with excellent hummus! For dinner, we ordered the pulled pork mac and cheese and the ricotta dumplings. Both were delicious and we will definitely be back!",5,10/18/2019,Stillwater
19,"Yep. My review is drinks only. Old fashioned made the way dad used to make them: The old fashioned way. G&T = delicious. Smart, attentive and great service. I look forward to coming back.",5,10/19/2019,Stillwater
20,Came here with a few friends for some food and drinks. Great atmosphere. The drinks were spot on and they had some vegetarian/ vegan options! Thank you for the wonderful dinner and amazing service!,5,10/21/2019,Stillwater
21,"I went here recently with 15 friends for a birthday and it was a fun night we got a private room the wait staff was amazing. I ordered an ""adios pantalones"" and a ""thank you, next"" both were great! But that's where the fun ends, the food was ok. It was so disappointing, because we were such a large group we were able to try all of the ""sexy snacks"" the only one and, this is out of the whole meal, empanadas. The favors seemed flat and muted. The Ritz chicken was thick and stodgy, the branzino was light but bland. A friend commented having had the chicken fried prime rib that it just seemed like a waste. Even the mussels which I think are hard to mess up, we're good but lacked innovation, and had a a drizzle of mayo and even though I love mayo just annoyed me here.",3,10/24/2019,Stillwater
22,"Went for lunch, get the chicken salad sandwich- it was so good! In and out really quick, decent price. Will try the brown bag lunch next time! Great addition to the area",5,10/24/2019,Stillwater
23,"Easy lunch pickup spot, The Rach is my go to and the house made chips Also great spot for afterwork... good selection of local craft beers and cold tea!",5,10/24/2019,Stillwater
24,"Food is simply not great.  Biscuits were good in terms of texture and I liked the butter.  I do not see the point of adding blue cheese to the biscuit.  It distracts from the good taste of the biscuits.  Cobb salad wasn't great which is unfortunate because they are using good ingredients.  Too much blue cheese in the salad, not enough tomatoes, bacon is too Smokey in flavor, and dressing is too light.  Dressing flavor was completely overpowered by the other flavors .  My husband ordered this dish -- the Pork in the pork Mac and cheese was tasty and the Mac and cheese tasted good.  But personally I  do not like pulled pork piled in top of mac and  cheese.  Empanadas had  potential but fell flat.  Empanadas looked good, crust was good, but the empanadas  didn't taste great.  Service was great.",2,10/27/2019,Stillwater
25,"Overhyped restaurant with very average food. Ambiance, service, and cocktails fantastic (5/5)! Food is 3/5, but let's face it, food is really the main reason we go out to eat. Lots of places can get ambiance & drinks right.Biscuits were good & fresh. PASS on the deviled eggs (no flavor at all, like eating regular hard-boiled eggs). Also pass on the everything bagel popcorn (def not worth $6).I got the filo tart, and it was just alright. Lacking in depth; kinda one-noted in flavor. If you like bland tomato paste, go for it.Someone at the table got ricotta dumplings which were a little too rich. I had one and thought it was quite good, but he said it got harder and harder to eat as they were so heavy. This guy usually eats a ton and didn't finish the dish. He gave it a 3/5.Another friend got the scallops on special, and those were really good!Overall, it was good to check out once, but we will not be back.",3,11/1/2019,Stillwater
26,"Large group (12) had an amazing Sunday brunch, rare that EVERYONE was pleased with their food and service! Started with apps(called Sexy Bites on the menu) of cheddar biscuits with maple butter, breakfast tacos, pancake battered fried sausage bites, and Bloody Marys. Drinks were on the spicier side but waitress was happy to have the bar custom-make a non-spicy version too. Burgers with fried egg topper, blueberry pancakes, biscuits smothered in gravy, plus fried potatoes or tater tots and bacon, start to finish everything was delivered hot and by very helpful waitstaff. We will be back, wonderful experience!",5,11/3/2019,Stillwater
27,"Fantastic food, cocktails & service! Blown away... the chef really has this place taken care of. From the deviled eggs to the burger & chicken sando.... & did I mention the chips & pasta salad?! So happy we stopped in!",5,11/8/2019,Stillwater
28,"It's real nice, real classy without being snobby. Helluva location, great view, chill scene. Nice beer choices, quality cocktail selections, tasty snack options. It is all good!",5,11/9/2019,Stillwater
29,So on a quest for Pavolva I found this place. I was a little hesitant because it has just been featured on Chronicle but we took a chance on a late Sunday lunch. It was delicious. The cosmos we. Had were some of our favorite. Te empanadas were great. As was the ritz chicken and ricotta dumplings. I love deviled eggs and these were creamy but needed spice.  The smoked chicken chili was good but the consistency was a little off putting. The side of fries not so good. The Pavlova was everything we wanted. A blend of tartans sweet. A return is on the horizon.,5,11/10/2019,Stillwater
30,"We loved our dinner at Stillwater! We stopped in before a concert on a Sunday night without a reservation, and they had no problem seating us. We both ordered cocktails and they were delicious, though a little out of season for fall. For dinner, we shared the smoked pork mac & cheese and the cucumber, melon, chili salad. The mac & cheese was fantastic- super creamy with fresh pasta cooked perfectly. It was super rich, so we were glad to have the salad as well. The salad was fresh and nicely dressed. It was a delicious compliment to the mac & cheese. For dessert we went for the PB&J creme brûlée and it was fantastic- creamy, nutty, with a nice tartness from the jam. Service was super quick through the whole meal and we got all our food much faster than anticipated. We were on our way to our concert in no time. I'd highly recommend Stillwater!",5,11/16/2019,Stillwater
31,"My friend and I decided to come here after seeing that this place was ""trending."" There was no wait when we arrived. We got a half-booth and a chair table which seemed pretty cramped. It felt as if we were almost blocking in another couple by surrounding their table.We ordered the yellow mussels and smoked pork mac & cheese to share. The food came out pretty quickly. The pork mac & cheese was a little smaller than I had anticipated, but we were pretty pleased with it. There was a good amount of pulled pork on top - we were both happy about that. The yellow mussels came with some fries on top with a drizzle of delicious aioli. Maybe it's because I haven't had much experience eating mussels, but I didn't think it was anything particularly special. If anything, I enjoyed the French fries with the aioli much more than the mussels. The server was attentive, but it also seemed like she was rushing us out since she came by so often. Overall, my friend and I were stuffed at the end of our dinner. We were both satisfied, but I'm personally not sure I would come back again. It was a good experience, though.",4,11/23/2019,Stillwater
32,"Food was fine.  Drinks were NOT.  What sort of drinks?  The kind that ANY restaurant should get right.  I ordered hot tea that came warm.  After dinner, my companion & I wanted coffee.  She wanted a latte & I wanted a decaf.Our server let us know we couldn't have either.  To be clear, he barked at us...""we don't have an espresso machine""....""we don't have decaf"". No apologies.  Just a terse response to our requests.  We ordered regular coffee.  Big mistake.  It was tepid & bitter. Lovely.",3,11/29/2019,Stillwater
33,"Has become our go-to spot, and consistently delivers. Staff has always been considerate and attentive. The food never misses. Favorites include empenaditos, chicken chili, bronzini, and pulled pork on anything. Allagash White beer on tap. If I had to find a fault, it's this: the button-tufted couches at some of the tables are not as comfortable as other seating: They're too deep, a bit too low. But that's a minor note; overall, a wonderful local restaurant.",5,12/8/2019,Stillwater
34,"I cannot say enough amazing things about Stillwater. Every bite is better than the last; the space is HUGE; the staff was nice and attentive; and the drinks were strong, and cold. The location is great, too; easy to get to from Chinatown and downtown area; just a few blocks from Boston Commons/Public Garden.If you get one chance and one chance only to eat at Stillwater, here's what I'd recommend:Appetizer: Biscuits + Butter and/or Shishito Peppers. (I don't even like bleu cheese and I'm still dreaming of the biscuits...)Meal: RITZ Coated Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes. The oniony butter sauce takes this to the next level.Dessert: PB+J Creme Brulee. I'd go back and just order this dessert alone, it was that good.Other showstoppers: Everything Bagel Popcorn, Smoked Pork Mac and Cheese, and the Pavlova.No doubt one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. Get your reservation in now, because they're booking up quickly.",5,12/9/2019,Stillwater
35,"Excellent food. One of the best I have been to this year, and the drinks were also fabulous. The space is great too.",5,12/11/2019,Stillwater
36,"Very casual.  Noise is a little higher than average.  Parking a little difficult at times.   Other than those items, it's a pretty fun place to have an unpretentious meal at a great price.  Portions are large and the food is creative and well thought out. I love going somewhere that just reading the menu is fun contemplating the descriptions.  We ordered the biscuits, deviled eggs, burger, and bbq pork sandwich; and we each had a glass of house red wine.   Total was about $65.  You would be hard pressed to find a trendy place in the city that a couple could go to wine and dine on good food with great friendly service for about $60!Everything was done above average and memorable.   Not sure I had anything that would draw me back due to craving it, with so many other places I need to try, but I would go back if the opportunity presents itself to sample some of the more complex, higher priced entrees.,I recommend you get reservations, which are easily secured through their website.  We booked our reservation on a Saturday night about 90 minutes before our meal time.And yes, I did say above that they serve deviled eggs.  So smooth and creamy with smoked paprika sprinkled on them, topped with bits of fried chicken skin.  Delicious, and that app was only about $6 to try something you don't see in very many places...except up north at a woodsy holiday meal or at grandma's funeral reception.",4,12/14/2019,Stillwater
37,"Delicious! Came with a group for lunch and they handled us easily, and food was delicious. It's not the healthiest spot around, but no worse than you'd expect going in :)My major frustration, though, was that I ordered a sandwich with 'daily salad'. Perhaps it's my mistake for not clarifying, but it turned out that my day's daily salad was a condiment-sized cup of potato salad. I was expecting greens! Daily salad might mean something different elsewhere, but my meal was not what I expected.",4,12/15/2019,Stillwater
38,We had an amazing waiter! That was absolutely the best part! The food was just okay tho. Not enough on your plate for the price and just didn't have a ton of flavor. Not sure if I'd go back but still had a good night out!,3,12/15/2019,Stillwater
39,"After works drinks and dinner. Close to South Station and downtown crossing. Kingston Street entrance is decked with Christmas trees, ceiling ornaments and lighting. Hostess were pleasant and sat us right away where we preferred away from the bar. The modern style sofas make for a comfortable dinner. Drink and appetizer menu is sassy and fresh. Second night I had a ""take your pants off"" drink. Here at Stillwater it's called "" ADIOS PANTOLONES""  I also enjoyed a wine spritzer with orange peel. Sweet! The creamy deviled eggs with crispy chicken skin was fine, it was missing something.....garlic? paprika?  something. Our entrees were very good. A bit on the salty side but not unbearable. Ritz cracker fried chicken thighs, mussels and gluten free gnocchi, all delish. Been there done that and enjoyed.",3,12/18/2019,Stillwater
40,"This place is out of control. Deliciousness? Out of control. Portion size? Out of control. Niceness of staff? Out of control. Inventive cocktail selection? Out of control. The only thing that wasn't out of control was the pricing :)Everything we tried was excellent. The smoked buffalo chicken wings are some of the best I've had. We couldn't stop eating the pulled pork mac n' cheese. The ritz chicken was fabulous and those mashed potatoes, yeah. The cucumber melon salad was bright and fresh -- it reminded me of a similar Vietnamese or Thai salad. The pomodoro was good, although not quite as good as the other dishes (adding some red pepper flakes made a big difference). We were also fans of the cocktail menu, which had some fun twists.Super convenient walking and T location near South Station, Downtown Crossing, and Chinatown; parking can be a bit tough though. An excellent upgrade from Townsman!",5,12/23/2019,Stillwater
41,On a trip to Boston and this was our first stop. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. Everything we ate was very flavorful and tasty. The ricotta dumplings were so light and fluffy. The ritz cracker chicken was crazy delicious! My husband also enjoyed the cocktails,5,12/27/2019,Stillwater
42,"Stopped in for a quick bite and drink but stayed for the vibe and wings. I can't quite say I've seen enough to give 5 stars, but I definitely will be back. The crispy smoked wings were perfectly cooked with crispy skin on the outside and juicy meat on the in. We were able to enjoy a seat at the bar chowing some wings with a few beers/Prosecco (your choice) and the football games playing in the background. Back drop music was on point varying from dancing queen and bohemian rhapsody to Travis Scott and Post Malone. Overall. Good service. Good apps. And a good vibe.",4,12/28/2019,Stillwater
43,Delicious meal. Very heavy. Great drinks. Fantastic ambiance. Had the opportunity to meet the chef. Overall added to a great experience!,4,12/28/2019,Stillwater
44,"I've been here a few times because the bartenders here are fantastic. There are always new fun drinks to try and locals are friendly.  The food is meh but that okay we come for the service, drinks, and atmosphere. However this time we decided to sit at a table and were served by a young blonde server. She was nice, but not attentive at all. Had empty drinks for 25 minutes waiting for her to return, watching her chit chat with other employees. Debating on coming back but definitely will just go to the bar if we do.",1,12/29/2019,Stillwater
45,Did not grab food here but only the drinks.Drinks were strong and service was attentive. The place is very beautiful and everything was clean. Would highly recommend coming here for drinks and/or romantic dinner.,5,12/30/2019,Stillwater
46,"This was my first visit.  The restaurant was clean, comfortable and attractive.  The location is perfect for dinner before a show at the Opera House, which is just up the street.  I chose this place for the comfort food menu options for a mixed group of diners that included young teens.  The mixed drinks sounded fun but were weak and underwhelming.  Will try again some other time in case it was the good bartender's night off.  Wait staff were friendly and helpful.  The deviled eggs were fine but not great.  The everything bagel popcorn was tasty and a hit with our table.  The biscuits were a flop - too much blue cheese flavor, too dry.  The Ritz Chicken was good enough, but nothing special. The mac and cheese with smoky pulled pork was delicious- creamy and satisfying pasta and flavorful, moist meat.  I had the ricotta dumplings, admittedly an odd choice at this southern style restaurant, but I enjoyed it very much.  The dumplings were light and fresh, and I cleaned the plate chasing the last bit of the cream sauce and vegetables. We passed on dessert but there were some interesting items on the menu.  I would go back to this place if I had tickets to a show.  Not sure I would make a special trip here.  It was fine.  Four stars for decent food, reasonable prices, good location, excellent service and a clean, pleasant atmosphere.",4,12/31/2019,Stillwater
47,"Stopped by late afternoon on a Saturday and was able to sample some good southern eats! Stillwater is a bit tucked away in Chinatown and it's easy to miss; stepping inside, the space feels very open (bathrooms at the front near hosts), to down the hall with the bar, and into the main dining area. We absolutely adored the Ritz chicken; the chicken was definitely tender, perfect, and was simple-chicken-thighs-done-right kind of dish. The mashed potatoes were smooth and deeply satisfying too; while this dish was probably the least visually impressive, it's the one I would 100% order again. We felt a bit let down by the mac and cheese; the pulled pork definitely could've been enhanced a little. A fresh tomato/cheese/onion tart also really helped brighten our table up as well and felt homey and comforting. Stillwater has some stellar plates (ritz chicken for sure!) and service/staff definitely made it a great experience. Would go again.",4,12/31/2019,Stillwater
48,"Great food and cocktails! We ordered the Flat Patty Burger and Ritz Chicken. Both were delicious! The atmosphere was great as well, and so was the service.",5,1/5/2020,Stillwater
49,"We started off with the biscuits and butter, was surprised at getting 3 biscuits for four people, however they fit the bill, they were delicious and everyone at the table felt it to be the perfect amount. Loved the blue cheese as it made a nice addition. Would have liked them to stay together a bit more as the biscuit was crumbly. The everything bagel popcorn was highly addicting considering we had just come from seeing a movie and having popcorn there. Meals were the ritz chicken and the country fried rib eye, interesting that 3 who ordered the chicken are not big fans of thighs but each one said the thighs were great. The chicken was crispy and the meat was moist. Now for the country fried rib eye, need I say more. This was a great twist of country fried steak, the rib eye was cooked perfectly and sat over a bed of mashed potato along with asparagus. So much food that half came home. Our server was great, very friendly and not intrusive. Staff is attentive, if water glasses were low they were filled quickly. The PB creme brulee was an interesting twist and tasty, highly recommend for the peanut butter lover.",4,1/5/2020,Stillwater
50,Solid take on modern pub food. Service was very good. Food was above average. Not the most creative but ticks the box for comfort food.,4,1/12/2020,Stillwater
51,"Great drinks and friendly service. We got the gin blossom, Manhattan and old fashioned. All 3 were great",5,1/12/2020,Stillwater
52,We picked up food the other day and the  food was great!!! My boyfriend had the veggie burger and said it was super yummy. I had the ricotta dumplings and they also hit the spot! I think it would probably be much better if we were to eat at the restaurant but it made for a cozy night in :),4,1/20/2020,Stillwater
53,"Came here for lunch with my friend. Love the vibes of the restaurant and the service was warm and inviting. Unfortunately we weren't in love with the food. They sound more flavorful and exciting on paper then they did when we actually ate them. Seems like a good place for people who like to be adventurous but can't handle a new taste.  To end  on a positive note, one thing I HAVE to give credit for is the PB & J Creme Brûlée for dessert. That was something I would highly recommend.",2,1/23/2020,Stillwater
54,"Went for brunch. Literally don't go here. It's not worth it. The menu sounded good-but there was nothing special about this place or the food. The brunch drinks were bad. When I asked the server what their well tequila was she said ""Tito's"" so...I asked again and she literally said I don't know much about alcohol...it was loud there were babies crying and people yelling over one another. And really my final comment is I really don't know how or why anyone would allow this executive chef to have a restaurant. Stay home scramble an egg or two you'll be a lot happier. Or maybe go anywhere else.",1,1/26/2020,Stillwater
55,"It's pretty rare I post anything on Yelp. Maybe a handful of times over the past several years. I normally save my reviews for restaurants that are exceptional and I just have to go on and rave about it. But every once in a great while. A restaurant is so bad I just can't contain myself. This is one of those stories (cur law and order SVU gavel drop right before show starts)One can only imagine how this place is consistently getting rave reviews. If I had to venture a guess, it would be that it's the only brunch spot in the neighborhood and the decor and food is very ""Instagram-able""As I look around at all the 20 something women in high waisted jeans, crop tops, Burberry coats, messy buns, drinking mimosas, I feel like I walked into the seaport district. The decor has the hipster pop. It looks like I'm in LA visiting some artists studio. And by artist I mean. You tube influencer. Not someone with actual artistic skill. The drinks...actually first we have to talk about the service as that then rolls into the drinks.The server. After casually strolling up to our table 15 minutes after being sat. Gives no greeting. Not even her name or a smile. Asks if we're ready to order. I'm guessing her entire style of being a server is to just wait 15-20mins after everyone is sat. That way she has to interact as little as possible with the guests and just imply takes orders. I've had more pleasant interactions with self order screens. At least they say please, thank you, and can probably answer questions.We asked the server, sorry. She's a waiter. Not a server. We asked the waiter what tequilas they have ""Tito's, grey goose, I'm not sure what else. I don't really drink"" No offer to get us a spirits list. Or check with anyone. Cool. Just whatever your well is, is fine. Ordered our food. It came out promptly. Looked nice. We had the Essex. The biscuits. And the 421. Catagoricaly across the board the food was unseasoned, bland, and just...mediocre at best. Chef Wilde was in the kitchen running the Sunday brunch service which leads me to quite a few questions. One. Has she ever been a chef before or is this her first ship? Two. Did she taste any of the sauces or mise before service or just trust her cooks to run it up proper? And three. If she did taste the sauces, how bad is her palette?421. One of the worst hollandaise sauces I've ever had. Homemade chili oil? What chili did you use? It had about as much spice as chili from TLC had. The smoked pork was dry. Eggs were under poached and had no body to them at all. Biscuits. Got enough ""maple bacon butter"" for probably one biscuit...the order comes with three. The biscuits are good. If you've never made biscuits before in your life and have no idea what makes a great biscuit great, then you'll appreciate these fall apart imitations. The maple bacon butter was mediocre at best...honestly...how do you fuck that up? I'm perplexed.The Essex. The omelet came out looking about as dry and Haggard as the Chinatown area of the street it's named after. Whoever was on egg station that day was clearly struggling. I got the don swan brunch cocktail. Not sure if this wasn't made properly, or if the only requirement for a house cocktail here is that it look pretty-ish or have something unique and kitchy about it (Oreo rim) The cocktail was just bad. I was excited when I saw it used Don Papa rum. Something that has become somewhat of a favorite this past year for both is delicious mild flavors and remarkable affordability to quality ratio, but what this drink did to that beautiful rum....a pirate would be made to walk the plank if he dared serve the captain this. The only reason this place even gets a second star is because the manager (I wrote a note on the back of the credit receipt explaining the service was terrible while still leaving an 18% grat) John....something. I can't remember. At least had the decency to look up the number in my reservation and give me a call to apologize for the poor service and try to invite us back to try them out again. Every Sunday I drive from Newton into Boston or a surrounding area to try a new place for brunch. Last week I went to citrus and salt in back bay and had a great time. This week. I wasted 26minutes of my life driving to Stillwater and another 15 looking for parking before finally coughing up $20 to park in a garage near the place. Final result. Tl;Dr . Avoid this place. Bad good, bad drinks, lousy service. Feel bad for the guy who has to manage this travesty.",2,1/26/2020,Stillwater
56,"Great food and great service. Val was our waitress. She couldn't have been nicer. Very attentive and courteous. We had the biscuits, popcorn, shishito peppers, deviled eggs and a veggie burger that they were nice enough to cut into two halves. Everything was cooked to perfection.",5,1/27/2020,Stillwater
57,"Great place to eat.  Casual dining. Comfort food but with an upscale edge. Convenient to the T (South Station) which can make  it easy to get to if you live outside of Boston. (definitely easier than finding parking)  I've eaten there multiple times and always had a great meal and great service.    I've had several dishes and appetizers (Everything popcorn, shishito peppers, deviled eggs) that were also excellent. My family and I have tried brunch there also and we were not disappointed.  For brunch, the Essex is my choice.  For dessert I chose the PB&J Creme Brulee which really hit the spot. Stillwater has been our go-to place for bringing out of town guests and or local friends. Give it a try.",5,1/29/2020,Stillwater
58,"Stillwater is a very nice restaurant to go to for date night. They have great cocktails if you're looking for some drinks with your meal. I ordered the vegetarian burger. Unfortunately when the food first arrived, I immediately spotted a hair on the bun and sent it back. The waiter was very apologetic and brought out a new one, while also removing it from the bill which was a great surprise when the check arrived. The burger itself was tasty! For my personal preferences, I would have preferred there to be more flavor to the party itself - maybe the patty just needs a few more ingredients? However, my friend got the Kingston bowl and that was absolutely delicious. If I decide to go back, I'll be ordering that bowl.",4,2/1/2020,Stillwater
59,"We had to wait a bit even though we made a reservation. The atmosphere is nice and service was good. The food was just okay. Nothing was bad but nothing stood out either. We ordered the biscuits (solid), popcorn, empanitas, pork Mac n cheese, burger, pork sandwich, bronzini and the ricotta balls. The mac and cheese and burger was good. The others were just okay.",3,2/1/2020,Stillwater
60,"Delightfully elevated! Being a big fan of Chopped, when I heard about Chef Sarah Wade opening up a spot in Boston, it was a must try the next time I was in the area. The interior matches the comfort feel as well. The prices were very reasonable and well worth it. The biscuits are a staple and must have! The empanaditas were the best ones I've ever had, the crust was crispy and cooked perfectly. For the entree, we had the macaroni and cheese with pulled pork which was crusted with ritz crackers. It felt like home, warmth, and we relished every bite. Being intrigued by a PB&J creme brûlée, we went with that for dessert and it didn't disappoint. The peanut butter creme was perfect and the peanut butter brittle was a nice touch. I would recommend this to all groups of people. It's nice enough to feel classy, but laid back enough to be a casual a spot. The only room for improvement that I would recommend is the knowledge and attentiveness of the hostess and waiters/waitresses. They didn't provide much, and our waiter even admitted that he didn't know what some of the cocktails tasted like so he couldn't suggest it or something else.",5,2/2/2020,Stillwater
61,"WOW - everything from service, to drinks and of course food was top notch. We sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen and were so entertained by the chefs. Highly recommend for an indulgent brunch!",5,2/8/2020,Stillwater
62,"I brought my husband here for his birthday dinner on our visit to Boston. They didn't have room for us at the tables or bar, but we sat at the counter and the service was amazing! We were very entertained by the sous chef. Everything we ate from the charcuterie board to the donuts was superb. We will be coming back here for brunch someday. Thanks for a great experience and delicious eats!",5,2/8/2020,Stillwater
63,"This was my very first time visiting Boston, so I had to see what was the local buzz. As my very first taste of Boston, I came here due to the raving reviews and many of the ""Top Places to Eat in Boston"" lists that this place landed on. I had a very hard time deciding what to eat on the menu as everything seemed very appetizing. Even my waitress, who was a Florida implant as well, had a hard time recommending a dish because she loved all of them. The most highly recommended dishes were the burger and the pulled pork mac and cheese. I was not in the mood for a burger since I had to continue to walk around for a few more hours until check in, so I opted for the mac and cheese. I am normally not a fan of Mac because I get tired of the flavor quickly. However,  I am from the South, so most of our mac and cheese that are found in any true Southern style restaurant or at a BBQ, you can bet it's delicious. I took my first bite of this monster and WOW. You wouldn't think their cheese would be different, but WOW. I was IMPRESSED. It was extremely cheesy and not watery. The pork was a little salty, but mixed with the cheese, it was a great combination. I would definitely order it again.",4,2/12/2020,Stillwater
64,"Came to Stillwater with a reservation one evening and was promptly seated at a spacious table (not always a guarantee in this area of Boston). The vibe of the restaurant is awesome overall. The drinks are innovative and really delicious, probably the highlight of the meal. I ordered the veggie burger and the person I was with ordered the spaghetti pomodoro - they were both fine: I wasn't upset we ate them but I'm not sure I'd ask for them again. The pasta just didn't seem very flavorful even with the lemon and tomato, and the burger was good but didn't have a ton of structure to actually feel like a burger. We would come back perhaps for after work drinks or to try a dessert, but not sure we'd prioritize dinner again.",3,2/12/2020,Stillwater
65,"I really liked this place. It was right around the corner from our hotel. The atmosphere is really nice, you walk in and there's a bar and further in there's tables and another bar where you can see the cooks. I ordered the chicken chili which was very tasty and it came with a biscuit,  which was good. My friend ordered the healthy bowl which had lots of different items. She liked it. She also got a beer. Really comfortable atmosphere, nice  crowd, great service, and lots of unique and healthy options and homemade  comfort food.",5,2/14/2020,Stillwater
66,"Stillwater knows what brunchers want: visual plates and drinks that'll bring out your mean girl Gretchen when ordering and consuming. Case in point: there's a rotating menu special called Chefy's Panks that I will eternally roast for name and name alone. (Side note: on our trip, they were Reese's Cup pancakes with the candies, uh, griddled inside and the cakes drizzled with chocolate and sweetened peanut butter syrups. Cool, whatever,)I like their soles pulled pork, and I loved the construction of the 421 (ha, weed humor) - a cast iron amalgamation of poached eggs, spiced potatoes, said pork and some wild west hollandaise I know they made for the menfolk. How can I be so sure? Only one guy at our ten top didn't get it. They're smart, the Stillwater folk are. Cary Mary is a dope, Trumpian spin on the bloody and not for any other reason than it's orange. No tomato, just the carrot juice, along with a house spice blend and a sweet skewer of bacon and pickles. Get an order of the biscuits, too. The rasher bits are palpable. Nothing was bad, although some plates and cocktails fared better than others and our server was very absent. We though to may have been because of the auto tip on a party of six or more, but when we got the check, it wasn't added. So, gain attention however you see fit.Secret street parking along the entrance and a sizable footprint for brunch crowds, add Still water to the short list.",4,2/14/2020,Stillwater
67,"Overwhelmingly surprised by this place.  It's a long and narrow restaurant and bar.  At the entrance, the modern-chic bar is what greets you immediately following the host(ess) station.  Walking through the somewhat crowded bar, you pass stools with a long table overlooking the kitchen staff, into the dining area.  I like how it's set back from the hustle and bustle of the bar area.  I was very pleased that the tables weren't crammed in there atop each other, like many other restaurant/bars in the downtown area.  We were seated at a half-booth table, with plenty of room from our immediate neighbors.  Our waitress came over promptly to share evening specials, and pour water. We started with the biscuits and butter, with baked in blue cheese, as well as the smoked chicken empanaditas.  While $8 for biscuits seems a little pricey, these were worth it.  The biscuits were warm, with tasty blue cheese, and delicious butter.  The empanaditas were good.  For main courses, my wife ordered the pulled pork & slaw sandwich, I ordered the ricotta dumplings with mushrooms.  The sandwich was piled high, both with pork and fries, the meat was perfectly tender & flavorful.  The dumplings were great, almost like gnocchi, but even more soft/plump/tender.  The mushroom & cream sauce was spot on. 10/10 would order this again.  We saw a few desserts in passing, but nothing jumped out at us.  They had a special pre-fix menu that had assorted pastries that looked delectable; we asked our waitress if it was possible to order that, but were told it was only available with the pre-fix menu.  Mixed drink prices were on par for Boston (~$14 each).  We thoroughly enjoyed every dish.  We liked the upscale casual atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  Trying to find the place may be a bit challenging, as it's at the intersection of several one-way streets just on the outskirts of Chinatown, with limited street parking.  But seek them out and enjoy a wonderful meal.",5,2/15/2020,Stillwater
68,"So many ""sexy starters"" to choose from!! The biscuits and butter are to die for though. They're full of flavor and are huge! The empanditas are very good as well just a little pricey. For the entree there is a variety of dishes to choose from such as lamb, chicken, pulled pork, Mac and cheese, and fish. I had the pulled pork Mac and cheese and it was delicious. It was a decent size portion too! I highly recommend visiting this restaurant if you're taking a trip to Boston!",5,2/17/2020,Stillwater
69,"Nice experience, I had steak Pita, it says Blu, as in blue cheese, but it is light on the liquid like dressing, I put my wife horseradish slaw she didn't want on it and it made the sandwich a solid 3.5.Wife had Turkey - Rach- coleslaw on side- she love it, solid 4.3.Easy walk from South station (5 min) would go back.By the way- you pass Tate on the way, another good spot, but I liked Stillwater a bit more better.",3,2/20/2020,Stillwater
70,Very cute brunch spot! The portions were good sized for the price. Lots of cute/tasty options to choose from. Would have liked to see some espresso options for drinks but was very pleased with the food and coffees.,5,2/23/2020,Stillwater
71,"I heard about the Ricotta dumplings so I came for the ricotta dumplings! There were excellent, the sauce was especially great. I also ordered the biscuits to start which were very good. The blue cheese is a little unusual but that's why I ordered them. Since I don't eat chicken, I opted to go sans chicken drippings butter. I'm sure it tastes great, but just not for me. I used the biscuits to soak up the extra sauce from the dumplings...culinary power move.",5,2/25/2020,Stillwater
72,"I came here for brunch while I was in Boston for the day. I sat at the bar and had some pancakes and beer. The atmosphere was great and even though I was reading at the bar, there are TVs to watch games and really good music play. Will definitely be coming back here!",5,3/1/2020,Stillwater
73,"Solid brunch spot located next to Chinatown. My friends and I decided to come because we saw a photo of their biscuits! We made a reservation through resy for Saturday brunch. To start, we ordered the biscuits. The biscuits were cheddar black pepper and came with a side of maple butter. It was a good balance between savory and a little sweet. I ordered the eggs benedict, and they ordered the 421. Eggs benedict was average, and we enjoyed the variety of brunch potatoes that came with it.",4,3/3/2020,Stillwater
74,"I want to like their fare, but when their biscuits taste like they came out of the Red Sea, I have a hard time wanting to explore the menu...wings were ok, same for mac & cheese.",3,3/22/2020,Stillwater
75,"We stumbled across this place since the restaurant we were going to order from was closed. We ordered delivery through the yelp app and the 3 of us each ordered the smoked pulled pork sandwich and one smoked pork Mac & cheese. I'm so glad we decided to order from here. The ordering was seamless and the delivery actually arrived earlier than expected which was great because the food was still hot! I even got updates on my delivery status! The pulled pork sandwich was juicy and very tasty and the bread was amazing. A little soggy on the bottom from sitting in the carton but still really tasty. More than enough food. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because online it says the side is french fries but it was actually chips. The Mac& cheese was so good too! The ritz cracker crumbs added the perfect flavoring to the top and I even saved it for lunch today! As some feedback, it would be really great if we could also order some of the tasty drinks the website mentions as we would have loved to try those as well! Highly recommend this business-you won't be disappointed. It was super tasty and I definitely would order from here again.",4,5/4/2020,Stillwater
76,"I was searching for some really good BBQ in Boston.  Many places are closed due to Covid and BBQ doesn't typically travel well, but Stillwater was open and ready to impress.  The ritz chicken was my favorite.  It was crispy, flavorful and tender - going perfectly with the creamy mashed potatoes.  Comfort food at its best.  The pulled pork sandwich was really impressive.  The pork was smoked to perfection, the slaw and sweet bbq balanced everything out, and the grilled texas toast held it's crispiness in a way I didn't think possible for delivery barbecue.  Lastly, we got a side of Mac and cheese with pulled pork that put our covid-staple Mac and cheese to shame.  Creamy, filling, with the right amount of texture added with the pork and crushed ritz.  Can't wait to try some other things on the menu!",5,5/11/2020,Stillwater
77,"I went their with my friends and Erin our waitress provided excellent service, gave great recommendations and really knew the menu. The food was delicious, even down to the bread!",5,6/18/2020,Stillwater

79,"I found this place online under ""best places in Boston to eat"" and it did not disappoint. Amazing. The chef - a super cool woman in her own right - is from Oklahoma, hence the name of the restaurant. Thus the menu has some nods to that part of the country and it's amazing. I ate there by myself on a business trip and still had a full three courses. It's a must. Oh, and it's in a great location to watch people. It would make an amazing date night. Service was excellent.",5,7/8/2020,Stillwater
80,Pre covid review: lots of drinks and lots of eats were had in celebration of a new job. I think I ended up trying all the drinks and they were all delicious. I had the vegan pork rinds which were bland and the everything popcorn which was just like regular popcorn with too much butter on the side. I also got the ricotta gnocchi which was so creamy and smooth and perfect with the mushrooms and yellow tomatoes. Service was great and she automatically split the bill for us.,4,7/29/2020,Stillwater
81,"I've loved Stillwater before Covid and continue to love it now. Everything here is amazing but if you can get their dumplings they are life changing. I would also recommend anything fish or seafood based. But again I've never ordered anything from appetizers to salads to dinner to dessert that wasn't awesome. Their cocktails are top notch as well.If you are going in covid times, all tables are spaced much more than 6 feet apart. All staff are wearing masks and gloves at all times. I felt very comfortable being there. One of my favorite restaurants and will continue to go back again and again!",5,8/16/2020,Stillwater
82,"Went to Boston to visit my 2 month old granddaughter and her parents. Ordered lunch from Stillwater, one of the few places open for lunch Mondays. The food arrived 2 minutes before the scheduled time. Everything was exactly as ordered and delicious. We had a beet salad, Mac n cheese, a pulled pork sandwich, and a burger. The lunch helped make for a great visit with stressed new parents. Can't wait to go in person some day.",5,8/25/2020,Stillwater
83,This is the all time best place to go for brunch and drinks. John is the most caring and generous server I have ever had. The food is phenomenal! The overall vibe is immaculate and I couldn't recommend it enough.,5,9/12/2020,Stillwater
84,Second time here and the food is on point. Drinks are wicked good. Had John both times and he is by far one on the best waiters I have ever had. Very nice and personable. Great service. Will definitely continue to come back.,5,9/12/2020,Stillwater
85,Incredible food and even better customer service ! The drinks are awesome and I don't have a single complaint. Would highly recommend John as your waiter. Overall 11 out of 10!,5,9/12/2020,Stillwater
86,"I had such an amazing experience at this restaurant, esp since I was eating out after a long time since covid. They have very well managed the social distancing and the outdoor seating is just perfect. We ordered the brussel sprouts for starters and they were out of the world, one of the best I have ever had. The Wild Mushroom Ricotta Cheese Dumplings were a treat for the main course, really creamy texture and perfect blend of taste and presentation. Would definitely recommend the place for a casual evening dinner.",4,9/18/2020,Stillwater
87,"Servers are super nice.  Food was good, but portions are HUGE. Additionally, if you aren't used to fried food all of the food can seem heavy. Wish they had more healthy options. My husband and I shared one dish and we felt like we overate and needed to eat veggies for the rest of the week after.",4,10/10/2020,Stillwater
88,Tom is an amazing bartender. My boyfriend and I turned him into a guide of the city and with no hesitation he helped us!! Besides my amazing cocktail he gave me further insight on my trip! Thank you to the establishment and our new friend Tom!,5,10/30/2020,Stillwater
89,"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch and had such a great experience. They have outdoor seating tucked away in the back and it's so cute and pleasant. The atmosphere is really nice, service is great, and the food is even better. We first ordered the chef's choice pancakes to share, and that day i believe it was some sort of cranberry/orange pancakes with chocolate. Absolutely delicious! It was a little sweet with all the chocolate but I loved that. Looking back, we probably could've had the pancakes for dessert after our meal but I personally don't think it spoiled our main entrees at all! I ordered the steak and blue pita sandwich and really enjoyed it! The caramelized onions and blue cheese were a great combination, and it went so well with the steak and pita. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich that was on Texas toast, and he also really liked his. Who doesn't love Texas toast! The chips were a great side~ they weren't just boring potato chips, they had such a great crunch and yummy seasoning. Overall this place was a 10/10 and I would absolutely come back. Not to mention the cocktails were delicious! I loved each one we had (Thank U Next, the 405, and Apple Cider Mule). I think you can't go wrong here!",5,11/9/2020,Stillwater
90,My roommates and I ate here as a celebratory dinner and we were the only ones dining which was AWESOME. The food was spectacular. Brussel sprouts were wonderful. True visceral experience. The super tall server was awesome.,5,12/6/2020,Stillwater
91,Popped in here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon; felt clean and safe in terms of COVID protocols!We had the Everything Bagel Popcorn and Pulled Pork Mac and Cheese - super happy with both! The Mac and cheese was really creamy and the pork was flavorful but not overpowering. Definitely hit the spot in terms of a cozy comforting meal on a chilly winter day.,5,12/19/2020,Stillwater
92,"OMG I ordered the mac 'n cheese with pulled pork last night and it was out of this world good. We got the Brussels sprouts side as well. Just finished off the leftovers for lunch and am so happy. We've also ordered the fried chicken here and it's super yummy too! Great place, great chef, nice people.",5,1/8/2021,Stillwater
93,"First time at Stillwater and will definitely be back! Had the classic eggs benedict at brunch and was not disappointed! Everything on the menu looked so good, I can't wait to try more. Staff were very friendly and all COVID guidelines were enforced to ensure a safe dining experience. Highly recommend!",5,1/17/2021,Stillwater
94,"Sad to see a place this good be so empty. Between our party of four, we had the poppy seed crusted tuna, blistered shishito peppers, and the deviled eggs to start.  The shishito peppers came with a delicious hummus and sliced pita - I'd definitely recommend this appetizer.For entrees, amongst us we had a Kingston Bowl (salad), a Steak and Blue Pita, Cuban Black Beans and Rice w/charred flank steak, and the Smoked Chicken Chili. Everyone was very happy with their food. The dishes came arrived attractively prepared and at the right temperatures. Although I did not try the steak, I heard it was done to perfection. The chili was excellent, as was the biscuit which was served alongside it.This restaurant has a very nice vibe, great cocktails, solid beer menu, and seems like they kitchen is nailing all their regular dishes. It's the type of place I will make an effort to visit when I'm in town again.",5,1/18/2021,Stillwater
95,Nice quiet little restaurant. Very respectful waitress. The food comes out fast too. My favorite item was the donut holes!!!,5,1/23/2021,Stillwater
96,Went here on super bowl for a quick bite and cocktails. The bread and biscuits...to die for. Absolutely delicious. Flaky and savory. Everything you want when you think of a biscuit. We also shared the empanadas. The dough was flaky and crunchy on the outside but soft and buttery on the inside. So so good! The cocktails...I could have sat there and drank all night. I will definitely be back!,5,3/1/2021,Stillwater
97,I was very pleases to see them still going strong. We visited before COVID happened. It was great then and was still great now. If i lived closer I would be here all the time. Next time I'm getting the pulled pork Mac n cheese. If you haven't been it a place you need to try. Side note: my daughter who loved to watch the owner / chef cook loved seeing a strong woman figure out there killing it.,5,3/27/2021,Stillwater
98,Website states reservations required for parties of ten or more. Did not have any method to make reservations for smaller parties. Took a twenty dollar Uber to be told that they are reservation only.,1,3/27/2021,Stillwater
99,"Absolutely amazing food, service and location. The patio is spacious and perfectly situated near Chinatown. The waiters were attentive and made me feel safe to dine out. Food wise I really enjoyed the breakfast potatoes. It's a mix of sweet potatoes and potatoes and it's crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The brunch sandwich was also to die for. The egg was perfectly fried and seasoned. Highly recommend to go with friends or if you are trying to show friends/family around Boston!",5,3/27/2021,Stillwater
100,"This place is DIVINE. It is one of the best brunches I have EVER had. The vibes are immaculate. You can see the kitchen, the music is lovely, and the service was great! Their menu has items I have never seen anywhere else. I usually stick to omelettes when I go to brunch, but I went outside of my comfort zone and got the Empanadas Rancheros and I think it's actually the best decision I've ever made. The tomato base was to die for, the eggs were light and airy, and the empanadas were amazing. Everything tasted amazing on its own, but all together it just melded so beautifully. Also the potatoes were great. It was a mix of I believe russet, purple, and sweet. The sweet potatoes were next level. I would come back to Boston just for this restaurant, it was perfect.",5,3/29/2021,Stillwater
101,"My husband and I were just looking for lunch in the Chinatown area and found this. We were craving comfort food and let me tell you- this place got it covered.Delectable double patty burger, pork Mac and cheese, and Buffalo wings for two people. The wings were flavorful, saucy, and delicious (Buffalo) and the burger split between two people was sufficient and delicious. The Mac and Cheese- well look at the pictures because- ahmazing.The cocktails tasted good but felt a bit weak. Would definitely come again for the food.",5,3/29/2021,Stillwater
102,"Very happy to see this restaurant has made it through the pandemic! I visited in February 2020 - right before the pandemic hit - and finally made it back here. They still had the same comforting atmosphere and menu, but added a patio offering to comply with COVID-19 safety measures. The wait staff are really friendly and helpful, offering recommendations on dishes and wine pairings.",5,4/7/2021,Stillwater

104,"Stillwater was decent. The portions are a good size and the prices are okay (a little high). I wished the theme of the food (southern comfort) came through in the interior design of the space. Everything we ordered was tasty except for the chicken wings; they were hard and dry. We order the burrata, veggie burger, ritz crusted chicken  and the ragu. Not a bad experience just not spectacular either.",4,4/22/2021,Stillwater
105,"Had a delicious meal with friends last night. We had the biscuits, deviled eggs, popcorn, ritz chicken, pulled pork and Cobb salad between the 4 of us. Everything was great including our service from John Brewer the owner. Highly recommend!!",5,4/25/2021,Stillwater

107,"Great spot for a meal right by Chinatown. Plenty of room both indoors or outdoors which is particularly important for those of us slowly returning to indoor dining. I came for brunch which if you come in early you can just walk in without a reservation. Though it was getting busier as time went on. I opted to order the Classic which is your typical eggs, sausage, potatoes, bread meal. Everything was great and service was good. I would definitely return for brunch or to check out their dinner options.",4,5/15/2021,Stillwater
108,"This spot is heaven for the vegan or vegetarian eater. The menu is clearly labeled, and they are very conscious about dietary restrictions.The atmosphere is very trendy and fun. The restaurant has high seating and tables scattered inside and outside. The kitchen is open so you can watch the food preparation. I would note that sound carries, and it was a bit noisy. Our server was great and regularly checked in.The location is easy to get to with a quick walk from downtown or MBTA from South Station, Downtown Crossing, and Chinatown.We started with the Blistered Shishitos and they were delicious! The hummus was unique and well seasoned. Portions were large and a good size. We both ordered two different salads with steak for our mains but neither was particularly memorable. I think we ordered the wrong items as other menu items looked better.",4,5/19/2021,Stillwater
109,Went during their lunch hour. Loved the patio. For food I had the pollo loco and sweet potato dumplings. Both tasted delicious. Chicken burger was a bit bland,4,5/20/2021,Stillwater
110,Great family friendly Brunch Spot‼Killer Bloody Mary's and Pancakes are to die for ‼,5,5/24/2021,Stillwater
111,"I've eaten here twice and was disappointed in the food, but the location and space is nice.",2,6/9/2021,Stillwater
112,"Was recommended for brunch and found the establishment to be delightful and the food to die for! The 421 and Kingston dishes were absolutely delicious, and I highly recommend the bloody mary which comes with a slice of bacon. The staff was attentive & friendly. I'll be recommending this brunch spot to others.",5,6/19/2021,Stillwater
113,"Been wanting to try this spot for a while and I finally made it! I got their flat patty burger, which consists of your typical brioche bun, cheddar cheese, two patties, and LTO and it came with fries. I really liked the bun and the burger was great overall but something about it fell just a teeny bit flat. I also got the strawberry moscow mule which was a solid 10/10 can't go wrong with a mule. We did have to ask for napkins and utensils but our server was training so completely understandable. I'd like to come back and try their brunch menu!",4,6/24/2021,Stillwater
114,"Pretty cool spot, with a great vibe and a good mix of a menu. Comfort meets hipster. And that's a compliment. It's fresh, strong flavors for the basic bar fare. The cocktails are better than expected, and aptly named. You will want to hangout and just vibe in this place",5,6/26/2021,Stillwater
115,"This was my 1st time here for brunch and everything was delicious. The service was great. The flavors were great and everything was on point from the deviled eggs oooh so creamy and the chicken skins gave it the right amount of salt, the Kingston bowl salad was light and refreshing and light, the chicken epanada plate was great as well as my honey hot chicken plate I got scrambled with chedder instead of over easy both entrees came with home fries with a tri color medley of potatoes which was a great idea. Must get the Thank you next cocktail to bring the heat. All the drinks looked good. I'd definitely eat here again!",5,6/27/2021,Stillwater
116,Excellent first experienceJust had a cocktail which was great - strawberry muleAlso had the ribeye which was also delicious.Great space with a patioWould definitely return,5,6/30/2021,Stillwater
117,"A friend suggested Stillwater once for dinner- and its true what they say... good things come when we don't go looking for it!Stillwater is one of those places that I thoroughly enjoy coming back for more, the food is well balanced in flavor and has generous portion sizes. And the food is fairly cheap relative to Boston prices!The smoked chicken chili is a must try, especially when the weather/life is not cooperating (rain/snow/feeling sad)! I also LOOOOOVE dark chocolate, so the lava cake was really amazing. For nearly $10, it was a bit small for a dessert... maybe the size of a small navel orange. I think if the lava cake was a bit bigger, I would say I found ""the one"", but till then I am still on my search for the best dark chocolate dessert in Boston.",5,7/11/2021,Stillwater
118,"everything we got here was so good!our order:* baked burrata cheese in roasted tomato sauce w/ basil oil + chef's focaccia* ritz crusted fried chicken, whipped potatoes, charred onion butter* grilled australian lamb chops w/ crunchy onion potatoes, herb + dijon pan sauce, garlic french beansno pic of pbj creme brûlée",5,7/17/2021,Stillwater
119,"Fairly good food, nice seating, AMAZING environment the waiters were awesome and food came out relatively quick,",4,7/19/2021,Stillwater
120,"Don't sleep on the Blistered Shishitos and Ricotta Donuts. The staff get very excited when the donuts arrive, because they know. The Run Wild non-alcoholic IPA is also very good.",5,7/21/2021,Stillwater
121,Food is great but the waiting staff and service are pretty bad. Lots of attitude which overshadows the delicious food.,3,7/27/2021,Stillwater
122,"Wow, such good food and a really cute space. Eggs Benedict was phenomenal. Real hidden gem.",5,7/31/2021,Stillwater
123,"Enjoyed this place on the recommendation of someone I met at the hotel. Somewhat reminded me of Jones in Philadelphia for those familiar. Nice selection of comfort food. Decent local beer list. Friendly staff. Wouldn't mind hanging out at the bar from the looks of it. Full dinner Deviled Eggs, a salmon dish, Cuban rice/beans w/chicken and a burger. All were delicious and worth the money.",4,8/5/2021,Stillwater
124,"Ok, yes. Comfort food as the cuisine? And they do it right!! The staff was so nice we ended up having 7 people instead of 6 and it was no issue. We started with the burrata and the biscuits. The cheese came with a few pieces of bread on the side and roasted tomatoes. It was delicious. The biscuits were served with warm butter for dipping. For my meal I got the flat patty burger. It was delicious and so filling. I would say it was one of the best burgers I've gotten in Boston and it wasn't very expensive either! I love this little spot I want to try everything on the menu! Super cute vibes and a great location.",5,8/14/2021,Stillwater
125,"We were disappointed with our experience at Stillwater. We had high hopes, but both the food and drinks were very average. All of our meals tasted like something we could have easily made at home. The service was slow- we had to wait almost 20 minutes for our table even though we'd made a reservation. Our server kept clearing our plates/cups before we were done. At one point they asked one person if they'd like another cocktail. That person said yes, but then the server brought another round of drinks for the entire table, even though two peoples' drinks were still completely full! Because of this, our tab was almost $200 for a very basic meal.",3,8/21/2021,Stillwater
126,"We went to Stillwater not knowing what to expect. The food was excellent, the menu was incredibly diverse (Mac& cheese fried chick, ritz cracker crusted trout, etc). We had carrot hummus which we loved. The Brussel sprouts and veggie burger were good. Great atmosphere.",5,9/6/2021,Stillwater
127,Went there for lunch today based on previous Yep reviews and I'm so glad I did. We sat inside at the bar although there was outdoor seating available. The cocktail menu is inventive and our drinks were great. I had the fried chicken sandwich and my friend had the flat patty burger. There are so many great options and we could have even ordered from the brunch menu. We shared our sandwiches and they were delicious and filling. I had house chips and they were also great. There's even a sweet menu but we were stuffed. I'll for sure go again!,5,9/11/2021,Stillwater
128,"A seriously off night (I assume) for Stillwater. Saturday at 7 pm, the two of us walked in without reservations and we were seated immediately outside--pleasant patio, loud traffic noise from Essex st. The server took our app order for biscuits described as ""Warm homemade crumbly bleu cheese and thyme biscuits."" Those came quickly, and were warm and homemade and crumbly but we didn't taste any bleu cheese or thyme. We waited a long, long ""thyme"" for another contact with staff and realized there was only the one server for the entire restaurant. Losing patience, we left, apologized to our server that we couldn't wait, she was very understanding and comped our biscuits. Disappointing evening given the generally great reviews.",3,9/11/2021,Stillwater
129,"My friends and I were really excited to try this resturant. We saw how many positive reviews there were and we were dying  for some comfort food. The atmosphere was very nice, but the restaurant was very empty. The food was extremely bland and unseasoned. I personally ordered the pulled pork Mac and cheese and the chicken wings. I would have preferred if they gave me boxed Kraft instead. The buffalo chicken tasted like only salt and smoke. There was no flavor, pepper, or anything. Only one of my friends was happy with the food and they ordered the burger. We wanted to get dessert but were so disappointed we went elsewhere. I'm giving it two stars because the restaurant was clean and the service was good.",2,9/13/2021,Stillwater
130,"Atmosphere was good but would not return due to mediocre food. Burger was meh (patty wasn't especially flavorful and sauce was a bit strange, like ranch) and pulled pork Mac and cheese was okay. Not sure why this place is so overrated.",3,9/18/2021,Stillwater
131,Reservations for 8:30 and the restaurant closed at 10 pm  party of 8 for a birthday we eating and drinking but after the lights were turned on we were rushed out. Food was alright and service slow.  It's definitely not a late night spot and more concerned about the brunch set up next day.,1,9/19/2021,Stillwater
132,THE BEST breakfast/brunch place in Boston.Everything on the menu is great; it doesn't matter what you order. I usually go with the Hot Honey Chicken & Biscuits or The 421. Both are savory and will fill you up.The owners work in the restaurant. You'll notice their stellar service and the care put into your experience.  Do not pass this up if you're in the area.,5,9/25/2021,Stillwater
133,"Do NOT order the cuban beans and rice, it was such a rip off. I'm shocked that I paid $18 for plain beans and rice with an egg. The dish was unseasoned, super plain and had clearly been microwaved...",3,9/30/2021,Stillwater
134,"Of course I'm recommending this place! What's not to recommend about Stillwater! They are ""badass."" The deviled eggs are wicked, the outdoor seating is fabulous, convenient to get off the T and walk to this place! The vegetarian options aren't poor, but could do with a few more options. Service is great.Hygienic.Friendly staffOverall a good experience! Must go again!",4,10/10/2021,Stillwater
135,Excellent! Friendly and delish food! Staff was happy to be there and happy to make your meal as lovely as possible.,5,10/12/2021,Stillwater
136,"Atmosphere and service were great, but the food was just fine and needed punchier flavor for me.We started with the brussel sprouts which were good. I liked the vinaigrette but there was hardly any bacon and even the vinaigrette left you wanting more cuz it was so thin and washed off the sprouts. We had the chicken chili, Cuban rice and beans, and Cobb salad. The Cobb salad was the best part as the lemon dressing was great, finally a good, strong flavor. And there were plenty of toppings. Great bacon - quite lean - and a nice sliced egg. Would definitely get the Cobb again. The smoked chicken chili was fine but just screaming out for a bolder, maybe spicier flavor. It did have a lot of chicken tho, probably the best value in the menu (which isn't a cheap menu). The Cuban rice and beans was the same story, just too simple and really needing some bolder flavor. For the prices, I probably wouldn't go back.",3,10/17/2021,Stillwater
137,"Great service, good food. Good atmosphere. I like places where you can see the whole kitchen and nice bar",5,10/27/2021,Stillwater
138,The food at this restaurant exceeded all my expectations!!! Literally one of the best meals I've had in my life. I got the sweet potato ricotta dumplings and the parmesan mushroom salad with Ritz chicken. So delicious and savory!!! Service and ambiance were also fantastic!!! Go here! You will not be disappointed!!,5,10/31/2021,Stillwater
139,"Cool vibe to the restaurant- lighting, tables, chairs were all very cool We had the burrata app and it was pretty good. We had a lot of sauce/cheese left over after we finished the initial pieces of bread, so our server brought us more. Super nice! I ordered the cobb salad and it was also pretty good. Kitchen forgot the avocado and the tomatoes weren't marinated, but still a decent salad. Our server brought me a couple slices of avocado from the kitchen when I mentioned it :)Boyfriend ordered the pulled pork with fries. The pulled pork was GREAT, but the fries were underdone. Despite being underdone, the taste was great. The chicken chili was also good. Definitely made with good ingredients. Just a little salty. The biscuit that came with it was deciduous!",4,11/3/2021,Stillwater
140,"Great food and drinks- plenty of options for everyone. The biscuits and butter are a must have, they are very good.  Very reasonable prices (between 2 cocktails, 3 apps, 2 entrees and 1 dessert entire bill was only $120). Laid back atmosphere with tons of seating. Parking in the area between finding a street meter and a few lots/garages nearby. Would recommend.",5,11/6/2021,Stillwater
141,We stumbled on Stillwater our first night in Boston when we were searching for somewhere near our hotel to have dinner. I'm so glad we found it because it ended up being the best dinner we had in Boston the whole time we were there! Lots of creative dishes and the food was top quality. We loved the sweet potato ricotta dumplings....never had anything like that before. Every dish we had was great. I highly recommend Stillwater if you're in the Boston area!,5,11/20/2021,Stillwater
142,"The food was pretty mediocre with a service to match. No idea why this place is highly rated. Maybe it is a tourist destination or maybe the chef was out the day before thanksgiving. We ordered the Cuban rice and beans for the kids (hard to mess that up, right? Guess again), I ordered Mesclun salad or something which had a mush mash of terrible things like limp lettuce, hummus which tasted like it came out of a can, an avocado which looked like it had been sitting out longer than I have been alive, some sort of in flavorful cold grain situation, etc. My wife ordered a salad with sesame crusted tuna (I think), and the tuna was even limper than the lettuce. Even the biscuit was disappointing.",2,11/25/2021,Stillwater
143,"Tucked away between Chinatown and South Station, Stillwater is known for elevated, fancy, comfort food. Who doesn't like comfort food? They also have a fantastic cocktail list with very creative cocktails like ""Thank you, Next"", ""Boston Three Party"", ""The 405"". I had the ""Strawberry Mules Forever"" which consisted of vodka, lime juice, strawberry and ginger beer, basically a strawberry Moscow mule. It was great!I came here to eat dinner and decided to have the braised lamb ragu with homemade pappardelle pasta. The lamb was very tender, and the homemade pasta was delicious. If you want comfort food with a fancy twist, as well as cocktails, you will love Stillwater.",4,11/29/2021,Stillwater
144,"Pretty good brunch place for Boston. Came here on Saturday with a large party and didn't have to wait long for a table. The service was good and the waitress split the bill for all of us which was very nice. The food was good, The Hot honey Chicken and Biscuits are the best thing on the menu though everything else was a little bland. It was very easy to get to using the T.",4,11/30/2021,Stillwater
145,"We went to Stillwater for a last minute dinner as we were late to our planned one. We didn't have a reservation and were able to walk in on a weekend. We got seated and served right away!We ordered the burger which was delicious along with the pulled pork Mac and cheese which was very filling. Both meals satisfied our stomachs and we were pleased with the service. Overall, would recommend!",4,12/2/2021,Stillwater
146,"This place is known for their cocktails, but a few friends and I came here for supper. My Cobb salad with a veggie patty was delicious and my friends enjoyed their veggie burger and sweet potato/ricotta dumplings. The menu is definitely limited and vegetarians have a couple of options at most, however they do have some interesting appetizers on there! Service was decent, and we were able to make a reservation the day of. A super convenient dinner if you're trying to catch a train!",3,12/11/2021,Stillwater
147,Great drinks and loved the sweet potato ricotta dumplings. Unfortunately there were only three small dumplings but the sauce was so delicious.,5,12/18/2021,Stillwater
148,"Overall solid experience at Stillwater, nothing that came out disappointed. If you're looking for some comforting and classic American food near seaport & chinatown, look no further. Got the Brussels sprouts, biscuits, empanadas, and more to start and all were delicious. I got the pappardelle and finished it all. My friends got the pulled pork Mac n cheese, the burger, and salads and they are all good. Also loved their cocktails! Got their version of a hot toddy and the thank you next and both were great!follow me on ig @ sophiaeaaats for more recs!",5,12/31/2021,Stillwater
149,"A group of girlfriends and I were looking for a nice restaurant to enjoy dinner on NYE. We didn't want to go anywhere too crowded or rowdy as COVID has been on the rise this season. Stillwater was the perfect place - they require mandatory masks and have good distances between tables and dinner guests. It also wasn't too crowded inside. The food was delicious! We had the burrata as appetizer along with the empanaditas. The burrata was delicious, you'll want to ask for extra bread to finish the dip. The empanaditas were stuffed with chicken and were nice and crispy on the outside, an order only comes with two so if you'd like this appetizer for the table you'll need to order a couple or split them in halves.A couple of my friends ordered the lamb chops and couldn't stop raving about them. I got the crispy salmon and enjoyed the salmon but the risotto rice was quite grainy, unsure what type of rice they used. I likely won't order the salmon again but would definitely go back here for more appetizers and cocktails!",5,1/2/2022,Stillwater
150,Excellent food...excellent service (Luke was extremely friendly and helpful).  Loved the music playlist,5,1/5/2022,Stillwater
151,"First let me say that first impressions make lasting ones and John the manager left us with a really bad first impression... So imagine walking to the restaurant in 21 degree weather with 3 kids with sleds (that they can carry) for about 2 1/2 miles only for one of the kids to attempt to open the door and be told by John that  if we are coming in to come in because it's cold outside...... first of all you do NOT address anyone in that tone...let alone a child.  Secondly, as a MANAGER, seeing that our hands were full,  he could have said hey,  let me get the door for you, welcome..  it was freezing outside so we know it's cold... not once did he Welcome us to his restaurant. He simply walked away.. my question is how are you a manager and have this sort of customer service??? Is this the image that you want of your restaurant??   For the manager not being able to greet us, acknowledge our presence in his facility or give us eye contact, clearly means there was something else going on there....We came here based on the reviews so after walking for so long in the cold and the kids were pretty tired, we said let's just stay and eat... the dishes were priced fairly... we ordered flat burgers, ritz chicken, a chicken sandwich and pulled pork Mac and Cheese... I honestly have nothing good to say about the food, it was Bland and flavorless... The food came out with good temperature, I must say but the taste was not there...A message to the management team: please ensure proper training with your team members. The interaction with John was unacceptable and should be addressed. We are living in a time where businesses are suffering, therefore, when people come into your business and decide to spend their hard earned money in your facility, you need to acknowledge them and provide better service...",1,1/9/2022,Stillwater
152,"First things first! Stillwater ordered takeout today 1/9/22  and whoever put my order together didn't give me silverware?! This was awful! Come on smh!! Now the good part, the food was AWESOME very pleased with my purchase! The Salmon with the risotto was mouthwatering Risotto was cooked perfectly not over cooked, the Salmon was moist and very tasty. The Brussel sprouts with the goat cheese was very good. The Deviled eggs was excellent. I will definitely be ordering again from Stillwater for dinner while at work for my break, just promise me not to forget my silverware Lol!",5,1/9/2022,Stillwater
153,"Asked for no cheese or sour cream (lactose intolerance) in the chicken chili and got a lot of both. It was also literally only chicken and broth, no veggies or beans or anything. Chips were over cooked, and got pasta salad instead of potato salad as ordered. Pretty brutal experience overall.",1,1/29/2022,Stillwater
154,"I would give 3.5 stars. This restaurant is located at a convenient distance from the train station. Flavor wise, it is the epitome of American comfort food. Food I've tried: (* = my favorite)- BICUITS AND BUTTER ($7): I am personally a fan of flaky biscuits, and these were on the crumbly side. My personal taste aside, the dough was slightly salty. - ROASTED BRUSSEL SPROUTS* ($8.50): I would say this was the best dish of the meal. The brussels sprouts were not tough at all, and they were very well prepared. The sauce and the topping of goat cheese paired nicely. - WARM BURRATA ($12): it was a standard burrata dish. The tomato sauce was not overly salty, the focaccia was exactly what you expect from focaccia. - HANGOVER BURGER ($17): the meat itself was well prepared and seasoned. The caramelized garlic was great, added a sweet flavor. The brioche bun was ok, not the most amazing bun I've had but a very standard bun. I did note that the plate was 70% tater tots and 30% burger. For $17, the burger was on the smaller side (the patties were the size of a post it note). The tater tots were very salty.- SMOKED PULLED PORK SANDWHICH ($14): presentation wise, it looks quite impressive with the meat piled on top of the bread. Flavor wise, it reminded me of something that I could make at home. As in, it was a very standard pulled pork sandwich, nothing overly spectacular. I did appreciate that the meat was not overly salted. - SMOKED PORK MAC & CHEESE ($16): again, very standard mac & cheese.Atmosphere:- I loved the interior vibe of the place. It is very nicely decorated, very cozy yet classy.- We visited on a Friday evening. Looking at the reservation on their website, there were no reservation spots available. We wanted to take our chances with walk in. When we arrived the restaurant was quite empty. All this to say, a reservation may not be necessary unless you have a large party. Service:- Extremely friendly. We got our food reasonably fast. Overall:- I would say it is solid comfort food that reminds you of the flavors you make at home. The price is reasonable, but it is still a decent amount of money to spend on ""homey food."" Personally, I look for flavors that I cannot quite replicate at home when eating out hence the 3.5 stars.",4,1/30/2022,Stillwater
155,"So so so good!! We ended up coming here after our other dinner option closed early and I'm so glad it happened! Phenomenal cheese board and the empanaditas were out of this world! Great for date night, great vibes!",5,1/31/2022,Stillwater
156,"The restaurant is situated between Downtown, Chinatown, and the leather district. If you're driving, There is a decent amount of meter parking in front and close to the restaurant and worst case there are a few parking lots close by. One item to note, you will need to navigate a series of one way streets so if you plan on driving, be prepared for confusing downtown Boston streets.We enjoyed a nice late brunch. Our server was very nice but there was clearly not enough servers to tables, but that's pretty normal these days. I got the 421, which was very good. The only thing that I didn't get much of was the hot oil, it ended up pooping at the bottom of my cast iron plate. I added some hot sauce (a Mexican salsa Rona hot sauce) and it gave it a very nice kick. Wifey got the chicken and biscuits which she also enjoyed. The brunch potatoes were from different potatoes, gold, purple and sweet potatoes and were nicely crisped. Wifey loves sweet potatoes so those went first. The portions were solid and we walked away happy and satisfied. I will definitely return to try other items in the menu.",4,2/17/2022,Stillwater
157,"Super cute place with great staff. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu. We got a white pizza and it was delicious, next time I'm going to try a red pizza as they make their own sauce.",5,2/24/2022,Stillwater
158,Still water was such a wonderful find.Excellent food and service for a  reasonable upscale price. The barata was exceptional.  Our server Vincent was great. Extremely professional relaxed and friendly. Vincent helped with some menu selections. The Chicken Fried Rib eye and Lamb chops were delicious.If you have room do not leave untill you try the freshly made ricotta donuts.My only suggestion for improvement would be fresh ground coffee.Otherwise a wonderful dining experience.,5,3/5/2022,Stillwater
159,"Good solid comfort food is what we got here and that's Just what we were looking for. Deviled eggs and popcorn with bagel spice and warm butter for starters, for dinner we had the Ritz cracker crusted chicken thighs And the Rachel sandwich on Iggy's Rye bread, and finished with the PBand j  Crème brûlée.Good food at a good price, I would recommend a visit if you're in the area.",4,3/6/2022,Stillwater
160,"Stillwater (4.5/5)Stillwater has become my fiance and my go to place for drinks and food before getting on the Amtrak train at South Station on Sundays.  Most other places in the area aren't open mid-afternoon on Sunday, but Stillwater is and they offer some great food and drink at reasonable prices.The wine list is pretty good and very reasonably priced.  I usually will get the Sean Minor Chardonnay and my fiance gets the sparkling rose.  Both are very good.  For food we have ordered an assortment of dishes including the roasted brussel sprouts, the blistered shishitos, the everything bagel popcorn, the daily board, and the sweet potato dumplings.  For dessert we have had the PB & J Creme Brulee and the warm dark chocolate lava cake.Roasted Brussel Sprouts: They were very nicely roasted and went well with the balsamic glaze and goat cheese they were tossed with.  There were nice crispy bits and the tangy goat cheese made for a nice contrast with the greens.Blistered Shishitos: They were pretty good, but eating the peppers themselves got a bit one note after a while.  However, the hummus and warm pita bread they were served with would definitely make it worth ordering by itself.Everything Bagel Popcorn: An incredibly simple concept that just worked really really well.  The dish is simply a bowl of popcorn topped with everything bagel seasoning and served with a side of melted butter.  At only $6 I would definitely urge you to give it a try.The Daily Board: This is a selection of three cheeses (port salut, aged gouda, and Great Hill bleu cheese), cider fig jam, popcorn, mixed olives, grapes, and warm pita bread.  The cheeses were very good and each paired excellently with the cider fig jam on the pita bread. I do wish they had given a bit more pita bread with the board though, as we had to start rationing near the end.Sweet Potato Dumplings: These were really tasty! They are served in a whiskey cream sauce with mushrooms and pearl onions and all of the flavors go together very well.  The sauce by itself was delicious and I found myself eat the sauce up with a spoon at the end when the dumplings were gone.PB & J Creme Brulee:  A great choice for dessert.  The creme brulee is peanut butter flavored and is topped with a strawberry compote and candied peanuts.  All of the flavors went together so well! The candied peanuts were also a treat! I do wish they included a bit more of the strawberry compote since it was so good.Warm Dark Chocolate Lava Cake: How can you go wrong with a lava cake? This was incredibly good and the raspberry sauce and vanilla bourbon gelato went so well with it.  If you can't choose between this and the creme brulee, be like us and order both!Overall I have been incredibly happy with Stillwater and the food has been solid.  My only real complaint is that the service has been a bit slow the two times we have gone.  However, I am willing to forgive that as we go at a bit of an odd hour (around 3pm) and I am sure the recent staffing shortages have made it hard to hire more people.",5,3/7/2022,Stillwater
161,"It's very noisy!  Besides the loudness, the food was tremendous!  We ordered lots of appetizers.  Not even a real fan of deviled eggs, but wow were they great.  We had the popcorn - unique and yummy!  The rolls with the butter are truly amazing.  The spicy chicken wings were decent ... not too spicy.  I'll be back for the popcorn and deviled eggs!",5,3/19/2022,Stillwater
162,"My friends and I went to Stillwater over the weekend.Overall a great meal,'like always.4.8/5 stars Service 4/5The service was pretty good. We had a nice waiter, food/drinks came out in good time.My one complaint would be the waiter didn't come back for a while for us to order a second round of drinks. We probably would've had 3 rounds of drinks had they been a bit more on top of things. Not that big of a deal though.Drinks 5/5Everyone loved the drinks they got. The espresso martini is definitely a must. Delicious. I'd recommend any of the drinks tbh.Food 5/5Everyone loved all the food. We all picked at a few appetizers. The burrata was amazing, popcorn was a cool little snack, and the pork rinds are a MUST! For entrees, I personally got the Mac and cheese. One of the best Mac and cheeses I've ever had. Overall, a great meal. It's right downtown, accesible to a bunch of things, cute atmosphere, and in general a great pick for a downtown dinner.Follow my insta for more photos of food/places to eat! @devinchute",5,3/28/2022,Stillwater

164,The restaurant requires a credit card to make a reservation. We thought it would not be busy on a Tueaday night and we could just walk in. It was busy and no table was available. We sit at the bar area.The food was good. I especially like the cherry pepper relish on my chicken fried ribeye. I somehow felt the staffs are all looked tired. We were not attended in the beginning but we got good service afterwards.,4,4/6/2022,Stillwater
165,"Great food, great atmosphere.  My wife and I totally blew our diet but it was worth it!  Fir apps had the warm burrata w crushed tomatoes and toasted focccacia bread as well as the buttered thyme biscuits!  So good!  My wife had the pulled pork over mac and cheese, so creamy so tender so tasty!  I had the braised Lamb ragu with papardelle pasta and shaved parm cheese.  Nice!  Topped it off with dessert of a warm apple crumble and coffee.  The crumble was topped with vanilla gelato and the cool gelato complemented the warm crumble so well, mmmmm!  The wife asked for a little gelato too and was rewarded with a bowl of her own (generally it just comes w the crumble, but they bent the rules!) Lol so good!  If you are in Boston, come here and eat!!!",5,4/7/2022,Stillwater
166,"Good concepts very poorly executed.Sweet potato ricotta ravioli - 2.5/5. Relies too heavily on heavy cream. It is a great concept of fresh mushrooms, roasted garlic, fully stuffed ravioli and herbs in the sauce. Perhaps it was insufficient seasoning but it all felt a bit boring and didn't get better brought together in a bite. The only technical issue was the pasta was chewy.Peanut butter creme Brulee - 2/5. Fun idea. The peanuts surprisingly work. But the creme Brulee itself wasn't set properly so the texture was all off.",2,4/11/2022,Stillwater
167,Party of 2 tonight sat 6 inches away from table with another party of 2.  The food was mediocre. It gets 3 stars and not 2 because of the Gin Blossoms cocktail.,3,4/16/2022,Stillwater
168,"Came here for our last meal in Boston and ordered a few things:Biscuits & ButterRoasted Brussels SproutsHouse saladKingston SaladThe biscuits are delicious especially with the butter (we ordered them without the chicken drippings). Ask the waiter to make sure the biscuits are WARM. Roasted Brussels sprouts could have been skipped. It was a bit soggy, and aside from the goat cheese, the taste wasn't there. Salads were both very fresh and delicious. A nice light refreshing meal after a week of eating fried fat laden foods! Overall I would come back to try the burgers, fried chicken and the other salads!",3,4/24/2022,Stillwater
169,"Overall we were really satisfied here. It was a fun atmosphere and the food was spot on. The chicken empanaditas were excellent. The sweet potato gnocchi dish was stellar. The food was fresh, delivered quickly, and tasty. Really, the main issue we had was that the bench seating is designed for who knows what kind of person. You sink into the cushions and then the table is too high and far. It was awkward!We will definitely be back but just choose another table.",4,4/24/2022,Stillwater
170,"Nice modern and spacious restaurant near South Station. Came at 11am for lunch before heading out on the train. The service was good, but the food was not, especially being on a low-carb diet. The deviled eggs were a good but ordinary, the warm burrata was tough (unable to cut and too big to eat) with the tomato sauce ordinary and in too much abundance. The Cobb salad was decent, but the flank steak add-on was not cooked to order and was a very tough piece of meat with gristle throughout. We would not recommend.",2,4/30/2022,Stillwater
171,"Me and my boyfriend went and were both unable to finish our meals , despite being very hungry, because of the food. I'm sorry but this food was not good at all I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The only reason I won't give this place a one star is because the atmosphere inside was nice and staff was friendly. Bad food.",2,5/10/2022,Stillwater
172,Menu options were terrible. They didnt have much to choose from. Got 3 appetizers and they were okay. Wait time was pretty long. I honestly wont be back here unfortunately.,2,5/24/2022,Stillwater
173,"Amazing food and outstanding service! Within minutes of ordering, my food arrived hot and tasty.",5,5/30/2022,Stillwater
174,Great drinks and food.   Nice friendly service.   Recommended!!  We got the sweet potato ricotta dumplings and the Buffalo chicken wings.   Yum!,4,6/7/2022,Stillwater
175,"Visited Stillwater for a friend's birthday dinner and boy, did they deliver! Our amazing and friendly server, Jay, helped us choose drinks and dishes -- a genuinely difficult task, because everything on the menu sounded incredible. Everything came out with great timing: close enough together that we were never left without food, but far enough apart that our table was not overcrowded and the dishes never got cold. We got the warm burrata, pork mac and cheese, roasted Brussels sprouts, and the flat patty burger, along with some apple dessert. We enjoyed everything, but the only thing I might skip is the burger. It was delicious, but really just a burger. Would love to return for brunch!",5,6/10/2022,Stillwater
176,"Honestly I would not recommend this place. The only good thing is the location and the design on the inside. However let me tell you about the food, the burger buns were old and dry, the veggie burger was the worst I ever had, it was cold on the inside and soggy falling apart like it was a mashed potatoes patties. The fries were dark dark brown and burned. How was this even allowed to leave the kitchen and be served to people. And that was just my meal. Everyone in the group ordered different and was surprised with disappointment. Don't go here!",1,6/18/2022,Stillwater
177,Super close to the opera house! Very convenient for a matinee show! Food was awesome! Everything looked good. I will for sure return to try their other dishes!,5,7/5/2022,Stillwater
178,"I had the dill pickle ranch salad with tuna and it was excellent. I also got to partake in the purple drank and highly recommend it! We asked to be seated outside and it was particularly hot in the sun, so we asked could they add an umbrella to our table and they did so right away. The service was fantastic! Look forward to going again.",5,7/9/2022,Stillwater
179,"Stillwater is an amazing restaurant on the outskirts of Boston Chinatown.  It has brunch on Saturday and Sunday until 3pm.  The breakfast tacos had a lot of flavor and were very substantial. The combination of smoked pork, scrambled eggs, and Calabrian chili chive sour cream worked well together.  There is a breakfast entree called Classic Hungry Girl that comes with two eggs cooked the customer's way, two choices of bacon, sausage or avocado, Texas toast, potatoes, pancakes, all for $20.  I ordered the eggs poached and they came out perfectly.  Service each time I have been here has been outstanding.  Professional servers.  There are several tables on the outside patio and the vegetation gives customers some privacy.  Clean bathrooms.",5,7/11/2022,Stillwater
180,"Whenever we take a lil excursion to Boston, we usually stay in Chinatown. We arrived in town straight after a night shift and were tired but famished. The easy solution would be to snag something from Chinatown but nothing quite checked all of the boxes until we came across this place. I had been expecting and preparing my palate for hot pot or Chinese but Stillwater more than filled the noodle and soy sauce hole left behind. We arrived just as the clock struck noon and there was ample seating available at that time but the tables began to fill during our visit. We elected to sit outside on their patio under an umbrella.The service was great. There weren't many other patrons so minimal competition for the staff's attention who were friendly and attentive. The waitress arrived in short order to take our drink order which was a whole issue in of itself because how do you choose just one when they have titillating shit like frozen strawberry lemonade (jack, lemonade, lemon juice, and strawberry monin) the 405 (aperol, sweet vermouth, grapefruit juice, prosecco float) and amanda hugnkiss (rum, kalani coconut, triple sec, lime juice, passion fruit puree). Ultimately, I started with the purple drank (blueberry vodka, persimmon, lemon juice, hibiscus syrup, prosecco float) which was not only tasty but strong. You know, for the sole purpose of writing this review, I needed more data so I ordered the island mule (vodka, lime juice, mango puree, ginger beer) which was absolutely delightful. Tina, again purely for the sake of writing this review, also ordered two beverages. Her first was thank you next (tequila, triple sec, lime juice, cucumber, simple syrup) which she describes, as per usual, as ""good"". For her second, she ordered the slow burn (mezcal, blanco tequila, grapefruit syrup, agave, citrus bitters) but it didn't do the trick, was too bitter for her taste. We started the solid portion of our meal off with the burrata appetizer. They have since changed this on the menu (in a week, wow, impressive). Ours was in essentially an oil soup with tomatoes and a delicious seasoning and accompanied by something in the focaccia family. It was a touch oily for my taste but I mean, you really can't fuck up burrata, bread, and tomatoes. It appears that the new version is cold with salsa verde, mushrooms, and parmesan crackers and I hate to say it but what we had sounds better. I wanted some greens to keep things moving if you know what I mean and completely lost my shit when I saw their dill pickle salad on the menu: lettuce with turmeric couscous, shaved radish and scallion, buttery brioche crumbs tossed in a mother fucking DILL PICKLE RANCH. As if ranch couldn't get any better. Needless to say this salad was orgasmic. It was a little too heavily dressed which usually disgusts me but I would drank that ranch from a glass. Because we couldn't decide for ourselves, GF and I elected to split the salad and their creole veggie burger which prepped our palate for an upcoming trip to New Orleans with black eyed pea and bulgur wheat patty, swiss cheese, pickle remoulade, and lettuce on a toasted brioche bun and served with hand cut fries. The flavors of the burger were incredible and the fries were crisp AF. We were quite loose by this point after the cocktails and fuck it, we ordered dessert. Our server recommended the ricotta donut holes were perfect to share. Tossed in powdered sugar and served with a chocolate sauce for dipping, they topped our meal off nicely.We had a lovely time at Stillwater and would absolutely recommend paying this place a visit.",5,7/13/2022,Stillwater
181,The cheese board and cocktails were fantastic! We thoroughly enjoyed the evening air on the patio.,4,7/16/2022,Stillwater
182,All of the staff was very friendly and attentive I missed my train and so I came here to get a quick grazing board to eat on the next train. For $19 I expected something better than a kids lunchable this restaurant looks too nice for the quality of a dish to look like this.,3,7/17/2022,Stillwater
183,"I was in Boston and was looking for a decent vegan/vegetarian friendly place to have my dinner and the yelp reviews led me here. They have a few good vegetarian options on their menu. They don't have anything vegan specifically on the menu, but they could take out the diary/cheese and customize and make it vegan for you.I liked the black bean burger and my friends loved their meat/chicken dishes.The cocktails were good too. The price was not super expensive considering the location. The employee who served us was super friendly and helpful. Overall, I recommend the place.",4,7/19/2022,Stillwater
184,"Friendly and timely serviceNice outdoor seatingAppreciated they have a non alcoholic beer optionGot a salad for dinner and the lettuce mix was fresh and tasty.But the food left something to be desired! I got fried chicken on the salad, and the chicken was bland and all breading. I scraped off some of the breading and could hardly find the chicken underneath.",3,7/20/2022,Stillwater
185,"Fat Man Reviews took a trip up north to visit Boston. While on the trip we stopped into Stillwater. Stillwater serves redefined comfort food with a full service bar and celebrity chef.We started with the Warm Burrata. This comes with baked Burrata Cheese in roasted tomato sauce with Basil Oil, served with Chef's Focaccia bread. The bread is toasted well, a little dry, it's almost like cornbread as it crumbles similar with a touch of sweetness, the Basil is pretty forward. The way the bread crumbles makes it hard to eat. The cheese is almost like fresh pulled mozzarella. The tomatoes are cooked well. Just a bit of course ground salt on the top puts it over the top in flavor. The tomato peel is still on when cooked and then falls off and rolls up, not pleasing to eat.I had the Pulled Pork Mac and Cheese, made with house smoked pork, ""the best"" mac & cheese and buttered Ritz cracker crumbs. The pulled pork is okay but kinda flavorless, a little fatty and slightly congealed. It could use a BBQ sauce to cut through the fattiness of the pork, unsure if it was smoked. The pasta is cooked and seasoned perfectly. The cheese sauce is good, maybe a little thin, which works for this dish. The biggest knock is in the plating as it is hard to get the cheese sauce in the bite because it settles to the bottom. The cracker adds crunch but if they were toasted, it would add another layer of depth to the flavor.My fiancé tried the Crispy Mozzarella Sandwich and fries, this comes with Mozzarella rolled in panko crumb, spinach, tomato, pumpkin seed, balsamic on a baguette. The Fries are house cut, fried well, but they need more salt. Mozzarella ball is a fried to a light golden brown but is very salty, spinach is nice kinda blanched or wilted. The baguette is great, fresh, chewy in the middle with great crunch. The balsamic is nowhere to be found, which would have been nice to cut through the saltiness.Stillwater offers a lunch and supper menu. They have several entrées, sandwich and salad or bowl options. The server was really nice. The Fat Man says that Stillwater is Fat Man Approved with 1 Chin.",3,8/10/2022,Stillwater
186,"Food was good but service was unfortunately lacking. I ordered the 421 and some mimosas for brunch, the dish would be nice to share but it's really heavy for just one person the pulled pork is pretty greasy. The mimosas were good but pretty small.",3,8/20/2022,Stillwater
187,"A weekend brunch brought me to Stillwater. At noon, the establishment quoted a 20 minute wait for my party of 5, which proved accurate. After taking a seat, I ordered for myself The 421 ($17) off the brunch menu, which arrived after ~10 minutes.The menu described The 421 as Crispy Tater Tots topped with Smoked BBQ pulled pork, two poached eggs, smothered with Hollandaise and a chili oil drizzle. The eggs arrived perfectly poached, oozing its yolk at the fork's touch. The pulled pork and Hollandaise created an extremely comforting, savory, and unhealthy palate that I washed down with equally unhealth tater tots. Admittedly, I could not taste the chili oil under all these flavors, but it did help make the Hollandaise not taste like straight mayo. 4*",4,8/25/2022,Stillwater
188,"Stumbled across this place while staying in the area and really enjoyed it. Vibrant atmosphere, great service (thanks Naomi) and delicious food. Had a really good espresso martini, great beer selection also. We shared a few starters and mains: Buttered biscuits (chicken butter mmmmmm ), poppy seed Ahi, brussel sprouts, smoked pulled pork Mac n cheese, muscles!",5,9/23/2022,Stillwater
189,"I have found my favorite mac & cheese in Boston after a year-ish of living here! Holy cow. For context, I ordered off of Ubereats from the ghost kitchen, called Mac Bar Boston. I'm basic & order the classic with a side of hand cut fries for $27. The cheesiness, noodles, and the ritz cracker crumbs were INCREDIBLE. I got full so fast between only eating half of the mac & the fries. Only giving 4 since I haven't been to Stillwater in person!",4,9/28/2022,Stillwater
190,"My wife, daughter and friends stopped by after the theater last Sunday.  They said it was excellent.  All of their dishes were fresh and delicious.  The service was quick and excellent.  Will be the go to place after the theater from now on.",5,10/4/2022,Stillwater
191,"What an amazing dining experience. Took some out of town colleagues here on a whim, very happy we chose this place! ALL of the staff were amazing, from the hosts to the bus staff. Our waiter, Brad, was exceptional. The Drinks, apps, and entrees were top notch. Those biscuits are something else! Get the chicken fried steak. You won't regret it. They are doing something right here!",5,10/4/2022,Stillwater
192,First time and it didn't disappoint. Started with the Tactical Turtleneck and it just kept getting better from there. Service was on point from start till the end! The Bronzini was cooked to perfection!,5,10/14/2022,Stillwater
193,"So glad we decided to come here! Ordered the scallop fritters, the veggie burger, and the apple crumble. All were delicious. Bonus points for the amazing music!!! Will definitely be coming back again.",5,10/15/2022,Stillwater
194,"A chill and pretty New American restaurant with some updated comfort food and cocktails. Great choice if you're in Boston on vacation or business though their hopping bar scene in front of house lets me know they're popular with the locals too ! Make reservations and get a table in the back of house. Super comfortable. The Noble Pursuit cocktail was the best one ! It was rum, prickly pear liqueur and hibiscus. Really different and nice. Slow Burn cocktail is mezcal and strong! Gin Blossoms cocktail was pretty peachy gin drink , pretty good. Tactical Turtleneck cocktail was a masculine bourbon and bitters cocktail if you like that kind of thing. Starters were the Homemade Cheese-it's and Dip.... interesting homemade crackers though I'm not sure it needed dip. Warm biscuits are a must order. Homey ! Deviled eggs were creamy looking. Main course of Kingston Bowl with salmon was a welcome lighter entree and tasty. My friend got the Ritz Chicken and thought it was tasty and substantial with a thick crust of Ritz crackers. Dessert was Chocolate Lava cake but there was no lava ! It was cooked all the way through so basically it's a brownie but still tastes good. Also, our server Brad was really great. He's extremely friendly and nice guy . All of the staff are nice . Dimly lit and relaxing place. Recommended. I would come back if I'm in Boston again.",5,10/27/2022,Stillwater
195,"Walked in and they had just finished there lunch rush so it was nice and quiet. I had just flew in from NYC and was starving. Ordered the hummus for appetizer & it was yummy, Friend ordered deviled eggs. We both ordered the veggie burger & to be honest it was SO BLAND. Didn't taste like anything at all, I still ate it because like I said I was starving and I also added avocado to it. (Didn't want my avocado to go to waste) I would definitely return due to the spectacular service we received. It pains me to have forgotten her name, she was great actually. Recommended the perfect drink for me, super sociable and pleasant to talk with. Enjoy",4,11/2/2022,Stillwater
196,Just a short walk from South Station -- A perfect place to grab a bite while waiting for your train. Quick and friendly service with a fun mix of American classics. Pulled pork mac and cheese was incredibly rich and creamy. The veggie burger could use a little texture and the fires were just alright.,3,11/13/2022,Stillwater
197,"Very nice lunch today for a work team.  The service was Friendly and efficient A couple of us had the Kingston Bowl salad - unique , delicious and fresh ingredients.  The dining room is bright and open with glass windows looking onto the city.  Recommend Stillwater!",4,11/15/2022,Stillwater
