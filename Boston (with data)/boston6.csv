0,"Had lunch there yesterday, and it was phenomenal. I sampled the avocado toast, the Mike's Hot Honey grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and the tomato mozzarella salad w/ Chicken.  Every item was a homerun. The Mike's Hot Honey grilled cheese might be the single best grilled cheese I've ever had.  I cant wait to go back and try some of the other sandwiches I saw.",5,8/31/2018,Vester
1,Got breakfast today for the first time after walking by the last few days. The outside is a little deceiving it doesn't scream cafe but I gave it a try. Got the iced mocha it was delicious. Then got the breakfast sandwich. Very good as well. I hope they keep up the good quality over time as they just opened so i had high expectations. Note to the owner: maybe you should put a chalkboard sign out front or something or have menus outside if I didn't google it I still would have no idea I could get good breakfast!,5,9/5/2018,Vester
2,"I came to Vester with high expectations - this was the coffee shop replacing the fabled Ames St. Deli after all. My immediate disappointment was the terrible coffee. My friend received a cold brew that tasted like water with bitter coffee grounds mixed in. I had the regular drip coffee, which was also quite watery but not particularly offensive. Unfortunately, the sandwiches we got were astounding in disappointment. Sampling the turkey sandwich and the chicken sandwich, the breads were dry and almost stale, the fillings were sparse and minimalist (you don't need to match the interior decor that closely), and were relatively expensive ($10+). Ultimately, the food and drink options we tried didn't seem mindful or inspired at all. I want Vester to succeed - we desperately need more good coffee and food places to come to Kendall. However, at this point in time, Vester is not firing on all cylinders and has no convincing identity (having been to Denmark, I see no resemblance of this place to any of their cafes apart from the decor). From a competition perspective, Vester will have a hard time seeing off Starbucks and Sebastians, which are almost adjacent. I hope they get their bearings soon and evolve quickly.",2,9/6/2018,Vester
3,Fresh tasty and on the marker Had breakfast Sandwiches on  a weekday Portions are not large but just tight Avocado toast is great Egg brioche sandwich is great Service is super friendly Liked everything about it,4,9/15/2018,Vester
4,"Gorgeous space, great drinks, and really tasty food.Finally, my dream for a nice coffee place that's also a pleasant place to study has been fulfilled. The owner is really nice and welcoming which gives it a really local and homey vibe. The drinks are tasty and they have oat milk, which is not that common in Boston. It even has really beautiful and healthy food, I ate an amazing avocado toast that was perfectly plated. Bonus: chairs that are comfortable.....with backs. The tables are large enough for laptops and a drink without fear of spilling and you can pick up broad internet so it's really the dream. It's also filled with natural light and a really pleasant and uplifting space.",5,9/15/2018,Vester
5,Great addition to Kendall. Coffee is smooth and the revival (1/2 cold brew 1/2 coconut water) is the bomb.,5,9/20/2018,Vester
6,"I've been waiting for this place to open for weeks, and it lived up to expectations! Came by on a Saturday to find it spacious and welcoming - the owner stopped by our table to chat and share a bit more about the background of the place. We were here for coffee and studying, and the drinks were super interesting, with a few specialty drinks that you wouldn't get anywhere else (the Hong Kong milk tea is amazing). Will definitely be back to try some of the food soon.",5,9/22/2018,Vester
7,"I've only had a few of the drinks at the location, including their specialty, the ""camo"" drink (espresso, matcha, and white chocolate). The drinks are quite decent, considering the prices are comparable to the place down the street. The first time I went there, the baristas were super sweet about informing me of how much sugar is in each drink, and happily answered my questions about some drinks I couldn't google.That being said, I would really give this place more of a 4 for technique, as I do agree that the drinks are not as technically refined as those of other cafes in Boston (the foam on a few of the lattes were not microfoam by any means---more of a froth with large bubbles). I do like their more interesting drink selection though, and for that, I give it a 5. I am also pretty biased and love matcha; they have a decent selection of those drinks to choose from.",5,9/24/2018,Vester
8,"tl;dr: cute cafe with a creative, reasonably-priced menu and great atmosphere/friendly staffI stopped by Vester last week, looking for a change from the Starbucks down the street and curious about this place that Yelp confirmed was new to the area. I was keeping my expectations low - I thought that it might be your typical hipster coffee shop that sells drinks that aren't worth the price, but I was really pleasantly surprised by the affordability and creativity in the menu. I will note that I haven't tried any food here, but the options do look surprisingly appealing and substantial for what seems to be a drink-focused place.As for the drinks, the menu is divided: there are coffee-based, espresso-based, and tea-based drinks - with some mixtures between the categories. For example, they have a Yinyang drink that's a mixture of coffee and milk tea, as well as their signature drink, the Camo, which is part espresso and part matcha with a little bit of white chocolate. I got the Camo when I went and it was fantastic! The matcha quality seems to be pretty high so it didn't get overwhelmed by the espresso, and the white chocolate addition made the drink just sweet enough without becoming a dessert, while picking up the flavor a bit from the bitter main components.I definitely plan on going back and doing my best to make my way through their menu, particularly their more creative options that I haven't seen elsewhere - which should take a little while since there are quite a few!",5,9/24/2018,Vester
9,"I have really mixed feelings about this place. I went for lunch, which may not be their strongest point. The positives: owner is incredible, super welcoming and knows her stuff. The food was good, and the coffee is also (good decaf is hard to find!). Prices are on par for the neighborhood. The negatives: food portions are small, at least for the salads. It's disappointing to get a to-go container that's usually for sides, with your lunch in it. Some of the staff seem great, but several others were wandering around and just looked at me blankly. Lastly, the design/layout is sort of weird, so I had awkward confusion when I got in- and the wandering employees were of no help.I'll give it another chance, probably for breakfast",4,9/27/2018,Vester
10,Great meeting Nicole and enjoying pours of wine! So glad to have found this place!And the delicious SpicedbChai Latte,5,9/28/2018,Vester
11,Taste the brownies! And the sandwiches are yummy too - especially the grilled cheese. A great new place! I'd go more often if I could find parking more easily,5,9/28/2018,Vester
12,"Great new addition to Cambridge! Atmosphere: Cute and trendy coffee shop/cafe, with a separate back room for if you want to get some work done or meet up with friends.Service: Friendly and attentive! I was able to score some free chocolate chip bread pudding during one of my visits.Food: Great selection of drinks and unique sandwiches. Prices are slightly expensive but comparable to other Cambridge cafes in the area, so it doesn't make a huge difference. I've tried their lattes and Turkey (sub Tempeh) sandwiches, which were both delicious! I also tried a sip of their Chai Latte, which I'm definitely going to get on my next visit. I'm excited to come back and explore more of their menu, especially their famed grilled cheese sandwich!",4,9/29/2018,Vester
13,"It took 45 minutes for our coffees to be delivered which requires only 30 seconds to be made.It's 10am on the Saturday morning, I invited two friends to this new place, since a friend told me it reopened just recently so I was expecting at least coffee of decent quality and service at lest slightly better than Starbucks. My friends and I ordered three coffees at the counter, they didn't tell us where and when to expect the coffee, and we proceed to sit on the side started chatting. During our conversation, I constantly kept an eye on the tables next to their kitchen wondering where I should pick up our coffee or if they will deliver. They kept producing sandwiches and coffees to other tables and people. ""Are they so busy? Were there so many people in front of us? Wait, those people were not there when we arrived why are their drinks delivered faster than ours? Oh were those Jude plain coffee so they are faster?"", I kept finding educases out of good wills for them but I couldn't deceive myself. After 20 mins, I walked up to them, the lady at the cashier out of three ladies in the kitchen noticed me after one minute, she answered it will come soon after I questioned the whereabouts of our coffee order. Then I went back to my seat assuming the three ladies are indeed busy preparing other people's ""more urgent needs"". Then the lady come back with two croissants and said sorry for the wait. Then I rest assured ""oh okay they must just have been too busy"" although everything is so weird. Another 25 minutes past by, I was getting upset. Then I walked up to the kitchen again, literally ready to complain. Finally the ladies in the kitchen all noticed me as they are no longer making sandwiches. The other two ladies asked the one at the counter who took our orders initially and asked what did they order. I was furious! They completely ignored our orders!!!! How could this happen when they fulfill other people's requests much more diligently!!!! After helping them locate our orders on their computers I went back to sit with my friends. They even came to my friends and ask what they ordered again! And they used only 30 seconds to make each one of our drinks and delivered it to us with a ""sorry"" and promise to refund the coffee to our credit cards (which I don't know if they have done that) . My friends came all the way from New York City and I indirectly invited them to such a bad experience. I really hated it and hated to confess that this is what my neighborhood has to offer. By the way, the coffee is okay and strong. But the water in the cup is kinda a little dirty with something inside.I felt so frustrated with this type of coffee stores existing in this neighborhood. They occupy a great location but deliver bad service and mediocre products. Such a shame. Just don't expect much from this place.",1,10/6/2018,Vester
14,"Oh Kendall Square, forever renovating, as if you can attract ever-more-innovative tech and biopharma businesses to the area through sheer force of will and tons of poured concrete / rebar.Vester has taken over the old Ames Street Deli space, and serves up interesting toasts, sammies, salads, as well as drinks. Having worked in Kendall when it was nothing but Sebastians, Mead Hall, and Starbucks, I suspect Vester will be a welcome addition to the neighborhood, one that has the added perk of being slightly more reasonably priced than its predecessor (Ames). I ordered a Vietnamese coffee ($3.74) after confirming it wouldn't be too cloyingly sweet and it came out quickly, maybe after 3 minutes max -- the woman who took my order also prepared it. It was the perfect temperature, not too sweet as promised, although I wish the coffee flavor were stronger; overall the drink was a tad watery. I do wonder if I had gotten it for here, whether they would have prepared it in the traditional manner -- condensed milk in a glass with a drip on top; that might have helped with the strength of the coffee.I didn't try the food menu nor did I linger but the space was buzzy but not crowded, and the food did look tempting. Overall, Vester is more convenient than barismo and cheaper than Beatnik, and I found the service friendly and attentive. If I'm in the area, I will be back, particularly to try the food.",4,10/10/2018,Vester
15,"The worst Americano... which tastes like water. Their signature camo is also just matcha but not great. Music is too noisy to chat or work. I would never recommend this place as well as the next restaurant, Dumpling Daughter.",1,10/19/2018,Vester
16,"A lovely addition to the MIT neighborhood and a good study spot! I've been here a couple times and tried a few drinks; they have a spiced chai latte that is very lightly sweet (unlike most), as well as some more esoteric options, like a hot honey latte and vietnamese coffee. Prices are reasonable. They also have food, and they are connected to Dumpling Daughter next door. The sister restaurants are owned by actual sisters! Looking forward to trying more stuff and happy to add this place to my rotation, which previously consisted mainly of Flour.",4,10/23/2018,Vester
17,"My favorite cafe in Cambridge. The cortado and camo drinks are amazing, some of my favorite most delicious drinks that blows any starbucks drink out of the water. I also love their fast, delicious breakfasts and baked goods. The avocado toast is amazing, and for $6 is the cheapest and most satisfying one you can find in the Kendall area.I'm glad we finally have something like this along with Intrepid near the mall, cafes like this counteract things like Starbucks and makes for a much more lively and less sterile place to live and work in.",5,10/28/2018,Vester
18,"Stumbled upon this place on my way to a job interview. I saw that it was a new place and had a cool cafe vibe. It shares space with Dumpling Daughter but they are pretty strict about sitting on the side you ordered from.  I got the Mikes Hot Honey Grilled Cheese + avocado. Wow wow wow SO GOOD. The bread was perfectly toasted and the mix of sweet and salty was fantastic. Seating is limited but they have lots of counter seating and a few tables with chairs. There is free WiFi and the staff is super friendly and can make recommendations or accommodate any changes to your order.On my second visit here, I got the Avocado Toast. It's lightly dressed with olive oil, sea salt, chives and lemon zest. It was another delish plate. I'm in serious trouble because I got the job and I think I'll be here a lot.",5,10/30/2018,Vester
19,The staff is always helpful and the store always looks clean and inviting.Parking is impossible but if you get lucky it's a great place to eat's and hang out.,4,11/11/2018,Vester
20,"A fantastic addition to Kendall Square, offering a variety of great salads, sandwiches, and drinks. Would in particular recommend the avocado toast and the Hong Kong milk tea plus Vietnamese coffee. Unique drinks not found elsewhere in the surrounding area. The aesthetic is charming as well, although it gets busy at lunch and may be difficult to do work at. Prices are fair. Overall: 5/5Value: 5/5 Food: 4.5/5Decor: 5/5",5,11/14/2018,Vester
21,"Tries to feel fancy but poor execution. Ordered an egg sandwich and a coffee today. Coffee was lukewarm and bitter, definitely sitting too long. Asked for my egg done hard, came out runny. Brioche was stale.",2,11/26/2018,Vester
22,"Best place. So cute inside, staff are welcoming and helpful. Food is incredible! Always adding new things. There is clearly passion behind this place. Prices are reasonable as well ($6 avo roast). Keep it up!!",5,11/28/2018,Vester
23,"Vester has a special place in my heart. I come here day in and day out because the food is inventive and fresh - a nice change from rest of the food in Kendall square. I've had nearly everything on the menu and here's a run down:1. Avocado toast - this right here is the epitome of avocado toast. The avocado is always fresh and ripe. The bread is perfectly toasted and warm. It is served with lemon rind and black salt with a touch of olive oil. It's flavorful with just the right amount of salt.2. Breakfast sandwich - this is an incredibly simple sandwich, but the egg is always perfectly runny and is balanced by a sharp cheese. The brioche is great to boot.3. Yogurt and granola - the yogurt is thick and creamy, and it comes with a huge amount of fresh fruit. The hot honey on top adds a great kick.4. Prosciutto sandwich- this is a large sandwich that comes on a fresh baguette with prosciutto, mozzarella, and a high quality balsamic drizzle. You'll basically have to go to Italy to get anything better.5. Turkey sandwich - turkey, bacon, avocado, pickles and ligonberry? Sounds weird, and I was skeptical at first, but it really is a great balance of flavors.6. Chicken sandwich - this is a chicken-salad-style sandwich served on a brioche. Not many people appreciate chicken salad, but this sandwich is always a solid choice. Comes on a brioche with sharp cheese that cuts the chicken salad well.7. Hot honey grilled cheese - this sandwich is as delicious as it sounds. Great mixture of saltiness from the cheese and sweetness from the honey and jam with just a touch of heat.8. Smoked salmon salad - this salad is my go to. It has three smoked salmon rosettes served on arugula with a sweet and tangy mustard dressing and pickled onions.9. Brussel sprout salad - What could be better than a large amount of chopped brussel sprouts with panko bread crumbs tossed in an avocado dressing? This salad is always filling.10. Kendall ceaser - bacon, romaine, ceaser dressing, and an inventive kick from everything bagel seasoning. Coffee is some of the best in Kendall square.The specials are also delicious. If you're feeling hungry, definitely grab the grilled cheese with overnight pot roast when it's on the menu. It will hit all of your dopamine receptors. Soups are always great as well.To top it all off, the owner is incredibly friendly and caring. Her love for her food and customers really shines.",5,11/29/2018,Vester
24,"This is a new cafe with limited vegan food options (just the avocado toast at the moment, and none of the pastries) and a bit more choice for vegetarians.  The drinks with milk can be made vegan with almond or soy milk, but the additional charge is very steep (+$1 for almond milk in a $3.50 matcha cortado is too much when soy milk at retail prices is below 5 cents per oz).  The drink was pretty OK, though, so still 3 stars.",3,12/11/2018,Vester
25,"My new go-to place for coffee!  Love the avocado toast, and the wine selection for a little treat after work is great too!",5,1/16/2019,Vester
26,"Great new spot - honestly the breakfast salad was the best thing I've had in a long time, as was the camo macha tea. Owner & staff are super friendly and attentive. Cool and classy, ambiance - fairly priced. 10/10 recommend - go try some Nordic dishes!",5,1/20/2019,Vester
27,"I used Vester Loyalty Punch card to collect points. I visited September 2018 with friends and collected 3 points in total. I visited Vester today again, and the lady said that they never used circle punch before and voided my previous points. This is really offensive. It seems that I cheated by punching the card by myself which I would never do! The three points are all by circle punches. If they never use circle punch, how comes even the first punch is circle? Communication within their team should be improved to avoid offending customers.",1,1/31/2019,Vester
28,"This place feels like a scam. On multiple occasions (3 for me & I have had multiple friends have similar experiences) Vester charges 1$ more than is listed on the menu. I have called up the place once pointing out the mistake and twice in person. The issue was not fixed months later. In fact EVERY time I have bought a food or drink here, the charge was too much. CHECK THE RECEIPT PEOPLE. This place is probably going to ask for more money than is listed on their menu.They seem to think they can get past this with a loophole that their ""physical"" menu is correct (which the cashier referenced, but when checked it it was also too low) but the big board menu (which I would estimate 80% of orders are from) is wrong in multiple places.  I just feel this is unacceptable. I understand a dollar isn't a big deal for a one time thing, but I can only imagine how many people everyday are paying over a dollar more than they should when they purchase something here. This should have been fixed immediately, yet the issue persists which makes me feel it's intentional to make a couple extra bucks off of many customers. The food however, is very good. Can't complain about that. But my whole experience has totally ruined this place for me. If I see this issue is still there in a couple months, I will be livid. Is this really is a mistake, I expect it to be fixed quickly.",2,2/14/2019,Vester
29,"Excellent weekday breakfast and lunch spot. Fantastic coffee, gets espressos and cappuccinos right, try the Camo with matcha and white chocolate. The sandwiches are soups great as well.The bad reviews are the typical petty grievances!",5,2/25/2019,Vester
30,"I came here before my doctor's appointment with hopes to have a quick bite and a delicious coffee. I ordered a cortado with oat milk and a kale salad (that comes with bacon). The salad was good- although I will say it was very basic which was surprising for this cafe. The cortado was delicious. I enjoyed the coffee quality a lot. I thought the cafe presentation was beautiful and the fancy idea to pour out glasses of waters for customers was thoughtful. The service was pleasant and friendly. I also did enjoy the interesting biotech conversations I was overheating near me. Since this cafe is right in the biotech center of Cambridge, this cafe is probably a regular hangout for workers and makes for a decent people watching spot haha I would come back here for a quick coffee and potential pastry if I was in the neighborhood. But, it is nothing I would go out of my way for.",4,3/2/2019,Vester
31,Such a nice and cozy Danish placeOat milk latte was so good. I ordered Avocado toast with smoked salmon. and my friend got Greek yogurt bowl with spicy warm honey and she liked it too. The only issue is the place is small and has limited seating.,5,3/14/2019,Vester
32,I've been coming to Vester ever since it opened and the coffee never disappoints. I had my first avocado toast here and have to say that it's definitely one of the best in the area. The bread is perfectly toasted and on top of the fresh avocado is a perfect blend of seasoning. It's also presented wonderfully with the perfect blend of colors.,5,3/27/2019,Vester
33,"The smoked salmon scrambled eggs toast and the oat milk steamer at Vester are both very delicious.  The toast is a good texture (the bread is sourced from Iggy's, which I like).  The scrambled eggs are soft (not rubbery like at some places) and topped with a sprinkle of Cyprus lava flake salt, which enhances the smoked salmon's flavor.  I thought this was quite a good touch to the dish.  Unsolicited suggestion: Perhaps also give customers an option to add a layer of fresh micro-greens between the smoked salmon and the scrambled eggs.  I could also see hot honey being drizzled on this (see below for additional discussion of hot honey). The oat milk steamer is quite different from other beverages I've had.  It has a bit of heat from the ""hot honey"" (spicy honey), which they also sell in the store.  This is a good, warming drink for spring, fall, or winter.  Unsolicited suggestion: Perhaps also give customers an option where toasted oats are whipped/emulsified in for added texture.     I went on a Saturday morning when it was quiet, and the owner prepared my dish and also took time to respond to my questions about the cafe: it's a place inspired by her travels and specifically by Danish food principles (fresh ingredients, locally sourced, and minimally processed).  The price is quite steep but not beyond what one would expect for the Kendall Square/MIT area and Boston/Cambridge generally.",5,3/30/2019,Vester
34,So I work right next door of Vester and I tried there food  Honestly I can say it's 5 out of 5 rate? They have a nice set up &  it's really nice to chill with your friends or coworkers?   The employees at vester's they are really  Friendly and awesome and they always smile.,5,4/26/2019,Vester
35,"If you enjoy FIKA in New York, then you'll probably find a place in your heart for Vester, also boasting Scandinavian roots. The cortado is my favorite in Cambridge other than at Curio, and the avocado toast with lemon zest is light yet refreshing.Not a huge fan of their HK milk tea, however, which was too foamy and lacked the thick sweetness of the traditional versions you can get in Chinatown (for a fraction of the price).",4,5/2/2019,Vester
36,Convenient location for coffee in Kendall. Good amount of seating available on a weekday afternoon.,5,5/16/2019,Vester

40,Love this place!!! Kendall Square is better because of Vester!!! Nicole and her staff are AMAZING and the food is yummy! Brownies are to die for!!,5,9/10/2019,Vester
41,"Stumbled upon this place while looking for a good place to do work near MIT, and was intrigued by the Scandinavian-inspired name/concept having lived in Denmark and Sweden. The place is incredibly spacious, and kinda shares a space with a dumpling shop (I believe both are owned by two sisters), which is an interesting concept. There are counter space type tables, as well as sit down tables. I imagine it would be a good place to sit down and catch up with a friend, but it can be a little noisy. Outlets are hard to come by, but the wifi is good and there is ample space to work. The menu has a variety of both food and drink offerings, not super Scandinavian really, but overall a nice find in the area.",4,9/18/2019,Vester
42,"Very open and trendy atmosphere. The Hong Kong milk tea is amazing! Just the perfect level of sweetness (aka not sweet, just enough to be not bitter). Actually the best milk tea I've had in boston, surprising that it's at this coffee shop and not a boba place! Lots of space to work, except the internet (they use the Broad's) can be iffy- sometimes it's great and sometimes it's insanely slow. I haven't been able to figure out if it's related to where in the cafe you're sitting. I had the granola and Greek yogurt which was delicious except I did not like the honey-- the idea of ""hot honey"" (spicy) is really cool except I didn't like the sriracha taste mixed with my yogurt and granola! Probably tastes better with their grilled cheese or some other savory dish.",4,10/13/2019,Vester
43,"Big fan of this place! Everything is tasty and fresh.  My favorites are the breakfast sandwiches, but the salads and smoked salmon items are also delicious.  Very hip and trendy in both their atmosphere and menu selections",5,10/15/2019,Vester

45,"Truly excellent and unpretentious stop for informal lunch and breakfast.  Their food is done on demand from high quality ingredients.  I love NY lox and breads, and the breakfast sandwich tastes as good as home with more variety embedded in it.  Go there before it gets too popular and changes.",5,12/6/2019,Vester
46,"I think one could study here, but the acoustics are very loud. It would be better suited for catching up with a friend (just one) since it's a small space. It's very chic space though and photographs very well. They serve cafe, wine and some small plates. A little pricey but the ambience and people watching is great",4,12/16/2019,Vester
47,"The food is delicious! One of the best place in Cambridge! Even though the food seems simple, but they have delicate flavors. Also they constantly add more seasonal options, which is great. The host is very knowledgeable about their wine selections. Good pair with the food",5,12/30/2019,Vester
48,"Beautiful and clean, prompt (but not overly chatty or friendly) service. Pretty empty on a weekday morning when I went in. Every single thing here is overpriced. I got the avocado toast, and, while flavorful and delicious was tiny (one small slice from a boule if you can imagine it) for the price and also on the saltier side. You're going to get a bigger serving literally anywhere. I also got the Hong Kong milk tea. I asked if it ""comes sweet"" and they said ""we can make it without sugar."" I said ""oh no I do want sugar"" but the milk tea that came out was also small, mildly sweet at best, kind of watery but also had a giant layer of foam on top. The place is small and while they bring your food out to you, they seem adamant about having customers pick up drinks. (There were 4 people working and only 4 patrons, so it wouldn't have been hard to walk drinks out to people?!) There are now way more options in the Kendall area than there used to be, and while it was an okay breakfast, I'd try somewhere else next time!",3,1/8/2020,Vester
49,"I continue to come here because it's so close to work. Today I came with 2 other friends to enjoy their happy hour, which is a glass of wine or beer with a free plate of mozzarella sticks. I got a glass of white (well I asked for red but I guess she didn't hear me?) and it came with two small mozzarella sticks. Each about the size of a finger, for a small hand. Overall still a good price for the area at about $9.50 per glass (with free app). Around 4:30pm it's not too busy, but started to get more busy around 5 or 5:15pm. There's a more extensive app list (including charcuterie board, nachos...) but none of that is up for grabs because the glass of wine comes with mozzarella sticks. And... so all 3 of us god mozzarella sticks. Even though a couple of us tried to 'trade in' for something that was equal or lesser value in apps, so we could at least try something else besides mozzarella sticks. The sticks were ok and nothing special. I heard they just started doing this special and I'm hoping they will expand to allow other 'free' app rotations so that a group of multiple people can experience an assortment, instead of... all the same dish :( Overall good experience, nice ambiance in the late afternoon after they cover up the glass windows with black drapes.",3,2/5/2020,Vester

The sandwiches are delicious, personally my fave is the Turkey Lingonberry! The Caesar salad is also great! And last but certainly not least... the desserts are AMAZINGGGG! The chocolate chip (or chunk) cookies are to die for, the brownies are also great! They also have made these rice crispy treats that are the best I've ever had!

54,"After months of grabbing Vester for lunch, I just now finally realized (while munching on their tuna melt) why their sandwiches spark so much joy for me. They griddle both sides of the bread -- inside and outside! So much crispy crunchy goodness. That's love.",5,8/7/2020,Vester
55,Very good sandwiches. The staff are very nice too. Price feels slightly high but not unreasonably so.,5,8/26/2020,Vester
56,"It's a cute, modern breakfast place with really good quality items. I think the blend of more western influenced food items along with an Asian drink menu (HK milk tea, Viet iced coffee, etc.) makes the experience even more fun and tasty! I got the beet+salmon smorrebrod and my friend got the lingonberry turkey. The ingredients were super fresh for both and the portion was surprisingly filling for what it seemed. The drinks were also done well and complemented the meal. The entire menu is a bit pricey, but it's understandable given their prime location and the quality of their ingredients. It's a good spot when you want to spend a bit more on nicer sandwiches, and it seems like a great study spot if restrictions for indoor dining are eased in the future.",4,10/20/2020,Vester
57,"The vibe of this place is spot on. As soon as I entered the space, I was greeted by friendly yet down-to-earth staff. The customer service is excellent, with quality food and beverages to back up the hospitality. I had the avocado and egg salad bowl, which was fresh, healthy, and filling. The new Vester at Home line is worth a try too. My favorite is the farro risotto!",5,3/18/2021,Vester
58,"This is a very special coffee shop in Kendall square and Cambridge. Vester cafe really feels like a community space even during Covid and they're committed to creating super tasty and fresh food to Kendall sq and the neighboring offices. Nicole, Cayla and the rest of the staff are so sweet. I feel very grateful to know them and am always rooting for their success. My fav things to order are the turkey + Brie sandwich, any of the toasts, the revival (such a great combo, and their general coffee selection. The new Vester@Home options have been super fun and tasty to try out too. These are frozen ready-made meals with quality ingredients that you can have for later. It shows how much care Nicole puts into her business. Support local business and go check them out !!",5,3/28/2021,Vester
59,Friendly staff and beautiful space. Latte is creamy and the egg waffle was the perfect combo of salty and sweet. Excited to try their sandwiches and seasonal drinks next time,5,3/31/2021,Vester
60,"Vester is amazing. Innovative and yummy food and drink combinations. Additionally the owner is super nice and everyone who works there has always been super friendly. It's one of my favorite coffee shops in Cambridge and Boston! The breakfast burrito, grilled cheese and eggo waffle sandwich is so good. Pre covid they would have a very yummy ""happy hour"" menu too!",5,4/20/2021,Vester
61,"overall, vester has really unique food and coffee but is definitely way overpriced for a college student's budget and although everything is really yummy, cannot justify coming here often price wise the avocado toast was really good and the lemon zest adds such a unique twist! my favorite part was the bread- it was sooo toasty and crispy. this is a bit nitpicky but I did think there was a bit too much oil soaked in the toast for my preferences such that I didn't feel amazing after. the lavender latte with oatmilk is also a must! I should've got the 16 ounce instead of the 20 ounce though since it was a bit heavy. the first sip was really heavenly, but drinking the whole thing was a bit much.overall though, definitely recommend for a try! just don't know if I will come here extremely often because of the price point :/",4,5/19/2021,Vester
62,Best grilled cheese I've ever had in my entire life. EVER.  (Added bacon and tomato.)  Just stumbled in while walking around the MIT campus....a real find!!,5,6/15/2021,Vester
63,"I've gone in before to grab an iced coffee but never tried their food until today. Eggo waffle sandwich smacks ‼ it's savory and sweet, great combination when you're craving something sweet but know you should be eating actual food. Don't forget a wet napkin to avoid feeling like a toddler.",5,10/21/2021,Vester
64,"The atmosphere in here is nice -- I just stopped by to grab a drink and a pastry. The raspberry streusel cookie was delicious, but I was really disappointed by the Hong Kong milk tea. I was excited to see that on the menu because I love Hong Kong-style milk tea, which is really strong tea with condensed milk. But be warned that it is not HK-style - it's just a very weak black tea latte, made with weak tea and regular milk. And I paid $8 for tea and a small cookie, so pretty expensive too, especially for all the grad students and underpaid research assistants who work around here.tl;dr good atmosphere and cookie, disappointing beverage and expensive",3,11/1/2021,Vester
65,"Everyone I know raves about Vester. I finally went and it was a HUGE letdown. The place was bustling for lunch. Long line & basically no seating. Service was fast & friendly tho.I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and I usually love chicken salad. But this one was soo disappointing. It was falling apart--I got mayo all over my hands :(. The chicken salad itself didn't have any flavor, but I liked the hot honey aioli. The bread was too toasted & didn't mesh well with the liquidy filling. The chips on the side were fine, nothing special. At $12 (they've upped their prices), the sandwich was pretty small and wayyyy overpriced. Go to Flour instead for filling & much tastier sandwiches.",2,12/3/2021,Vester
66,"Such a positive experience at Bester. Didn't realize how close it was to Kendall t stop which is great. But coffee was SO GOOD and breakfast sandwich was perfect. The space is cool, the employees were friendly... all in all, ideal coffee experience.",5,12/21/2021,Vester
67,"Vester never misses. I love their creative seasonal drink specials. The presentation, flavor and menu make this spot feel so classy. I keep coming back! Parking is tricky but Vester is super accessible via the T and the experience is well worth a little bit of parking hassle in my opinion! One of my favorite Cambridge spots, especially because it is not a chain! No hate to Flour, Tatte, and other local chains because I am a frequent flier at those spots too, but it just really makes my day to find independent spots. Even better when it's woman owned!",5,1/4/2022,Vester
68,WORST SERVICE. The workers are very rude they messed up my order and didn't even apologized and then they messed up on the size AGAIN. Finally got my drink after third try and then it tasted like they just diluted my small size with water. I just trashed my drink and NEVER going back.,1,2/12/2022,Vester
69,"There are a lot of things I enjoy about Vester, but some things really detract from its appeal and make me hesitant to come. Some good things: I love the coffee and other drinks, there are lots of unique options and nondairy milks! The cookie butter latte always hits the spot, and I always get so excited to try their other seasonal flavors too because they sound so interesting and yummy. The HK milk tea was the only one I have tried so far and didn't love, somehow tasted simultaneously watered down and very bitter (and I say this as a black coffee drinker). The foods are equally as unique as the drinks, and I have liked all of them that I have tried. The Brussels + Brie sandwich sounded like an odd concept to me when I first saw it (a salad in a baguette?) but I personally love it! I would also recommend the Turkey + Brie sandwich, some of my favorite ingredients (bacon/arugala/brie/fig jam) all in one! The yummy homemade chips come on the side with every sandwich or wrap, and I love the sandwiches on either bread; the baguettes are so crunchy and delectable, and the sourdough is flavorful, lightly toasted, and fresh. The interior is an aesthetic and comfortable atmosphere, the service is efficient and friendly, and it is always bustling and a popular spot.The not so good:The main problem is that Vester is quite overpriced, and especially given that, the portions are small and really stingy on ingredients. They put sooo little brie in the sandwiches-I love brie as you can tell from my sandwich recommendations above :(( but they do a deceptive thing where they put pieces of the brie on the exposed ends of the sandwich but literally *none* in the middle, so it appears as if there is more when there is in fact very little. They also don't actually have their own wifi-they will tell you to connect to the Broad Institute's free wifi, though I will say this hasn't been much of an issue for me as I have done work here for hours without issue. If you want something that is reasonably priced for what you get, I wouldn't recommend coming here.Despite these shortcomings (and unfortunately for my wallet), I will probably continue to come occasionally when I'm in the mood for a quick sandwich or to try their unique seasonal drinks.",3,2/16/2022,Vester
70,"This was my first visit to Vester and I'm so glad I went! A small space w yummy food -- looking forward to coming back and sampling more of the menu. I appreciate that this is a woman- and POC-owned business too! My partner and I ordered the following for Saturday lunch takeout: turkey and brie sandwich, truffle turkey club sandwich, ube rice krispy treat, and iced Hong Kong milk tea w lavender --TASTE: 4/5 - I really enjoyed my sandwich; you can't go wrong w a bacon-brie-fig jam combo! And the milk tea w lavender was perfect, I could definitely see myself getting this regularly. I do wish that the truffle flavor came through more in the club sandwich, along w the ube in the rice krispy treat TEXTURE: 4/5 - the sourdough bread and potato crisps had a nice crunch!PRICE: 3/5 - I expected the sandwiches to run closer to $10-12SERVING SIZE: 3/5 - satisfactory size for lunch, but wish we had more!SERVICE: 4/5 - the woman at the register was helpful and attentive, and our order came out in about ten minutesATMOSPHERE: 4/5 - the decor is simple and classy w Scandi vibes (side note: looking forward to the shared space, Dumpling Daughter, opening too!)PARKING: 4/5 - several metered spots were available, and we snagged one on the next block",4,3/26/2022,Vester
71,"Sad that this was underwhelming. Hoping it was an off day bc the menu concepts and ideas are so good. Execution is where the downfall is. Drinks: The iced ube Hong Kong milk tea was good! We enjoyed that with whole milk. Would have loved a bit more ube taste. We also tried the iced Fruit Pebble Matcha with oat milk and that tasted like literal cereal water. I wish the matcha was stronger bc I felt like I couldn't taste it at all, my gf said she tasted a hint.Food: We tried the Brussel salad sandwich which was actually pretty good! Dressing was flavorful. Interesting concept but actually a lot better than we imagined. We also had the prosciutto di Parma which would have been delish but the construction of the sandwich felt careless. Mozzarella chunks were unevenly cut and shoved in between balls of prosciutto and randomly sliced tomato. The glaze was so good and I wanted more of it but there was only glaze on the top. Eating it as a sandwich meant taking bites of bread and only tomato or bread and only prosciutto. I ended up taking it apart and layering it myself. The bread was the star for the sandwiches. Crisp and fresh baguettes! Both sandwiches came with homemade chips. I also got the ube Rice Krispie. When I asked about it, the girl behind the register said it was an ube Coconut Rice Krispie which sounded delish but when I received it it was actually not coconut but Oreo topped. It was fine. It was soft but tasted like a regular home made Krispie. Barely picked up on the ube. Overall, ingredients were fresh and good quality but it is pricey.",2,3/27/2022,Vester
72,"My first time here and when I saw the food choices on the menu they all looked very delicious. The croissant I got was very fluffy, light and delicious. We got a vanilla and lavender latte and they were both very delicious. I would definitely come back for the coffee. However, I think the prices were very overpriced",3,4/12/2022,Vester
73,"Small biz done so well it's like you're at your own home! If I could make homemade chips and the best brownie or chocolate chip cookie I have ever had... Thankfully I found Vester! Ran errands and needed lunch quick! A friend recommended Vester so I stopped in and their menu offers so many items, a mix of salads, sandwiches, even soup they change depending on the season!Cayla was so friendly and helped a girl out! I got the best selling grilled cheese you can customize (def get the hot honey!) and with the chips and a lavender latte to go, I was one happy girl!I can't wait to go back for a post work happy hour and try some of the new items on the menu they offer like the ""walking taco."" I'm so impressed by how diverse the menu is, and you can taste just how wholesome the food is you're eating. That's so important. You may be shopping small but it is so much value for what you're getting and the vibe in the cafe is so fun! Def will be back! Vester does it Best!",5,5/9/2022,Vester
74,"A nice coffee shop in Kendall with some decent food options! Came here for a quick brunch on a weekend and it wasn't too crowded - they have a few menus at the front including one for drinks, sandwiches, and some pastries by the counter. I ordered a strawberry matcha cloud and a caprese sandwhich. The matcha drink was good, though the strawberry foam reminded me of strawberry yogurt flavor (would have been nice if it were more fresh). The sandwhich was great too but perhaps had a little too much balsamic dressing (to the point of making it a little too sour). Service was friendly and efficient!",4,5/24/2022,Vester
75,"There was a hair on my chips (see pic) :(I feel like this place will eat your wallet before you get a chance to fill your stomach-- it is quite pricey.I tried the turkey and brie sandwich ($14) which was pretty sweet overall due to the fig jam. The sourdough bread was toasted and crispy on the outside but a little greasy. As I mentioned above, the homemade chips on the side are so homemade that they cooked a hair into them...I also got to try the croque madame ($14). This sandwich was also on toasted sourdough bread with a super melty, smoky, cheesy inside.The iced matcha latte ($4.50 small) was pretty standard and tasty. Prepare to pay an extra $1 for oatmilk!I liked both sandwiches but felt that I could be receiving something of better quality (less grease, less hair) for the price.",3,5/26/2022,Vester
76,"I am writing this Yelp review while eating my breakfast sandwich at Vester. I work nearby so I like stopping in occasionally for a latte or a pastry when I don't want to go to packed Starbucks next door or any of the other places in the area. Vester is usually full of professionals and college students having meetings, but I appreciate the chill vibes and the music. Most all of the staff are friendly. The only time I encountered a rude person was one of the baristas, she was quite cold and not helpful. Additionally, as someone who likes to keep to myself while sitting in a cafe, I don't like the large communal style tables, it creates awkwardness when the cafe is busy. I understand it encourages meeting new people and Vester shares space with its sister restaurant next door, but I wish I could find a seat early in the morning when the nook next to the door wasn't even set up yet. The tables were still stacked when I walked in. So expect to not bring  your heavy work bag plus all of your reusable shopping bags, space is a little limited if you're planning to work on your laptop or study here.Now to coffee and food! I have tried their chicken salad sandwich, brioche breakfast sandwich, the breakfast burrito and various pastries. I love good cafe food. The chicken salad sandwich is worth trying, it's slightly sweet from the raisins and serve on buttery bread with house made chips. I'd also recommend the brioche sandwich, you can customize it with the style of eggs and meat if you want. Over all though, sometimes the food leaves some to be desired, they go heavy on the butter which is a good thing if you love butter! But for the price, I'd prefer other cafes in the area if I'm going to spend over $5 on a sandwich in the morning.Pastries are always good, they have some original ones like Rice Krispies! I think they come from a local bakery which I enjoy. Coffee.. sadly, part of the reason I rated Vester three stars was the coffee quality. For such a cute place with a great concept, the quality of their coffee makes me disappointed. I'll give them credit for their Asian influenced beverages! You can't find that at Blue bottle or Starbucks. It truly speaks to the creativity of the cafe's owner. The Vietnamese iced coffee isn't the rich and concentrated espresso flavor I know and love, instead I think they made it from iced coffee with condensed milk. The lattes are a solid choice. The iced coffee is.. probably some of the worst. My cup of iced coffee probably came from a fresh batch of coffee but unfortunately it's very watered down in flavor.",3,5/27/2022,Vester
77,"Super cute cafe, great for a quick bite in the morning! The coffee tastes pretty similar to Starbucks, but the iced lavender latte was probably the highlight of my meal. I also got the truffle turkey club which was delicious, but the sauce tends to seep out of the holes in the bread. Overall a good ambience, but nothing mind-blowing!!",4,7/9/2022,Vester
78,Loved the drinks! I had the smoked salmon toast and the eggs were over cooked for my taste. The menu had great options for unique drinks so still worth checking out.,4,7/15/2022,Vester
79,"It was ""fine"". Got the avocado toast which had a yummy lemon zest but the bread was too hard/crunchy to be enjoyable. I added smoked salmon and got a laughably small amount so don't bother adding / paying for that. I tried the mozzarella and tomato salad which was drowning in arugula - so I recommend it if you love arugula.",3,7/20/2022,Vester
80,"Cafe is super cute.Service is good.Drinks look cute but aren't good.Coffee IS NOT good. They had to remake mine 3 times and it still wasn't good. The cookies here are amazing!Food isn't great, better off getting it somewhere else. Also read your signs when you come to this place. For more of the conservative folks, this isn't the place to put your money. When I was there, some of my money from the things I bought proceeds to those women who need an abortion. So basically funding an abortion.",2,8/8/2022,Vester
81,"They just dropped a new pumpkin latte, and it tastes amazing. I would highly tout their customer service. I got the chance to strike up a conversation with some of them, and I could tell how much they cared for the service of their customers.

I will be coming back to try more of the drinks and menu items.",5,9/21/2022,Vester

85,This sandwich was deliciousssssIt's usually made with brioche but they ran out so I got it on a croissant. The cheese was perfectly melty and the egg perfectly runny. The slightly sweet matcha latte was a perfect balance to the salty sandwich. Would go again!,5,11/12/2022,Vester

87,Staff are so accommodating and fun to play with! Mysterium was our first game and was a thoroughly enjoyable experience! Tots were missing during the soft opening but the pretzel bites and coffee were all I needed,5,11/24/2019,Tavern of Tales
88,"Went there during their soft opening! Staff are super friendly and they guided us through games. The music effects are also so good. Overall a great experience at ToT, and certainly will come back again!",5,12/3/2019,Tavern of Tales
89,"Wow I did not know I needed this in my life!! The games here are so entertaining and the sound effects pair up perfectly! I highly recommend playing Mysterium (for the spooky crowd), Resistance (competitive), and Tokaido (relaxing). Clearly, I am in love with all of their games and recommend coming to try them yourself! Also side note, the game masters are amazing! I love how I don't need to spend 30 + minutes just learning how to play the game and can just dive right in. The loaded tots are also scrumptious as well as the cocktails! What's not to love?",5,12/9/2019,Tavern of Tales
90,"Definitely recommend TOT if you're looking for something different and wholesome with a group of friends! The concept here is really cool. There's a cafe / waiting room outside where you can buy food (of course there are tots available, ha ha) and drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic). The place was quite empty which surprised me. But super clean, new, and modern!You reserve your game beforehand on Resy (we reserved the game Tokaido for 4 people on a Sunday afternoon). When our group all arrived, we headed into a small game room (looks like a conference room, but with a game table set up!). You can take food/drinks in the game room and order them there as well. I was impressed with how the game was set up perfectly already with even an interactive soundboard in place. Our game host Ben was fantastic at explaining the game (they're all trained to do their job well) and also incredibly patient dealing with our long decision-making periods and terrible jokes. The gameplay itself was cute, fun, engaging, and competitive. I'll definitely come back for another game sesh next time I visit Boston! This is a totally fun activity for the days you're tired of going out to a random bar and no one wants to host at their apartment.",5,12/16/2019,Tavern of Tales
91,"I thoroughly enjoyed Tavern of Tales's unconventional take on the board game cafe experience. The guided gameplay experience means even casual players like myself can jump right in, and the sound effects and narratives add considerably to each game's atmosphere. My favorite parts are when the sounds and narration directly tie in with specific actions you make because it makes each decision feel more consequential.Whereas other cafes provide an almost overwhelmingly large game selection which makes can give you analysis paralysis, Tavern of Tales has a tightly curated list of sound-enhanced experiences for their private rooms. Even if you don't make a reservation and just want to hang out, there are other games like Jenga and Uno that you and your friends can play without a game master or effects. Each of the sound-enhanced board games is easy to learn in a few minutes, fun for all skill levels, and accompanied by cool sound effects, narration, and/or music.The sound-enhanced games are run by game masters who handle setup, explaining the instructions, managing some background elements of the game, triggering sound effects, and keeping things organized in general. Basically they take all the hassle and potential confusion out of games so that I didn't need to think about anything else other than the game itself. All of our game masters were friendly, helpful, and made sure every game we played was consistently enjoyable from start to finish.It gets busy during the weekends especially, so reservations are advised to make sure you get a spot at your desired time. There's free wifi and discounts for groups of five. They also have small bites and drinks like coffee, tea, beer, and board-game-themed cocktails. The vibe is relaxed -- unless you bring your hyper-competitive friends and try to beat every game on the highest difficulty. I highly recommend Mysterium for a co-op group puzzle-solving experience, or Tokaido if you enjoy a friendly competition.",5,12/16/2019,Tavern of Tales
92,"Really fun place! I love the concept of having a game master. The immersive sound experience is super cool too! I reserved a room for 2 for Tokaido and had so much fun playing. I've seen the game in board game cafes before, but was intimidated by how complicated it looked. Not a problem here! You can also bring in drinks/food from the bar, just in case you needed something to nibble on. The cocktails we tried were super good! So much love for this place. I definitely want to come back with more people!",5,12/26/2019,Tavern of Tales
93,"Tavern of Tales was a blast! Staff are all super friendly, prompt service, and the game room experience is one of a kind. I went with 3 others and we played two hours of games. Pricing is very reasonable. This place is for everyone! If you don't want to play in a game room with a game master you can always hang near the bar and play card or board games there. I'll be back!",5,1/30/2020,Tavern of Tales

95,"A relatively new and unique establishment. They offer a limited bar, do to their category of a cordial bar. Their main attraction is the games they play. This is similar to the establishments that offer escape rooms. This one though has game rooms which you go in and you can either play against each other or play with each other to solve whatever the game is. We decided to do a murder mystery and out of the three of us, we all made final level but only one of us actually completed the final level. A member of their staff sits in the room with you and operates the game and sometimes offers game hints. This is a new concept and opened only a few months ago. If your looking for something different to do, you should give this a try. It may not be for everybody but a good time for those that like a little bit of competition.They only offer street parking.",3,2/9/2020,Tavern of Tales
96,"I have been to Tavern two times with friends. The first time, we hung out in the bar area and played some games. Staff are great, very attentive and willing to explain rules. The second time, I dropped by for the St Patrick's Day event. We were able to try out Mysterium and Forbidden Island (both cooperative but they have competitive options for people who are less bitter than I am about losing) for free in the game rooms, as well as participate in the raffle. Completely loved the experience and can't wait to come back after this coronavirus situation subsides. Drinks are decent. Really like the Flower Child beer and the ice coffee is solid.

Unfortunately, it was pretty mediocre. Our sandwiches plus one beer was around $20 which was a great deal but I wouldn't pay full price for this.

105,"I had just left a speaking engagement at Simmons College where one of our Congresswoman were in attendance. The feeling I had after the special occasion was an exuberance filled with hopeful bliss. I wanted to walk up to the main street of Tremont to catch a Lyft ride but needed a warm place to wait for 15 minutes. I bypassed about 5 other places to finally look at Tavern of Tales and say ""Ok this place looks warm, inviting,people are eating and sitting. I knew maybe I couldn't sit so I would buy tea or drink so I could patronize the restaurant and not make it a rest stop.I had a few things in my hand and took my mask off during the walk from Simmons. As I attempted to open the Door to Tavern the guy ""Tim"" allegedly a POC. I try not to use that word for everyone who is non-white because I am an Obvious person of color who faces the blatant discrimination, so I do not use POC for beneficial reasons.. but Tim gave me a look like I had the plague, so I assured him I have a Mask and will be putting it on before entering . So after I am locating my mask, a group of Caucasian Males came behind me a party of 5? And entered with no mask and a warm welcome. So I said to myself ""hmmm"" okLet me just put on mine because the majority do have visible mask, minus one of the workers. Well I didn't get a welcome like EVERYONE else after me but I told ""Tim"" I will sit at the bar and I am alone.. Tim rolls eyes, maybe he has allergies? But I sit down and he ask me what I wanted to order or drink  not in a friendly tone. So I ordered tea.  Let's flash fwd . I was asking questions about the establishment and met with one worded answers and an attitude like I was annoying them. So I got up to walk to the side to peak and see how big the place is as my tea steeped.  TIM  yelled ""LOOK IF YOU ARE GOING TO WALK AROUND YOU NEED TO PUT A MASK ON! Yes he yelled it, instead of calling me back to the bar.Where I walked was 4 steps from my seat. Everyone in turn looked at me.. so I sat down and I said, what about the worker who is walking around with no mask? He said I will address it when I see him, I said he was just in your face? But I let it go Then ""Mark"" another worker came up on the side of me to pick up an order for the private room in the back, I tried to engage Mark as he sat there waiting for something asking him about the Tavern of Tales and how big is the place and how to book the game room..he was rolling his eyes, Bobbing his head, and moving his hands like ""Just Google it"" why ask me? Then I got silent after his actions and we had an awkward 1 minute of blatant looking at each other in the eyes . I was so happy when My Lyft cameI feel so horrible in this place, it was icy, and I FELT LIKE I WAS NOT WANTED OR WELCOMED AND THEY HAD NO PROBLEM WITH IT, THEY DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO ACT OR PLAY IT OFF .I was so shaken I told my Lyft driver who happened to be a Dark Brown person like me, we cried and swapped stories of past experiences and How racism is not Over .it is only over to people who do not look like us or go through the experience..Tim is Asian and considered a POC but I didn't expect him to treat me any different but I would hope that he would know that he doesn't have the POWER OR PRIVILEGE to act the way he acted towards me. This is why I am very careful with the whole we all ARE POC and face the same things ..NOT TRUE! There are levels to this but that is a whole other topic. They treated me mean, the other patrons were chilling but the guy who was two seats down from me, I know he felt awkward and he felt the atmosphere by the way he kept looking at me..It is a shame in 2021 that Brown People still can't walk in a restaurant in Massachusetts in a community that is diverse and be  Welcomed..I will never go back there.  Thank you Tim and MarkYes this Tavern does have Tales!",1,11/21/2021,Tavern of Tales

107,"This is my new favorite place to go out. Even with just me and my partner we still had a lot of fun with our game experience, and our game master made it super easy to understand the rules. He even explained another game we played afterwards on our own. There's a great selection of games to play and the food and beer are just icing on the cake. Definitely a must visit for anyone who loves board games or wants to try something new.",5,2/8/2022,Tavern of Tales
108,Amazing place! THE best place to host game night or a DND session in all of Boston. Food is great and the drinks are always creative (they also have some of the best coffee in the are),5,3/21/2022,Tavern of Tales
109,"Ate once. Paninis were fine. After serving and putting my life on the line, I was denied access. Previously I've been a combat medic, in Afghanistan, Iraq and I just returned from the Ukraine. All I wanted was a quick drink. Wouldn't disturb anyone. I wasn't allowed at the door, found another establishment which served me politely. Very unprofessional. Only reason for two stars is because they know how to make a basic overpriced panini.",2,6/15/2022,Tavern of Tales
110,"Reserved a private room for our group, it was awesome, the employees were super accommodating and knowledgeable on the games. Great food and drinks. 100% will be back.",5,7/17/2022,Tavern of Tales
111,"Such a neat spot, where you can play board games, drink, and eat snacks! The vibes were great, and our waitress was very warm and personable. The Parmesan pretzels and cheese dip were to die for, and we highly recommend it! Unfortunately, the Turkey sandwich was left to be desired. -- The bacon was burnt, and the presentation was just sloppy. I know it's not a high end establishment, but for something that is overpriced, the sandwich could be well put together at the very least. It really didn't have to look the way it did. Anyway, we had a good time, and I will certainly come back again!",4,9/24/2022,Tavern of Tales
112,"Came here after work one Thursday with a friend and had such a fun time! I had passed this place many times and had been wanting to check it out for a while. The vibe of the place is so chill and fun. Loved all the variety of games you could play! They also had private game rooms that it looked like you could reserve. Food was great bar food! They had a good selection of small bites and sandwiches. We shared the garlic and parm pretzel bites and they were SO delicious. Highly recommend. We also split the turkey sandwich and enjoyed that as well. With both, you really can't go wrong. I will definitely come back here. Great spot to come for drinks with friends and I love that they provide something to do as well!",4,10/15/2022,Tavern of Tales
113,"Fun atmosphere, Great Food! A lot of fun! The board game selection was amazing. I enjoyed the Zoom Meeting coffee drink,  it was a great start to my morning!",5,10/30/2022,Tavern of Tales
114,"A group of 3 of us went here tonight for a good time. I liked the board game selection and they had a local beer on tap that I enjoyed. The food was alright! We got the tomato soup, flatbread pizza, and pretzel bites. While the food was good, we were a little put off by little things we wanted that they didn't have. The only whiskey they offer is jim beam honey... ew. They only have three beers on tap, and they don't have a lot of food options. The pretzel bites needed yellow mustard and they didn't have any. Just honey mustard! Everything was more or less reasonably priced... service was inattentive and hard to flag down. We played one game and left for somewhere with a bigger selection of drinks.",3,11/4/2022,Tavern of Tales
115,"Back in Boston and heard they also have morning cafe and breakfast sandwich & pastry service. They are featuring George Howell coffee and hand poured! When we were there on a Tuesday morning few tables were already occupied by working professionals. Heard from the staffs that weekends are popular with local residents and students living nearby coming to study. Love the soft music and ambiance, friendly staff, high speed internet, great coffee and food! Have to come back for the bar service!",5,11/8/2022,Tavern of Tales
116,Cute spot! Just opened recently so service is slow. They  may need to hire more staff. We got the chargrillled oysters and hot buttered lobster roll. Wish the cheese was more melted on the oysters but they were tasty. Would get the oysters again as it went great with the sav blanc. We waited a while for the food and our wine came after the food. Hoping service will run more smoothly soon.,4,5/21/2021,The Pearl
117,"Excellent gem added to the community. I have been looking forward to the opening of the gem. Now for the fun. The seafood was so fresh, this staple does an amazing job of not overpowering the seafood with a bunch of salt. Everything was flavored to perfection. I can't wait to god back and enjoy some other things on the menu. -This visit included:Grill oysters Spicy crab dipCrab cakeShrimp scampi The best clam pasta with white clam sauce. Everything was AMAZING!",5,5/22/2021,The Pearl
118,"I are there on Thursday, the food was amazing the drinks were on point and I'm going back as soon as possible. We sat outside and enjoyed the weather as it changed which had no effect on the service. The Pearl is a new treat to Boston's great restaurant family and its right in South Bay.",5,5/30/2021,The Pearl
119,We are so excited to have this open up in the South Bay! We went for dinner and had amazing drinks and food. For drinks we first had the pistachio martini and the spicy margarita. Then for our main course we had a warm lobster roll with cab sav and my boyfriend has a burger with beer. They were both so delicious I highly recommend!,5,6/4/2021,The Pearl
120,"Visited last night with my wife and the ambiance, service, food, and drinks were all on point. I highly recommend the artfully presented calamari and the generous chilled lobster roll as well as the cocktails. We sat in the outdoor lounge, which at other restaurants can make you second class to everyone inside, but our server Jocelyn was super attentive and the lounge was comfy and pleasant. PS. Mayor Kim Janey also dropped by for a repeat visit, so I'm guessing she's fond of the pearl as well?",5,6/10/2021,The Pearl
121,"New HOT SPOT in city and already the talk of the town. Several people told me about this place, so I had to check it out. The experience was EXCELLENT! Food was tasty and fresh! The Pearl Potion Cocktail is perfect with any of the items on the menu. Had the right type of atmosphere with music to vibe too. Perfect for a night on the town or a date. The cherry on top is the establishment is blacked owned! I suggest everyone check it out! You will not be disappointed.",5,6/13/2021,The Pearl
122,"Wait staff was very nasty, not cheerful. She seemed aggravated. Food was not too good. Expected better. Orders were being mixed up. The atmosphere was definitely not friendly.the drink pistachio martini was good , water was cold and good. When we asked for additional silverware and glass waitress seemed to be upset as we were asking for money! Oysters were good. Shrimp, bacon risotto too salty. Calamari was ok. Not excited about the seating. I made reservations almost 2 weeks ago. It was my birthday. Another table had a complaint about the wait staff and order being mixed up. Host were ok , they were not concerned because we weren't pleased with things. I hope the owners look at these reviews and understand, if you know better you do better. Better training and communication professionalism from the waitress Jocelyn",3,6/22/2021,The Pearl
123,"This establishment has really done a superb job. My friend and I sat outside on the front patio which was lovely and had plenty of heat lamps to keep us warm. The hostess was so warm and welcoming. Our waitress was a sweetheart, very attentive, and made sure we were happy. I had the pistachio martini which was incredible. We split the chargrilled oysters as well as the lobster Mac and cheese and shrimp scampi. All were so incredibly done. Really great to have this place in the neighborhood, we will definitely be back soon to try the rest of the menu!!",5,6/23/2021,The Pearl
124,"I was really hoping to love this restaurant and make it a regular spot for local dining. We dined here Father's Day weekend. Sat early enough where there were only three other tables (two two-tops and one three-top). Perhaps more training is needed, the server was not attentive. The server was not aware which items from the menu were available for order aside from Brunch. There was no water, it took a long time to get one straw (we were seated next to the bar), and she never checked in on us during our meal. There was another woman who dropped off our food. While our server herself was friendly this other woman didn't say hello, didn't crack a smile, and seemed annoyed when dropping off our food. A gentleman (he was nice) approached our table at the end of the meal to talk about corking yet we never ordered wine. The pistachio martini was good, a fun one to try. The espresso martini was not bad. The $65 Ruby (Local Oysters,  Shrimp Cocktail, Cherrystones) could have been much better for the market price. For $10 more than the price we paid here we had a bigger and tastier raw bar platter the next day at another seafood restaurant. We were very disappointed with the raw bar platter. The Seafood Newburg & Cheese Grits had maybe 1 small piece of lobster and 2 pieces of shrimp. We don't mind paying for good food but we felt this was a plate of mostly cheese grits. The salmon hash was okay but came out medium-cold temperature. Overall, the service and food experience could have been better.",2,6/25/2021,The Pearl
125,"1st class seafood, cocktails, and ambiance in the bustling new South Bay development. Easy parking. Owned by a local restaurant owner from Roxbury/Dorchester area. Definitely recommend! Support this local business!",5,6/25/2021,The Pearl
126,"Arrived tonight for my 6:30 reservation -- wasn't seated until 7. I understand there was a storm outside and it moved people indoors, but we were stuck either waiting in the small/busy front area or go outside in the rain. Everyone seemed untrained but we're patient because they're new. Food was ok -- had the pan seared scallops. Scallops were really over cooked and the risotto was beyond meh & salty. Overall lack of customer service really ruined the experience for me. Not rushing back.",3,6/30/2021,The Pearl
127,"This is what Boston needed! I don't even know where to start, LORDT. This place was bomb.com - the food, drinks, the bartenders, the waiters, the host, the owner, the vibes. Wow! Everything I ate and drank was delicious. And listen, I ate a lot. Something about being in a space with beautiful Black people also did it for me. I love how this place also employed Black folks. It reminded me of Angela Davis' reminder to ""...lift as we climb..."" because we have a responsibility to each other. I know this is about food and drinks, but I'm just so proud of these owners!  Feeding us AMAZING food. Giving us a place to laugh & enjoy each other's company over AMAZING drinks. I'm wishing the owners many more years of successful business - generations down the line. I'll bring my daughter here in 18 years so she can enjoy the beauty of Black food, Black business, and Black joy :)Cheers",5,7/11/2021,The Pearl

130,"I've been to The Pearl twice. The first time, my friend and I had reservations for 4pm. We arrived a bit after 4 and they were still setting up for the evening which was a little annoying. The service that first time we went was also not the best but it was exponentially better the second time I went. They also don't seat folks until the whole party arrives so be aware of that.The food was great. The chargrilled oysters are delicious, as was the lobster alla vodka and the thai curry mussels although the crostini was not my favorite for the mussels. The 20B Knees was a great cocktail. Delicious over all. Happy to have another Black owned establishment in Boston!",5,7/25/2021,The Pearl
131,"First off clean place nice set up, I understand after COVID hit things got rough, we got there didn't get drinks until AFTER we finished eating which to me was crazy and a big no no, the food was good not great which what the prices were priced at, wine poorly served with so little in the Glass it was like why even bother, again for drinks to come out after the food is a big no no, the oysters to me were tiny I eat duxbury oysters everywhere and these were tiny and to be a so called oyster bar I was let down, besides not having anything major on the menu except for lobster or king crab was king of disappointing also, maybe we will try this place again but the waiters and bar tenders need to be updated, especially the bar tender if people aren't getting nice THEY NOT GONNA HAVE FUN!",3,7/30/2021,The Pearl
132,"Music-perfect type and volume,Bathrooms clean and stockedWait staff/manager/owner-upbeat polite that's the upside!The downside!2 and half hours!Service is Ssslllloooowwww!!!!(shorthanded)Ruby appetizer-was enjoyable however the price leans on extortion and it was missing the shrimp cocktail, we chose medium shrimp as an alternate, great seasoning but it was overcooked this came in tow of the Ruby and before our drinks arrived. When the drinks arrived is when we finally received silverware, we ordered entrees fish tacos and half chicken after waiting close to an hour the chicken arrived with disappointing news that they were out of fish tacos ( did we want to order something else?) we declined due to the slow service, and after being asked how things were and our response was ""disappointed but the chicken was great"" there were no adjustments for the taco debacle, (basically we shared one entree) they did offer an apology and a comment that they were out of tacos earlier (why not say that when we ordered them?) and at the end of the meal is when our glasses of water arrived, that sealed our irritation and we vowed never to dine at the The Pearl again!  as we part i  have to add that the owner did come back for a table touch and asked AGAIN how things where I repeated my disappointment, the manager/owner smiled coyly and replied ""oh you still mad about the tacos"" that comment is what made me mad and the flickering light in the fixture didn't help the matter as we waited another 20 min for the check. This place is a raw bar at best they should focus on the quality of the Raw Bar items and and serve just that and cocktails ONLY!!! Dining is not a strong or formidable attribute and the owner/manager might consider staying off the floor, he is not a problem solver nor a people pleaser!",2,7/31/2021,The Pearl
133,"I can't wait to go back before the outside patio gets closed down. The inside is sort of small but really cute. The food was delicious. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and it was good. It just needed to be a little more cheesy. The crab cake was also good, just needed to be in the over a little longer to make the top crispy. The parm fries were also good. We shared everything as we weren't that hungry but looking forward to going back to try some other dishes. Also, the bartender Mitchara was soooo great! She was able to suggests drinks for us based of what we said we liked. She was also super nice and friendly. Hopefully she will be there next time I go.",4,8/3/2021,The Pearl
134,"We were expecting to enjoy this restaurant and atmosphere because of recommendation from the TV show Chronical. We drove an hour, what a disappointment! I ordered a drink, a glass of Riesling. The waitress said they were out of Riesling, this is Saturday evening, they have a full bar service!! I ordered something else. We ordered our meal, one of the orders was a burger, cooked well done. When the burger finally arrived, It was red inside, the fries looked like they were refried several times. They were oily, soggy and limp! Furthermore, the service was lacking, wait staff was not well trained. In times of COVID the waitress was not wearing a mask. The plates were not on a tray when carried out to the tables, wait staff not wearing gloves, fingers touching plate near food being served. Let's just say we will not be returning!",1,8/7/2021,The Pearl
135,I've had the pleasure of eating at The Pearl twice now and both times were amazing! The staff are always friendly and helpful. The service is timely and the food great!

Everything I've tried from the menu has been good so you really cannot go wrong.,5,8/10/2021,The Pearl
136,"I appreciate and support our local restaurants. It's great to have a new establishment to enjoy. From my views of the website and my first impression walking up to the spot, I had high expectations. The ambiance, the music, the scenery was all great. The restaurant is a bit small but the outdoor seating provided a bigger feel. Once settled in our seats I began to realize this experience may not be what I had hoped for. My party of 4 was sat at 2 high tops combined to accommodate us. Not one but both tables were broken. The table tops were like eating on top of balance boards. They were so topsy turvy that we were worried our drinks would spill. We asked the staff could we move to the next open table but we were denied because it was set up for 5 and we only had a party of 4. The host said they would put something under to stabilize it. No one ever came so we asked again and the gentleman told us that there is nothing he could do because it was the table top that was broken and it did not need leveling. So we are stuck with 2 wobbly tables reminiscent of middle school lunch tables. We order our drinks and I began feeling water dripping down my back then directly on my head. I look up and there is  a towel wrapped around a leaking AC duct. I guess I was lucky, it seems I got the worse seats in the place. Finally after moving my chair to the side of the table the staff recognized the issues and moved us. Now at our new seats the journey into the Seafood Grill began. We started off with some grilled oysters. The flavor profile was on point. But they were over cooked. The spinach was good but Parmesan cheese was a bit burnt and hard. The oyster itself was over cooked to the point it was like chewing yesterday's gum. We also ordered the crab dip but it was overlooked so we did not receive it until our entrees were finished. It was decent, the Gouda and hot peppers were the focal point of the dish. The warm lobster roll was good. Nice and warm with a buttery herb flavor. The Cape Cod chips were amazing..... Honestly skip the chips unless they are homemade. The chips gave it a lobster roll at a pizza joint feel. Some Parmesan fries would have been a perfect substitute. Lastly the fish tacos were . The hake was fried to perfection and the condiments enhanced the crispy, sweet and buttery fish. The service was pretty attentive. My only gripe was the waitress not informing us our crab dip was overlooked until we asked. Since I know the establishment is new, I am willing to give it another shot. Possibly in a few months. Hopefully they are able to work out the kinks. I believe with a little tightening up of the ship they can shoot to a Clayton's 4 star spot.",2,8/19/2021,The Pearl
137,"We went to The Pearl last night and the food and service were excellent. We didn't have to wait long at all for our food and our server, Ronald, was very attentive.

139,"I was excited about a new raw bar and seafood grill that opened in the South Bay district. I made a reservation for 1130 and we are the first customer. Even we arrived, the staff forgot they were opened and put their mask back on. The restuarant opened at 11 but we got there around 1125, they still setting up. We wanted to ordered raw oysters but was told they don't have staff to open the raw oysters but they can do the cooked oysters. We ordered the chargrilled oysters, crab stuff on oysters, spicy crab dips, and truffle fries. I ordered Ipswich crispy clam roll because I been craving crispy clams. Staff was friendly but the kitchen is slow. After 30min, our food finally arrived one by one. After 12, our server informed us that they can do raw oysters but since we ordered cooked oysters, we just skipped it. Probably will come back again to try their large plate since it is available after 4 only.All the shops that served fried clams around Wollaston beach always had a long line and hard to find parking, I never get the chance to eat it this year since they only opened late spring until the end of summer. Now, I can come here when I am craving crispy clams all year long.",4,9/4/2021,The Pearl
140,"I've been to The Pearl twice. Once for lunch. Once for brunch. I really tried to like this place but I just can't. The food always LOOKS amazing but the taste is just completely off. The servers seem confused about the menu when you ask them questions. Also, they don't serve burgers during lunch which is extremely weird. My 3 stars is for the ambience. It's very cute inside and and out. I can see what they were going for, but I think a new chef is needed immediately.",3,9/13/2021,The Pearl
141,"The food at this place was EVERYTHING. We went out for a girls night and ordered the pearl seafood tower/platter (BOMB!), fish tacos, lobster alla vodka, warm lobster roll and the shrimp scampi...man listen, everything was divine. Now the wait on the other hand...the wait was really bad, like 45mins just to get our drinks kind of bad. My only recommendation for this place is to get a third bartender for Saturday nights. It's not that they were chit chatting you can see them working their behinds off -- but it was clear that they needed more help. Outside of the wait time the experience was great and I'm really excited to have a gem like this in Southbay.",4,9/19/2021,The Pearl

Above all that, the service was sensational. Ronald, our waiter, was so incredibly kind and made it such a warm, pleasant experience. Also, another staff member, I believe her name was Wanda I want to say, came over to check on us as well, was very funny, and made sure we were doing okay.

We got a table near the back which was great because there is a lot of activity around the bar and near the front of the restaurant. The atmosphere is very lively and festive which is wonderful. We ordered right away and we were served in under 30 minutes. We had the crab/Gouda dip, warm lobster roll, half chicken with mashed potatoes - and everything was delicious! Service was great - several different servers checked in on us throughout our meal and we saw the owners walking through a few times saying hello to various patrons.

149,"Can't say enough nice things about Pearl. I came here after trying another nearby small restaurant (they didn't take online reservations for one, and didn't have space when I walked in), and 110 Grill (where I sat at the bar for 10 mins with a menu and nothing else). Needless to say, I was preparing myself for disappointment after a so-far unimpressive night.But the management at Pearl immediately greeted me and made me comfortable at the bar. I was greeted and introduced to Jojo at the bar (genuinely phenomenal bartender). The managers are chatty and kind, and involved in service (which is always a good sign).To drink, I had the Black Walnut Manhattan and the Royal Apple Spiced Mule, both spectacular (flavor and sweetness was perfectly balanced). I had the Truffle fries and chocolate chip bread pudding (don't judge). In my experience, truffle fries are not hard to do well, and of course Pearl did. The bread pudding was outstanding.(I've come once before and eaten seafood (stuffed clams and oysters of some sort), but I don't recall the exact menu items. Everything was delicious then, too.) For a night out with myself, Pearl was the perfect destination. I'm so glad my earlier option didn't work out. What an amazing bar, restaurant, environment, and staff!",5,10/23/2021,The Pearl

My mother's came out first and a few bits in she had to return it bc the lobster didn't taste right she thought it was old. She got sick after. I never got a chance to try mine bc I was scare I would have the she experience so I canceled my order.

152,"I've come to the Pearl a couple of times and gotta say that the food here is absolutely amazing! I've had the grilled oysters, gumbo and scampi dishes. The flavoring of everything is done to perfection. Nothing is to dry or watery it's just right. I typically don't order dessert from most restaurants but after seeing a few people get the Apple Crumb Cheesecake I had to order one for myself and I'm glad I did. Very creamy and the apple pairing was just right. The overall ambiance of the Pearl is picturesque. It's pretty small and tight but the interior decor is worth seeing. Only complaint about this spot is the service and speed. The staff didn't really check in with us much and it took them a while to get our drink after we put our food order in. The food also takes quite some time to come out. I think it may have taken us close to an hour to get our food, BUT I did think it was worth the wait. With that being said order a starter!",4,11/15/2021,The Pearl

The owner also made his rounds to make sure everything was good and that everyone got their food. Now the FOOOOD:Sugar, spice and everything nice! Everything was delicious. Only real ehh thing was the mash potatoes was very garlicky...Will be back to try some more things off the menu.",4,11/26/2021,The Pearl
155,40 years of excellence. This was one of our top Three meals on the island and definitely of the exceptional class. Well not every dish was a home run certainly the lobster special and the appetizers are exceptional. Wonderful cocktails and wonderful service. Looking forward to returning.,5,12/11/2021,The Pearl
156,"Couldnt wait to try this place and support a black owned business. Unfortunately, things didn't work out that way. Let me set the scene.* host never actually booked our reservation for a surprise bday party despite calling a few times*Arrive: owner was rude and refused to seat us because the entire party wasn't there. How are we supposed to surprise someone if we are all standing at the door?*Waitress was rude and condescending. Didnt take everyone's food and beverage order. Never came to check on us. And when she mispronounced someone's name on their card she told us she was reading it in English. What does that even mean?*Asked to have a wobbly table fixed, waitress never even came back. *Most places will ask you if you're interested in dessert since it was a birthday dinner, this place brings you your coat. Yes, they brought us our coats to our table. The owner could of just came over and explained that another reservation was waiting for. *Our entire stay felt rushed. The food was good but not good enough to go back and risk being treated like that.",1,12/26/2021,The Pearl
157,"Both the service and food are impeccable at the Pearl. My husband and I decided to give this relatively new restaurant a try today, and I'm so happy that we did. Every single menu item was perfectly prepared. The spicy items (crab dip and salt and pepper shrimp) had some heat, but it wasn't overpowering. The batter on the shrimp and clams is light and airy. The oysters that we ordered were fresh and the fish tacos had a great crunch from the slaw. With regard to drinks, we tried the sangria and the Pearl Potion. Both were perfect complements to the food. All the servers were attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I'm so glad we finally tried this restaurant and look forward to my next visit.",5,12/29/2021,The Pearl
158,"I enjoyed my experience here!   I am a member of an 11 member restaurant club, where we try a new place each month.   I wasn't the organizer but the guy who was mentioned that when he made our reservation, they were quick to share it's a small place, and wouldn't be too happy if our plans changed.   Although I thought that was a strange reaction given they're a new business, given how restaurants have been horribly impacted the last 2 years, I let it go.They are correct though, it's a small place, so if you are bringing a larger party (6+) definitely do them a favor and call ahead.   We arrived sporadically which I'm sure was a bit annoying to them but once we were seated, everything fell into place nicely.Our server was on it!  Extremely friendly, very prompt and knowledgeable of the menu.   Our group typically orders a ton of items and shares so I wouldn't even begin to tell you all that we ordered, but what I can say is that everything was really good!   A couple things that stand out...the spicy crab dip (delicious and the perfect level of spicy), the bang bang shrimp (one of my favorites that I compare to other restaurants whenever they have it), and the gumbo (exploding with ingredients and flavor)Again, hats off to our server who had to endure a bunch of different tabs and credit cards and she managed us perfectly.   One thing I did notice was their drink menu consisted of mostly sweet craft cocktails.   I prefer drinks that aren't sweet so I ended up just getting a martini so hopefully they will introduce more savory cocktails to the menu.    I highly recommend The Pearl if you are in the area.  Very clean, very modern, the food is great, and the staff is friendly!",4,12/31/2021,The Pearl

160,"Drinks: Old Fashion, Mimosas, Bloody Mary, Sweet Tea MojitosFood: Lobster Vodka Sauce, Oysters (char and raw), Lobster Newburg, Fish Tacos....no dessertBathroom dance off music ...top notch sound systemManagement gets the most props here. Was celebrating a friends bday so it was a special day and the management turned it around to be a great experience. And I think that is key here when owners pick the right people to lead when things make a hard left too bad. So because of that gentleman this is a 4 star review instead of -0. Food and drinks were a mix of hits and misses. Even with that I would love to visit this place in the summer and enjoy eating on the patio.",4,1/31/2022,The Pearl
161,"Loved this place! Great for lunch on a Friday with a friend: quiet, we had space to chat, and time to catch up. Drinks were good and the oysters were on point as were the fries and salad. I think the hours are not accurate; they ARE open for lunch, so go, go, go!",5,2/13/2022,The Pearl

163,"My Caribbean Divas group went to the Pearl to celebrate black history month. We had a 4:30 reservation and made it on time. We were seated and got our drinks, so the night was shapping out to be great!! We ordered our appetizer and it took 1 hour to get it, we ordered our meals and most of what we wanted were not available.  We ordered dessert and they ran out. But through all this,  we had a FABULOUS time!!! The manager, Emmanuel, was very apologetic and attentive; we saw more of him than we saw of our waitress. He kept us abreast of the delays, made sure we were comfortable, and then the owner showed up and customer service went through the roof. We even got drinks and champagne on the house. So our black history celebration at a black own restaurant didn't turn out to be that bad after all. Under different circumstances, we would have left, but Emmanuel and the owner made it right. Drinks or no drinks. I definitely recommend going and experiencing and supporting them.",4,2/28/2022,The Pearl
164,"I love this tiny place.  Definitely need a reservation due to size.  Much more seating when outdoor is an option.  Excellent service.  Homemade Curry sauce (with mussels) is to die for and I put in my lobster roll.  Have gone four times, will keep going.  Easy to park, not easy for uber to find.",5,3/6/2022,The Pearl
165,"Ordered two salads with grilled chicken midday when they clearly weren't busy, one of the orders of chicken appeared to be freshly cooked chicken breast, the other was tiny strips barely anything (see picture) mind you the chicken is $7 extra on top of a $17 salad! Insane. The dressing was good, they also forgot the croutons that were listed on the menu. No one in the restaurant and they couldn't be bothered to put a little effort in. Won't be going back.",1,3/12/2022,The Pearl

167,I had the pleasure of dining here last night and I absolutely loved it. The vibes and the food was immaculate. I ordered the char grilled oysters and the bang bang shrimp as my starters. They were both so delicious! And could be shared between two people. For my main dish I ordered the spinach crab cheese stuffed salmon which was phenomenal and cooked to perfection. The food took a while to come out but the service and the food portions overall was great. I'll definitely be coming back!,4,3/18/2022,The Pearl
168,Arrived at just before 3pm and got seated at a 2 top.. Only seats about 30 or so folks in entire restaurant .  Ordered drinks that took forever and then round two took a while and we also ordered 6 shrimp cocktail that at 4pm still had not arrived  They didn't tell us until almost 3:30 that we couldn't order from regular menu because they do brunch u til 4...big miss. While our server was pleasant- this place is a shit show...45 minutes for 6 shrimp cocktail is absurd.  I may try again but as is...skip it,1,3/19/2022,The Pearl
169,"The food was delicious, but their service was terrible, my boyfriend & I went there to celebrate our 2nd year anniversary, reservation was set for 7pm, we didn't get seated until about 7:30pm, once seated, the host gave us the whole spill about ""90 mins, being mindful of other guest & their reservations""we placed our orders approx 20 to 30 mins afterwards, unfortunately our food didn't come to the table until about 9pm or so, we bought this to the managers attention as well, he was polite & understood our disappointment",4,3/22/2022,The Pearl

My friend chose this incredible restaurant. When I tell you that this restaurant is on fire, it's ! I love this place! This is a Black-owned business, and when we entered the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the owner. He was very friendly and personable. He answered questions that we had about the menu. He is a nice guy!Now...the food! I ordered the Fish Tacos and the Clam Chowder. The fish tacos were incredible. The clam chowder was incredible! The service was immaculate. Our server was on point!As a Virginian, I would drive from VA to Boston daily for this great food and incredible environment. I will be back!",5,4/9/2022,The Pearl
174,We came with no reservations the manager was very kind. Encouraged us to go to the bar and wait for a seat. Drinks were good but they are  understaffed the bartender was very busy and it was hard to get her attention to put in an order.  It was hard again to put in our food order we ordered truffle fries as an app. We waited a long time for our food fish tacos and French toast. The fries came well after the entrees. The fish tacos which was fried salmon were bland. Friendly staff but inattentive. Never again,1,4/10/2022,The Pearl
175,"All Was delicious! Our waiter was Awesome and super attentive! Ambience is great, Mimosas we're delicious. Def recommend",5,4/17/2022,The Pearl
176,The menu was very small! I feel like there were only a few options that weren't a $37 lobster roll. The calamari was okay but super small portion. The inside was cool but it's kinda like trying to be a club but also an elegant dinner spot. Overall it was okay but I do not think we will be back.,3,4/23/2022,The Pearl
177,"- made these reservations 4 weeks in advance and was called 20 minutes before our reservation to come at a later time because they were overbooked for today. I get it but that isn't my problem and today was my moms birthday and it was our first time here and they were starting off on the wrong foot already. Originally booked for 8pm and they told us to come back at 8:15-8:20. We came back at the time requested and our tables still were not ready.  Ended up leaving around 8:50pm because our table still was not ready. I understand things happen but this is super unprofessional. If you know you can't accommodate us please tell us that and we would have went else where and not have wasted our time. Ended up going home and ordering take out. Manager was trying to seat us at a bar with my younger sister who is a minor, which was odd. Didn't make reservations to be seated at a bar, made them to be seated at a table. - - We waited for more than an hour for reservations we made 3 weeks ago just to not end up being seated  because they were over booked. A terrible way to spend someone's birthday and won't be coming back. If this how you run an establishment, don't open a business. Poor management overall and will never know how the food was because our tables weren't ready. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Had us waiting outside in the cold for nothingIf a table isn't ready just isnt ready. Don't rush people to eat so you can seat us. He could have told us that at 7:40pm and we would have went somewhere else to eat in boston but instead wasted almost two hours in south-bay doing nothing and starving ourselves. I go to vegas every year and they don't even do this. A joke honestly but wish you guys all the best and will be sure to let people know how this went.Emmanuel maybe you should not be managing because based off the reviews seems like this is a reoccurring thing. Wish I read the reviews prior to coming. Would have went to purple shell instead",1,4/23/2022,The Pearl
178,"Looks like the place is newer and still has a few kinks to work out. Came for brunch on a Sunday. The already small menu had many staples missing, like clam chowder. Had the lobster roll and brunch burger, both were over cooked. The lobster was chewy and overall lackluster. The chargrilled oysters were not great, had a sandy texture. Tried out the fries with shrimp and crab, it was gritty and these cheese was separating and greasy. Hoping it's only because they're new!",3,4/24/2022,The Pearl

Check out the pictures to see how fresh the Maine lobster was and how vibrant the shrimp was. Also their cocktails are top notch.

183,Love this place! Drinks were great and food was delicious. Also had the grilled oysters and bang bang shrimp which stole the show (sorry no pics we devoured instantly). Highly recommend.

Everything was hot when delivered the Cobb salad, bang bang shrimp, and crab cake were the table faves. We had to send the lobster Mac back because we couldn't find the lobster and the fries only were only topped with shrimp so they had to remake them.Overall The Pearl had a great ambiance and I'd visit again for the 90s music.",4,5/29/2022,The Pearl

First off when we get there we learn that the menu is different than online during certain times so they didn't have a lot of things we thought (ok fine whatever). So we order drinks, and I'm asking the waitress what she recommends. I am not a seafood person but thought I would try the lobster and waffles due to her recommendation. They bring the food out, it's literally 1 waffle and a tiny piece of lobster for $40, ok cool. I try it (literally took less than a bite) and both me and my friend both didn't like it, it was salty and hard to chew. So I tell the waitress and she tells me ok she'll tell the cook and see if he can take it off, cool. She never told me whether he said he can or not, then disappeared. Not only did they charge me $40 for a lobster waffle that I didn't eat they ALSO TOOK IT BACK. So I pretty much gave them that for free. I spent over $100 and gave a nice tip which is nice of me seeing as I will not be coming back!",1,6/13/2022,The Pearl

I had clam chowder which was okay. I also ordered the warm lobster roll (pictured) with truffle fries. The fries were over cooked and not very appealing. The lobster roll was amazing. My husband ordered the seafood Trinity w/o curry. (Pictured) He really enjoyed it as well as their homemade balsamic vinaigrette and the salad. I recommend the Pearl Potion (pictured) sweet and smooth. Staff was friendly and helpful.",4,6/28/2022,The Pearl

191,This a great little gem in the brand new neighborhood of South Bay.  Paid a visit on our anniversary.  Nice atmosphere on a summer evening. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Easy background music low enough to carry on a conversation and not shout over. An active welcoming atmosphere. Friendly happy to see you staff  and servers. Best was the mussels in white wine . My only reservation was the lobster rolls. You have a choice of warm vs cold. The warm was a little too warm and the cold was warm.  Other than that we will surely return. A nice convenience  is the free parking in the spotless and security patroled garage upstairs.  Give it a try.,5,7/1/2022,The Pearl

It's very spicy but flavorful. My friend loved it. We also ordered the crab dip!! Omg heavenly father was it good! We also ordered the truffle fries,  it's good like truffles should be. We also ordered the shrimp taco & salmon tacos. I like the freshness of t hy e salmon tacos it's more of a lightly fried salmon. I didn't try the shrimp taco but she loved them. For drinks my strawberry martini made with tequila had me almost on my behind,  strong and good!! The I believe it's called lemonade strawberry,  very very good, sweeter.

211,Great vibe and fantastic food! Service was friendly and attentive! I highly recommend this place!,5,9/28/2022,The Pearl
212,"Over all a ok spot! Drinks look fancy, mine was fine. I didn't order food but looking at the menu doesn't seem worth it, very generic things, nothing exciting. One thing that's exciting for the owner is that they charge lots of basic salads lol lol! Music was good also stuff was great! Management do better",3,10/15/2022,The Pearl
213,"I stumbled across The Pearl on Instagram when a friend was attending an R&B Brunch one Sunday. By chance, it happened that I was heading home a few weeks later, causing me to add this to my Things To Do list. I called my Bestfriends and told them we had to do a Bestfriend Brunch at The Pearl. We made reservations for 6 for Sunday afternoon. By the time we arrived, due to scheduling, it was only 3 of us. The hostess at the door was very understanding and was able to adjust our seating. Huge Thank You to her!The venue is quaint and trendy. It presents an All-American bar aesthetic while making a great use of the space and keeping clean lines. There is outdoor seating as well which allows for the expansion of the seating area when the weather is good. Once seated, our waitress came over to take our drink order. As always I ordered a Sweet Tea which to my delight, though I was in Boston, it had the Southern Charm that I have grown to enjoy. The ambiance was fun and upbeat. The music selection was spot on and blended old school jams with some of today's top hits. The vibe the establishment sets are infectious forcing you to think nothing but happy thoughts as you enjoy all The Pearl has to offer. Our theme was Friends, Fun, and Food!We ordered from the Brunch Menu which is styled with Shareable options. We decided to just order from all over the menu to maximize our taste options. To note, the food is made to order so please be patient and know that everything most likely will not come out at the same time. The great thing is that the waitress set our expectations for this in advance. Once our food came, not only was it pleasing to the eye but it was a mesmerizing, taste bud tingling, good for the soul experience. The flavor variations provided in each dish play off one another allowing for maximum enjoyment. The Bacon (you know I love bacon) is a perfect cut that is made to perfect crispness. The potato bowl is a medley of hidden pleasures combined into a dish of delight and rave. The salmon is meaty and perfectly cooked. The tenderness of the fish selection adds to the perfect grill of the outside. The French toast, oh my goodness. The French toast is an experience all by itself and leaves you speechless... Yes! It's that good. The Pearl is a great option for any meal and any occasion. This is one to add to the Must Visit list as it is an experience that is needed any day of the week. -Happy Eating!",5,10/16/2022,The Pearl
214,"Very disappointed with all the hype surrounding this very small restaurant. Had ordered oysters, truffle fries and clam chowder to start. The oysters came at a reasonable time but as for the clam chowder and truffle fries I had it to go since it came out after my main course. The shrimp scampi was flavorless and very watery. My fault because I didn't see one good review about the pasta but decided to try anyway. The half chicken and potatoes were salty but edible. A little pricy for the quality of food. Thank you to the bartender, JOJO she made a really good cosmo. That was the only thing I enjoyed tonight.",1,10/25/2022,The Pearl
215,"We were so excited to try this restaurant out, but it was absolutely disappointing. Service and food was absolutely awful. It took 45mins to get our drinks and about an 1.5hr to get our appetizers. The truffle fries arrived cold. We decided to leave and not wait for the entrees because they kept telling us it was going to be a few minutes and they were short staffed. We told the server we were no longer interested in the entrees and asked for the bill. She informed the manager and he didn't even bother coming over to speak with us. They just took our 2 drinks of the bill. Please do better and actually care about your customers.",1,11/1/2022,The Pearl
216,Service was great! Food was a little overpriced but tasty! Inside sounded real busy and a little loud but the playlist was on point. Sat outside was a little chilly in the shade but it's New England in autumn so it's to be expected. Cute little brunch spot! I would return for that crab dip OKAAAY!!!,3,11/5/2022,The Pearl
217,"This place is amazing it's in such a convenient location. The staff as well as the food and drinks are so amazing, their decor and music are such a nice touch and I have an amazing experience anytime I come with family and friends. We recently had the pleasure of having Jerry as our server and she did a phenomenal job I'll definitely keep coming back thanks to her!",5,11/9/2022,The Pearl
218,i've been coming to the pearl since they've been open and i've had exceptional service ever since. Manny and Luther always greet me and make me feel welcomed. Jerry is by far the best server ive had and i always request her whenever i pop in.,5,11/9/2022,The Pearl
219,"It was nice to see a new restaurant pop up in this space!  Momi Nonmi is a Japanese/Hawaiian small plates restaurant, with a similar style and price point (maybe slightly lower) as Bisq, Oleana, and Moona.  We had several dishes, but the standouts for us were the tuna poke and the wagyu dumplings.  Both of them were delicious, especially the sauces they came in, so we just had to get some rice on the side so as not to let the sauces go to waste.  The sake choices were extensive and the staff were unpretentiously knowledgeable about what to try.  Highly recommended and a great addition to the neighborhood!",5,10/8/2017,Momi Nonmi
220,"We went for dinner, ordered 6 dishes.  They are small plates but very tasty, unfamiliar izakaya.  The waiter called one dish ""umami-forward"". First time I've heard that expression but he was right.  I hope they will change the menu periodically so we can go back.  It was $70 for two, before the tip.  Nice place that feels far from the world outside.  Desserts are minimalist, which is probably what desserts should be.",3,10/11/2017,Momi Nonmi
221,"We live in the neighborhood and were so excited to see that they finally opened up.We stopped by last Friday night and were so disappointed.  The price doesn't justify the quality or quantity of food. We ordered the edamame croquettes (bland flavor with just simple shiracha sauce), the seafood okonomiyaki (frozen seafood with no seafood flavor. I can make better ones at home.) and the sashimi (unbelievably tiny and thin to a point we didn't even have to chew; they just melted away in my mouth).My friend and I both have small appetite but we still went home hungry.  We got pizza afterwards.  Music was also too loud making it kind of noisy.This is not a regular izakaya place, with drinks and satisfying small eats. If you have a car, drive down to Brighton instead.",1,10/16/2017,Momi Nonmi
222,"Former Uni chef comes across the river to open an original Uni-sized restaurant in Cambridge.  Sashimi is top notch, and now includes the richness of Hawaiian tradition, incorporating poke, and richer flavors in the new menu.Also participating is Sake Steve - also formerly from Uni - who will now teach anyone willing to listen and learn about all the varieties and greatness of sake.The vegetarian choices are also excellent - but just going through all the varieties of sashimi will make anyone very very happy.Truly great place; worth a trip not only from Boston, but also from New York City, to come to Cambridge; the chef has his own take on the food, which you won't find elsewhere.... and you won't find better sake elsewhere.",5,10/19/2017,Momi Nonmi
223,"The food is very good, but the portions are absurdly small. Be prepared to order a LOT of them if you have any appetite at all. Tasty and trendy and all that, but really not worth the money.",3,10/28/2017,Momi Nonmi
224,"Super excited to see this great addition to the neighborhood.  We went for the first time tonight, if you know the space its small, but cozy, not cramped.  Overall we really enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back (we're a 10 min walk from our place).   Service was great (we sat at the bar with Koko) and I love the combination of Japanese/Hawaiian influences.  Ok, on to the food:The tuna poke was very good, but the fish was cut very small and it was very generously sauced (almost like a soup) so the ratio of fish to dressing could have been better.They had a tuna onigiri dish which was very tasty, not quite what I expected, definitely an unusual twist on such a simple traditional dish.The shishito peppers were awesome, definitely place an order for these.My main disappointment was with the sashimi bronzini, looked promising but the hot sesame oil on the top was too much and took away from the flavor from the other elements of the dish.So not 100%, but definitely worth a try.  Come in quick because that toro flight special they have going looks awesome (didn't try it so we'll be glad to head back soon).",4,10/29/2017,Momi Nonmi
225,"Been twice since they opened and both times were really great. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly, they created a very pleasant atmosphere. The food was very tasty, definitely on the expensive side but worth it. It's a small restaurant so it's a good date spot, not really ideally suited for parties larger than 4. Recommending the rock shrimp tempura.",5,11/2/2017,Momi Nonmi
226,"Raindrop dessert is here in the USA! One of the latest trends in Japanese desserts is in Boston and I couldn't wait to try it. Momi nonmi seats around 30 people, mostly at small tables. I would recommend hopping over asap to try them about before they start getting packed. Went for brunch Sunday and tried the loco moco, tuna poke, deconstructed oyako dip, okonomiyaki, and raindrop dessert. Favorite was the okonomiyaki because I personally have a traditionalist preference and the okonomiyaki was the most traditionally Japanese out of the four mains. There was so much seafood in the okonomiyaki and I couldn't be happier. Fresh baby scallops, mussel meat, baby shrimp, squid, sometimes multiple in each bite. Overall pros: very delectable sauces that came with each dish, very fun (probably the loco moco on a sizzling hot place taking the cake on ""fun"", very happy the chef insisted on having the sauce poured at the table), and chock full of the good stuff aka the worth-it stuff like tuna in the poke and seafood in okonomiyakiOverall cons: dish sizes are small so definitely a group (a small group) is a good idea try multiple dishes, the brunch menu and lunch menu are a little limited (dinner packs the most punch but also the most $), tight space so get cozy if there's lots of people Reservations can be made on Yelp!",4,11/7/2017,Momi Nonmi
227,"This place is pretty cool.  It's tiny maybe 8-10 tables plus 4 seats at the bar.  Nicely decorated in a very minimalist style. They serve Japanese style small plates. We got shishito peppers, roasted romanesco, Spicy  tuna sashimi (not traditional - really excellent) salmon sashimi (again not just fish, it has kiwi and avocado) rock shrimp tempura and seafood Okonomiyaki. Everything was pretty awesome.  Extensive sake list and Our server was a total sake nerd (very high compliment!) so lots of info recommendations are available.  Dessert was totally crazy, some sort of clear gelatin. Way better than it sounds!  We really like it!",5,11/11/2017,Momi Nonmi
228,"I had high hopes for Momi Nonmi, as I love Japanese food, but I was disappointed tonight.I had dinner here for an anniversary, on 11/14 at 6:45 PM. In summary, there were issues with underseasoning, poor frying, and food texture.Brussel Sprouts: Outside was dried out, possible from over-baking, but the inside was still mushy.Edamame Croquettes: Exterior of the croquettes were hard and overfried, while the inside was mushy and lacked any discernible texture besides mushiness.Salmon Sashimi: Very plain and a tad underseasoned. Fish quality was acceptable but overall the dish was underwhelming. Nothing bad about it, but nothing good either.Butternut Squash Soup (special): Tasted very, very clammy. Not a good seafood flavor, coming from a seafood lover. Tasted bad in a bad way - like something you might get sick from eating.Loco Moco - Sauce good, fried egg good, but the beef patty was pretty much unseasoned! I actually prefer my food on the slightly under-salted side, but I think someone forgot to put even a little salt on the beef.Vegetable Tempura - Might be the hardest tempura I've ever had. Instead of the light, fluffy tempura fry that the Japanese are known for, this tempura was rock hard and also underseasoned. Had to make up for the lack of flavor with overuse of the Japanese ranch dip that came with it, but that ran out and the kitchen did not refill it despite requesting more.Okonomoyaki - Flavors were good, but it lacked the nice crispy top that okonomoyaki should possess. This meant there was no texture contrast with the mushy part underneath.Sake was good. Interior design and furnishings were nice and modern. Service was friendly as well. But the food was just so disappointing. I also wanted to add that the prices were not too bad (high for Inman Square, but not at all high for Japanese food in general) - so this review is not a value judgment; the food just fell short.",1,11/14/2017,Momi Nonmi
229,"This is really a 4.5. The food was fantastic, fresh, and tasted great. The staff was very knowledgeable and great for recommendations. The restaurant is small but quite cozy and not very loud.  Overall we really liked this place and would happily go back.",4,11/15/2017,Momi Nonmi
230,"This place is spectacular. I have been for lunch and dinner, and both were some of my favorite meals that I've had in the past few months. The menu is filled with Japanese cuisine with lots of Hawaiian influences (it's super unique -- I don't think there is anything in Boston like it). If you visit for late night, a must-try is the Mochiko Chicken, a wonderful Hawaiian dish.For lunch, you need to get the Shokado Bento. Beautiful and I loved getting a taste of nine different things.Excellent service -- incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff. This place will be one of my regular spots.",5,11/19/2017,Momi Nonmi
231,"I wanted to like this place, but I really can't recommend it. The biggest problem is value for money: e.g. 4 brussels sprouts for $7; a radish-sized portion of sea bream for $16; 6 tiny slivers of veg. tempura for $10. Some tables were getting freebies from the kitchen, which might have improved the experience. But if you don't happen to know any of the staff, to get a full meal will cost $80+ per person--and the food just isn't worth it. Some dishes were good (the poke), others really disappointing: that sea bream, for instance, was lifelessly bland in addition to being microscopic. Also of concern: the menu on the night I visited featured the notoriously endangered bluefin tuna. Finally, the service was a bit cold. In short, I hope this place goes out of business soon so something better can take its place.",2,11/20/2017,Momi Nonmi
232,"Lovely place. Pretty small so be sure to make reservations. Went here for lunch with my fellow foodie friend BostonBestEatsX. for lunch. We ordered a few dishes along with their bento box. We also had a sake flight each. Our server Rachel was wonderful and very knowledgeable. We had the tuna poke bowl and also the loco moco bowl. Both were delicious. I definitely liked the loco moco, it was super flavorful. The bento came with 9 little bowls of different small bites. We learned the momi nonmi pretty much translates to Precious Drinking Place. And momi is also the name of the owner's Pomeranian! I must come back for dinner because I really want to try the uni dish on the dinner menu. Will be back soon!",5,11/21/2017,Momi Nonmi
233,"Don't believe the hype. Walked in on a Saturday lunch. I was really looking forward to the bento box, only to be told they were all out. At 12:45pm you're out of the main entree? Who does the food shopping at this place! Then I was told they had one more available, but 2 minutes later not. Apparently, miscommunication is a real problem in the kitchen. Food: poke was good (nothing to make you drive out to Sommerville for it), loco moto was undercooked and flavorless (despite the fajita style show), and finally the fried chicken entree turned out to be a tasteless potato crocquet. All in all, a poor attempt at something new. I recommend a stroll further down the block for some real inspiring food! Thumbs down!",2,11/25/2017,Momi Nonmi
234,"Food was delicious, sake was amazing and service was fairly nice too. The portions were a little smaller than I imagined but, oh well. :)",4,12/2/2017,Momi Nonmi
235,"We went for brunch and got the Shokado bento, seafood pancake, 2 toro sashimi, and raindrop dessert. It looked beautiful and was a great attempt at authentic Japanese brunch. Very small portions so we left hungry and still managed to spend $160. I recommend all of the above except for the Toro sashimi. It was tough to eat and did not melt in your mouth like you would expect. It had the white chewy tendons I guess you would call it. I don't know why they even served it and for $18 a slice? It was very disappointing. Glad I tried it but not likely I'd return.",4,12/5/2017,Momi Nonmi
236,"Very cute hidden Japanese itzakaya. Favorites were the waygu beef dumplings and surprisingly the shishito peppers! The fish/Sushi courses were too overly seasoned and garnished for us-- for example the poke was like 40% tuna, 60% scallions! We had to pick out the fish because the garnish was so overwhelming. Same with the salmon sashimi. The dessert was delicious- we got the mochi with red bean and green matcha which was delicious. Would definitely come back to try the lunch bento box and would try dinner again, but probably not get the fish.",4,12/10/2017,Momi Nonmi
237,"Woah people weren't joking about the small portions. They are very small! Good flavor food, well balanced, but for the quantity, the prices are quite high. The waitress was very kind, so I had no problems with the service. The bento box was fun with an assortment of dishes. I just can't get over the quantity. Unfortunately though I won't be coming back, because I was still hungry after leaving.",3,12/28/2017,Momi Nonmi
238,"SASHA SAYS: Don't hate me because my OMAKASE is more beautiful than your OMAKASE!!!My second visit to Momi Nomi was for a special omakase dinner held on December 18th, joined again by my Yelpie friend Sasha...We arrived for the first of 2 seatings at 6:30 (after pre-dinner cocktails at nearby Puritan & Co.).  Rather than review each of the 10 courses, I think the photos speak for themselves, so I'll just list the dishes we enjoyed, the sake pairings, and some overall impressions at the end.HIGHBALL: With Mars Iwai sake1ST COURSE: Uni, with parsnip, cauliflower, cranberry (paired w/ Kiminoi yamahai jumbo daiginjo sake)2ND COURSE: Bay scallop, with winter squash, black garlic, radish (w/ Hakkaisan honjozo sake)3RD COURSE: Toro, with persimmon, habanero, yamaimo (w/ Satsuma Shiranami shochu, centrifuged lime, simple)4TH COURSE: Truffle, Pacific shrimp, avocado, purple daikon (w/ Yuki no Bosha junkai ginjo sake)5TH COURSE: Sashimi, pickles, yuzu, wasabi (w/ Watari Brune 55 junmai ginjo sake)6TH COURSE: Kanpachi, beet, golden caviar, pomegranate (w/ Jozen hiyaoroshi sake)7TH COURSE: Abalone, with brown butter, endive, curry (w/ Yahoo Rhythm of the Centuries junmai yama-oroshi sake)8TH COURSE: Foie gras, toro, rice, chocolate (w/ Kikumasamune junmai, smoke, white soy cocktail)9TH COURSE: A5 wagyu 3 ways (w/ Gokoo barley shochu, Tenshi no Yuwaku imo shochu)COCKTAIL: Sake & espresso10TH COURSE: Zenzai, red bean, matchaAs you can see, this was a spectacular meal...inventive, interesting and delicious.  But beyond the food, it is important to note that Momi has an actual, certified sake sommelier, Stephen Connolly, who is not just a repurposed wine sommelier but someone who has spent his career studying sake.  So the pairings, and the descriptions that accompanied them, took this meal to totally different level.  There is nowhere in Boston that does sake like Momi does!  He was also ably assisted by Koko Usui, who you may remember from the excellent bar at Cafe ArtScience during the Todd Maul era.Our meal was perfectly paced, and the service was excellent.  Chef Chris Chung also came out to chat with us at the end of the meal.  For $165, not a cheap night out, but well worth it give the quality of the ingredients.Keep your eye out for future special events like this one (they also had a shorter omakase for New Year's eve).[Click below to see my previous lunch review.]",5,1/8/2018,Momi Nonmi
239,"What a delicious surprise in Inman Square!  Fantastic little plates - izakaya-like, but with very interesting and tasty twists.   Everything was fresh, light, and intriguing - spirit of Japanese food with  non-traditional ingredients.  I'm looking forward to returning and introducing more friends  to this great addition to Boston area dining.",5,1/9/2018,Momi Nonmi

241,"Once again, another delightful meal at Momi Nonmi! From the genuinely passionate service to the fastidiously prepared dishes, momi nonmi has continued to impress us. Everything we've tried comes highly recommended - the rose, the Hawaiian poke, the shishitos, the Yuzu-harissa cauliflower, the branzino sashimi, just to name a few - are all aesthetically stunning, beautifully crafted, and wonderfully aromatic culinary creations. Definitely take advantage of their sake somm Steven, he's very knowledgeable and genuinely loves sharing cool finds and different ways to enjoy their wonderful selection. Don't be afraid to try the sake flight! I've never been disappointed by the selections he's made and it gives you a rare opportunity to try a high quality selection of styles. We were made aware of a monthly omakase which we will DEFINITELY be back for. Bravo Elaine and the Momi Nonmi team!",5,1/13/2018,Momi Nonmi
242,"One of the best brunches I have ever had. The bento box was phenomenal with the exception of one dish that was slightly salty. Service was also a little shotty. Food more than made up for it though.Bento Box items: 2 types of sashimi, duck gyoza (was on the salty side), tuna fritter, cauliflower/brusselsprout soup, fried chicken, marinated seabass, poke, and tofu w. caviar",5,1/14/2018,Momi Nonmi
243,"Short review: tasty food, good service, but overpriced for a bite of food. Don't bother going.Long review: have been meaning to check this place out. Cool vibe, quaint. Went there with my wife. Tapas plate ranges from $12-26 which is fine for a high end place, but when we got the food, they were not appropriate tapas sizes. For example, we got the large sashimi for 2 which was $56. We're told we would get 20 pieces. What we got instead were 10 pieces of sashimi, about a 3rd of the traditional size, that was further cut in half. Pretty ridiculous. We even had a few more dishes, but left the the place starving. Went down the street and got pizza instead. There are several great sushi restaurant in the Boston area, so save your money and try another place. If you are not footing the bill, then sure, give it a try.",2,1/14/2018,Momi Nonmi
244,"Lovely, unique, and simply delicious, Momi Nonmi is the type of place that just feels special.Walk through the exterior curtain and come inside. We had a reservation for 1PM on a Saturday and were seated right away in the quaint space. Our server was very helpful in describing the different drinks, including some unique-sounding sakes! I went for the first option in the pour-over format, where he pours from the bottle into a glass cup which is sitting within a box, so that the sake flows a bit over the sides of the glass and the run-over is caught in the box. Very cool presentation, even if I couldn't exactly figure out how to gracefully drink the liquid in the box. The sake itself was delightful, slightly warm with a clean flavor and hints of banana.We saw that most of the tables had a bento box, so we asked our server what was in it. He explained that the contents of the bento ""changes by the minute"" according to the chef's preferences! He was able to name a few things ours was likely to have, and we ordered it right away. It's an ideal way to get to sample some of the chef's best and most innovative bites!We also ordered the Loco Moco which is a beef patty over white rice topped with a fried egg. The mushroom sauce is poured over the top at the table and sizzles on the hot pan. The video is very Insta-worthy! And the flavor was great: simple while being comforting and just made well.The bento was a thing of beauty. Another one for the IG! Ours contained 9 delectable morsels including sashimi, tofu, fried chicken (our waiter's fave), a croquette, mussel soup, and ahi tuna. It was a great combination of raw and cooked, and it felt light while still being filling.Just writing this review makes me want to go back and sample what other delights the chef has dreamed up! Om nom nom.",5,1/22/2018,Momi Nonmi
245,"Interesting menu with food that is beautifully presented and delicious.  It is a small plate menu with three plates per person recommended for dinner.  We enjoyed everything we ordered but it ended up being quite pricey.  Nonetheless, I look forward to returning.",4,1/23/2018,Momi Nonmi
246,"Overall, everything could have been much better. The one thing that threw me off the most was the order in which they served. It should have been better planned out, not shuffling for main dish first, then sashimi, appetizer, then main again, etc.. The palate got confused, as a result. For appetizers we tried the shishito peppers ($6), roasted cauliflowers ($10), followed by mushroom onigiri ($13) and live scallop sashimi ($16) (black garlic, truffle vinaigrette), and the dinner specials: Uni cup ($24), Surf Clam ($19). Also the Calpico-containing drink ($12), and Shuffling Kimono ($13) (whiskey, roasted tea, lemon oil).The thing I liked the most is surprisingly the shishito peppers, which was flavor-wise very pleasant. The live scallop sashimi and surf clam were both decent (fresh, nicely crafted but not too special). Roasted cauliflowers were cold. The color of uni was dark/greyish and not a vibrant orange/yellow as I saw from the picture reviews here. Also it had an overwhelming amount of rice. The Kimono was all whiskey, virtually undetectable roasted tea or lemon flavor. Could have been a hit but they unfortunately didn't quite deliver it.",3,1/26/2018,Momi Nonmi
247,The extraordinary bento at lunch.The dinner specials The welcoming environment The sake flightsThe raindrop dessert Each of these is just one expression of Chef Chris Chung's exquisite artistry and collaborative teamwork.,5,1/29/2018,Momi Nonmi
248,"Delicious. Small. Plates. Get the rock shrimp, shishito peppers, and beef dumplings. Great service,  awesome sake, and good vibe.",5,1/31/2018,Momi Nonmi
249,"A myriad of outstanding reviews brought me to Momi Nonmi recently. Note that this is a dinner-review and may have to be enhanced once I try their lunch menu.Opted for the Roasted Brussel Sprouts, Duck Confit, Hien's Bronzini, The Rose, and Teppanyaki Loco Moco. The Hien's Bronzini was a bit too salty in my opinion, but still enjoyable nonetheless. The Loco Moco was an Instagram-worthy, fun moment to record when the server first poured the sauce into the grilled plate. The Loco Moco was also tasty, but unfortunately not the best I've ever had. To finish it off, I ordered the Raindrop Mizu Shingen Mochi, which was a beautiful, tasty dessert to share. The clear gelatin that resembled a raindrop coupled with black sugar and soybean powder pn the side was probably my favorite dish of all. As noted in other reviews, the portion was incredibly small here so it's worth going with 2-3 other people so you can order and share multiple different dishes. Bonus: You can make your reservation on Yelp!",4,2/4/2018,Momi Nonmi
250,"Momi Nomi is a cute Japanese restaurant in Cambridge. It is small, there are about 25 seats so you should definitely make a reservation. I am usually not a fan of fusion food, unless they do it well, and they did it well here.Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and did a great job of helping us select sake. She even knew which parts of Japan the sake came from. She told us that her favorite sake came in a sketchy paper cup... sketchy paper cup sounded good to us, so we ordered that. I don't remember which sake that was, but make sure to ask for sake that comes in a sketchy paper cup!In terms of food, we started off with the spicy tuna tartare. Let me tell you, it was spicy, they were not joking. If you don't have good tolerance, you might want to order rice on the side. We also had the hawaiin poke, because I love poke. We tried the edamame croquette- this was quite unique. I am used to having potato and pork croquette, so edamame was something new to me. We also had the wagyu beef dumplings and fried veggie tempura. The deep fried avocado was my favorite!! I felt as if I was eating avocado fries, and everything tastes better deep fried right? Usually tempura is dipped in ten tsuyu (which is a warm mixture of soup broth and soy sauce), here they served the tempura with ranch. The tempura did taste good with ranch. We finished off our meal with okonomiyaki, which was very filling. The okonomiyaki took a bit of time to make so you should definitely order it first. This is a great addition to Cambridge. I will be back for more sketchy paper cup sake! Also, I need to find a place to buy this awesome sketchy sake to drink at home...",4,2/5/2018,Momi Nonmi
251,"Great service and delicious food. We ordered shishito peppers-unreal! The cauliflower with harissa sauce was fantastic as well. From the rice section we chose the duck confit and we were not disappointed. We wanted a sashimi as well, and after reading through the menu we opted for the tuna tartar that is served with a rice cracker. The wagyu dumplings were great, although a little pricey for 4 small one bite dumplings. Definitely will be back to explore the sake half of the menu.",4,2/10/2018,Momi Nonmi
252,"I first met Chef Chris at the now sadly closed Journeyman at a pop-up dinner and really enjoyed his take on Japanese food, all quite simple and tasty. Then followed him quite a while on IG and am always amazed by how phenomenal his private dinners looked. So of course I was beyond excited when I heard about the opening of Momi Nonmi.This is quite a small place that is very simply decorated with wooden tables and aluminum chairs. My only complaints about the decor is that the yellow wood is really not photogenic at all for those of us who enjoys taking pictures of our food, and the chairs aren't very comfortable. Let's first start with the food, there is a wide selection of Japanese styled dishes on the menu. All are small plate sized and to be shared. For reference, the 2 of us shared 7 dishes total.UNI CUP: What's not to love about a cup full of uni? I believe these are from Maine so obviously not as good as Santa Barbara or Hokkaido but still tasted very fresh.TORO TIN: This was the special for the night, a tin of minced toro mixed with other colorful ingredients (sorry I can't remember them...) But it was definitely tasty. I only wish the toro component was a little bigger!THE ROSE: A quite beautiful plate of sea bream sashimi. It is fresh and light but the portion is quite small.DUCK CONFIT NIGIRI: Nigiri is not quite the right word for this plate. More like rice ball topped with duck confit. The duck was a little on the dry side for my taste but the spicy kabayaki sauce and chocolate glaze are very good.HAWAIIN TEPPANYAKI LOCO MOCO: Think fancy burger? A beef patty with sunny side up egg over rice, then the yummy gravy gets poured on top. The teppanyaki part is cool but I didn't feel it serve too much purpose.WAGYU DUMPLING: The dumplings have a nice thin skin and the wagyu filling is very flavorful. $18 for only 4 dumplings are pretty pricey though.ROASTED BRUSSEL SPROUTS: The weakest link here. The brussels weren't crispy and honestly I didn't care for the flavor either.Now the sake... The sake program here is headed by Steve which is absolutely wonderful. We had the chance to chat with him quite a bit while sitting at the bar area for our dinner. His knowledge of sake is quite impressive and we opted for several sounds of tasting pours that were both delicious and educational. Overall, a really good dinner. For the portions, I do agree with many reviewers that the prices are quite high. If I had to judge the restaurant for food alone, it may have been 3 stars. However for how much we enjoyed the sake tastings (though not cheap there either), we had such as wonderful time at Momi Nonmi. Will definitely be back!",4,2/12/2018,Momi Nonmi
253,"In the last minute realized Valentine's Day approaching, I decided to try this 4months old Japanese fusion that I've missed an Omakase event. I requested a table with good light since I like to take pics of the food especially for the first time. Salmon sashimi with kiwi and avocado brings up refresh favor to start our meal. My hubby arrived early and ordered couple different rice wraps, I would say the topping are good, but the rice is kind of disappointing, not sushi rice not sticky no vinegar and giving the price that $16ish for each. However, rice portion is quite amount so after three of them, hubby started to feel full Those impressed me the most are Shishito pepper, toro fight (best and off the menu so pls ask the waiter and waitress) and interesting raindrop dessert. Wayu beef dumplings are tasting, but I kind of agree with other reviewers that little bit overpriced. I think that one dish disappointed us both is rock shrimp, not as described tempura style at all, more like shrimp nuggets(maybe because it's fusion) I didn't get to try the Uni cup that really got my attention from previous reviewers, not available today so I got Toro fight as mentioned above. Overall, I would say it's a worth try place especially those not listed on regular menu! And I will come back to try brunch sometime.",4,2/13/2018,Momi Nonmi
254,"Delicious brunch - the bento box was great. Aside from the fried chicken which didn't feel quite Japanese, everything else was authentic. Some unique-tasting dishes too. Also ordered the wagyu beef special (A5 grade) which was amazing and melted in the mouth.",5,2/25/2018,Momi Nonmi
255,"I came Saturday morning for brunch. Note: Brunch is only on saturdays and sundays.Super cute small place so make reservations! You can do it right on yelp!The server, Rachael is super nice! She even recommended where to park. There are meters outside. They have special events every month! Check it out on their website.  Shokado nine course: delicious! I totally recommend this one. I'm not even going to attempt to tell you what they were Bc I don't even know! Haha The nine dish course change daily anyway! But take a look at the pics i posted if your curious. We also ordered the Hawaiian loco moco, which was alright a basic rice hamburg egg on top. Cool for videos only!The special for the day was toro belly on a bed of rice. So delicious so fresh this one was my fav! The rice is flavored perfectly!I saw on the other reviews they had a toro tin for a special one day. I am dying for one!!!! Looked delicious. Someone call me when they have it plz!!",5,3/3/2018,Momi Nonmi
256,"This place completely sucks. There is absolutely no redeeming feature.  The food is completelyover priced.  Not only are the portions are small, but the food's taste ranges from bad to average.  The chef has no sense of how the flavors work, and simply forces the flavors together in the dishes.  This just seems like another place trying to capitalize on Japanese cuisine's popularity, and disguises bad food behind the label of fusion cuisine.",1,3/8/2018,Momi Nonmi
257,"I have been following Chef Chung's Instagram for a while and when I saw he opened his restaurant Momi Nonmi, I was so excited and couldn't wait to try it. I wanted to book a dinner or late night reservation but when I saw the brunch bento, I immediately booked the brunch. And here starts my journey of disappointment. I went with two friends. Each of us ordered our main dish and we ordered two more dishes to share, which I told the waitress. When the waitress first came back, she brought one dish - the bento I ordered for myself, not for sharing, in the middle of the table. I ended up could only stare at my bento because neither of my friend had anything to eat. After some time, she came with the fried chicken my male friend ordered in front of my female friend, who ordered an egg dish. Neither dish is impressive. The dishes we ordered for sharing is a $16 or $18 wagyu beef dumplings. Four mini dumplings in a bowl. I have no problem with a $4 dumpling if it tastes good, but man...it was nothing special. Not to mention the wrap is so thin and saggy that one dumpling's filling was exposed before any one of us trying to pick it up from the bowl. The okonomiyaki we shared was so-so. I have made better ones at home.My biggest disappointment was that I liked none of the nine dishes in the bento. Just give some examples: the eel sauce fish is sooo salty that I had to wash it down with water. I would have eat it with rice but there was only one rice dish in the bento. The dumpling in the bento, especially the seam, is so hard to eat. The fried chicken doesn't taste like freshly fried because it warm at the best - while fried food out of the oil is supposed to be hot. The edamame fried ball itself is flavorless, and the  subtle edamame flavor, if any, is powered by the buffalo sauce, which in my humble view does not go well edamame. The sausage in the bento is another super salty dish. There were three pieces in the dish, I gave two to my friends to try and I ate one. But even trying to finish that small piece is a struggle - the sausage is so tough and really really salty, even saltier than the fish. Again, I had to wash it down with water. The egg in the burnt kale broth is quite salty as well - and the kale is so burnt that I could taste the bitterness. The rest of the bento were two  normal sashimi dishes, nothing memorable. My friends were doubtful about this restaurant even with its high Yelp review but I insisted in giving it a try. Seems they were right. Will not come back and would not recommend it to anyone. No picture was taken because I was quite disappointed at everything we got there. One star for the pretty plates.",1,3/20/2018,Momi Nonmi
258,"Although the food is authentic in the Japanese tradition, the restaurant is incredibly overpriced for the area and the portions were too small that we still felt hungry!This type of pricing and portion servings are only appropriate at high end area or 5 star hotels. We paid more than $130 for dinner for two people only! And the portions were too small that we had to go somewhere else to eat proper portions with reasonable prices for the area; as per our portions expectations! We didn't come to this area to pay more than $75 for our food and drinks!",3,3/28/2018,Momi Nonmi
259,"The food is too salty. We ordered only 3 dishes and decided to leave. My husband chock from the salt. It was costly, not worthy of money. Had trouble communicating with the Japanese waitress. We did not understand what she explained.",1,3/29/2018,Momi Nonmi
260,"Great service and the food was quite good. The tables are very close to each other so a loud couple next to us made it hard to converse for the surrounding tables. Otherwise the food is great. Would recommend at least 3 plates per person to share for dinner. Everything on the menu looks appetizing with a Japanese or Hawaiian inspiration. The plating is beautiful. Good for Instagram need. I would definitely go back again. That being said, my only gripe is that there was an A5 Miyazaki Wagyu that was mixed in with a bunch of different flavors. It tasted really good, but if you're going to eat A5 Miyazaki Wagyu I think it should be by itself or on a bed of rice to really taste it's flavors.",4,3/31/2018,Momi Nonmi
261,"Everything is wonderful here, top down, from menu, to vibe, to friendly and knowledgeable staff. Prices are a bit much, but not a deterrent from going back for sure.",4,4/1/2018,Momi Nonmi
262,"Fun place to get sake. Would recommend going just for drinks. Sake flight - 4/5. Highlight of the night at 3 for $21. I learned I preferred the cheapest one kikumasamune kimoto junmai hyongo sake. The person who gave the long gave a comprehensive explanation of each sake. Hawaiian poke - 4/5. Solid dish. Strong flavors. Tasty sauce. Okonomiyaki - 3/5. Very dependent on the mayo flavoring.Lomi lomi beets - 2/5. Spicy strong flavor that was interesting but I wouldn't get again.Veggie Tempura - 2/5. Disappointing, minimal flavor. Roasted cauliflower - 2/5. Pretty boring. Harissa sauce had quite a kick but the cauliflower itself didn't have much going on.",3,4/14/2018,Momi Nonmi
263,"This is probably the most interesting restaurant in all of Cambridge! I love the atmosphere here, and every dish is so creative and tasty! We came here without reservation and got a seat at the bar on a Saturday evening. We ordered the spicy tuna tartare, salmon tataki, loco moco, and the kalua pork onigiri for the two of us. All were delicious, but the best were the salmon and the loco moco. The dishes came out fairly quickly and the presentation was great!I got the grapefruit+calpico+shochu+tonic cocktail which was incredibly tasty! We also got the matcha zenzai dessert, which was only okay. The bill came out to about $100 for the two of us, but definitely worth it for a special occasion!!",5,4/14/2018,Momi Nonmi
264,"Of all the places I have tried here in Boston - Momo Nonmi is definitely on the top of the list! To begin - we got the bento box which is a variety box for 12 different chef specials. These sizes where personal sizes. However, my boyfriend and I shared the bento box and few other dishes.  Every single dish was perfectly prepared down to the smallest bites. I do not want to give a play by play because the whole point of this establishment is for the bento box to be a surprise! :) I love the authenticity of this establishment and the welcoming services. Keep in mind - this is a place where you will live perfectly happy and content from the perfection portions. Do not come here expecting to eat giant portions and walking out barely able to breathe. Overall - I cannot wait to come back! :) 10/10 would recommend.",5,4/15/2018,Momi Nonmi
265,"If you appreciate creative presentations with well-executed flavor profiles and a passionate, helpful staff, then Momi Nonmi is for you.  - Chef Chris clearly learned his craft well and is making his own mark here. Everything was awesome, but highlights for us were the duck confit, toro 3 ways, and an amazing wagyu carpaccio.  It's a small and informal place and if you'll get to hear/know your neighbors, but I thought that only helped the vibe.  Sake Sommelier Steve is awesome and my wife and I truly appreciated his insight and background on what he was pouring.  Portion sizes were just right for an izakaya and the service was spot on from everyone.  Highly recommended and we'll be back soon.",5,4/22/2018,Momi Nonmi
266,"Outstanding Japanese cuisine with a Hawaiian twist.  We had the Poke (outstanding) Fluke sashimi,  beet salad, beef cheek ravioli, and Wagyu.  All were well behind what you would find in the area outside of the two top Japanese places in town.  Service was attentive, well mannered, even when it was packed.  Chef Chris and team hit it out of the park.  Great location - a must try!",5,4/24/2018,Momi Nonmi
267,"First experience in here. Disappointed by 5 course Omakase! Nothing surprisingly good, instead I felt every course a bit strange with the spice, either too salty or sweet?(from my friend's word) The sashimi rice is too hard, tasted like the rice left from yesterday night although sashimi was pretty fresh and good. The last shared dessert was also a huge disappointment. It looked a cute shape, but taste nothing special... and too sweet. Service is ok, after complaining during the course, it offered a free pepper snack...but some of them are so spicy that drove me crazy, my mouth became numb...They explained to me after my painful experience that one out of ten would be super spicy, but they should have remind me beforehand. Overall, not worth the $55 price!",2,5/3/2018,Momi Nonmi
268,"3* and a half.We had 9 dishes in total(including dessert). The prices are higher than averages. Shishito Is highly recommended. Fresh peppers(not spicy at all) are gently grilled come with thin fluke fish pieces on the top. Seafood mix is another bomb. Pancake styled with seafood inside and mayonnaise sauce on the top. Delicious!Loco moco is also a ""must try"". Half cooked egg on the top, beef in the midde, rice ball on the bottom.However, there are some dishes need to be improved or recreated. For example, the vegetable tempura comes with the completely wrong sauce. It does not comes with the traditional tempura sauce. They use some weird wasabi sauce. This is a absolute failure.For the dessert, we tried the popular one which is the Rain Drop. It is very like a Chinese snack. Transparent jelly with brown sugar sauce and soybean powder. This sweet dish is recommended.",4,5/3/2018,Momi Nonmi
269,"Unbelievably beautiful and delicious! A worthy successor to East by Northeast. Chef's pop-ups were amazing, so it's great to see him in s permanent home. (If only if were walking distance to home; the late night menu is easier on the budget.)",5,5/18/2018,Momi Nonmi
270,"Don't go here if you know anything about Japanese food. I just came back from the restaurant with my husband. We were greeted by a pleasant server. The decor is welcoming and tasteful. I wish I could say the same about the food. The tuna tartare was far too salty. The cauliflower was small and uninteresting with a sauce that seemed just like tomato paste. The okonomiyaki was not like any we have had before: the seafood was poor quality, and it had what appeared to be Texas BBQ sauce on it. Too many corners cut and the price far too high. I am now eating cereal at home: after spending almost $100 I went away still hungry and disappointed.",1,5/27/2018,Momi Nonmi
271,"The restaurant is very small with only 5 tables and a few bar seats. We went in knowing the prices were pretty steep but because of the prices, we were expecting a WOW factor to the food but were disappointed. The flavors were mediocre and nothing stood out to justified the high price point. We left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied and hungry so went home and cooked ramen! The alcohol is expensive, expect to pay around $24++ for a 4oz bottle of soju. The staff seemed happy and engaged in conversation with all other tables but ours.",1,6/4/2018,Momi Nonmi
272,"Dined earlier this week. Love the space, very reminiscent of izakaya in Japan. Small, cozy and more importantly, welcoming. Petshop Boys playing in the background - very Japanese. Luv it! The live scallop sashimi was extremely fresh and sweet. I could have devoured a dozen easily :) Waygu dumplings served in a mushroom broth was fantastic! Thank you for the attentive service. I've been hunting for a gem like this!",4,6/9/2018,Momi Nonmi
273,"I travel to Japan often, so when an Izakaya-style restaurant opened nearby, I was excited! But unlike an izakaya, this place was not cheap, so I waited for a special occasion to visit. First and foremost - this is a ""small plates"" establishment. Instead of a plate of food thrown down onto your table, you are getting a micro-serving that arrives beautifully prepared and is truly a work of art. We were told 3-4 plates per person is about a meals worth of food, but that is laughably incorrect. We had about 5 plates per person, and I was hungry an hour later.There were a few issues.The rice (in a $12 onigiri... hah!) had some burnt rice bits in it. The tempura was lukewarm inside while the (delicious) crust was piping hot. I really hate to keep harping on the portion sizes, but in some plates it was absurd. A fish plate contained at most a square inch of said fish, sliced up into tiny pieces. The $18 wagyu beef dumplings come with 4 tiny bites that contained at most another square inch of meat. Most ""tapas"" or ""small plate"" restaurants seem like a rip off to me - but this is one of the few I've been to where I could see the intent and justification. This isn't a place I'd bring my parents or friends - but maybe my more well-off artsy friends who find the narrative of a meal as filling as the actual sustenance. I look forward to trying their (more affordable) late night menu sometime. Otherwise, for the price of a few meals here, you could instead buy a cheap flight to Japan.",4,6/17/2018,Momi Nonmi
274,"Good service. Good selection of sake and shozu. Food is ok. I felt it is overpriced for the tiny portions. I don't mind spending some money for a fine dining. However, i think it wasn't satisfied my palate. Salmon sashimi dish had a broth. The broth tasted like a rumune or caloico taste(Japanese sweet drink). Loco moco was something I could make it better with $3 ingredients. I may return for drinks and small snack.",3,6/23/2018,Momi Nonmi
275,"Interesting place. Very attentive and thoughtful staff, we asked if it would be possible to make some dietary additions, chef was consulted and missionaries made excellently - really appreciated that. Excellent sake selection inviting a great one from Niigata. Ordered vegetarian items, liked them all, especially the Zucchini Katsu, green beans and yaki-onigiri. Veggie tempura was also good, daikon tempura was a first (uncommon in traditional Japanese playbooks) and an interesting idea that works!For dessert had a black seseme soymilk panacotta (vegan) with marinated strawberries and lycees. This was excellent.Small but intimate yet izakaya-like atmosphere and size/plating.Bottom line, a very creative Hawaiian-Japanese culinary experience, not something I usually like, but this works very well mainly because of the quality and attention to detail, will return!",4,6/23/2018,Momi Nonmi
276,"MVP of the night: the sake sommelier. My friend and I got flights with our dinner, and each pour came with an amazingly detailed backstory of each type of sake. Never have I learned so much about sake in my entire life. I'd go back just to get more sake stories from that fellow.The food was quite good as well. Everything was interesting and delicious. I can see why small plates work for the this place -- the restaurant itself is cozy and pretty small.",4,7/3/2018,Momi Nonmi
277,"My boyfriend and I had our anniversary dinner here. We were pretty excited!Service was great - it's clear that the servers are very knowledgeable about the menu and flavors of each dish. Hamachi sashimi and the zucchini katsu were yummy, but things went downhill pretty quickly from there.The seafood that Momi Nonmi uses is the cheap pre-frozen, pre-peeled, shrunken, and waterlogged kind you buy at the grocery store when you're on a college budget. The seafood dynamite was full of them, and although masked by the delicious sauce, the seafood tasted like nothing. Same with the rock shrimp tempura. The sauce was simply there to mask the flavorless thawed-out shrimp. The price just doesn't justify the lack of quality in the main ingredients.We were most excited for the wagyu dumplings, but the meat is completely overpowered by ginger. It was tender, but wagyu should taste like beef. It doesn't NEED to be covered up!We also ordered the toro mazemen. The toro was braised in a soy-sauce based broth, to the point where it honestly tasted like canned mackerel. We wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. The noodles were covered in a watery ranch dressing that really threw us off. We couldn't finish it.Come on. Do better. Does the chef simply not care?! You can't expect diners to be fooled by cheap ingredients, especially when you're charging $$$$ for a bite or two per dish. And when you get yourself a great ingredient like wagyu and toro, do it some goddamn justice.",2,7/11/2018,Momi Nonmi
278,Everything from the shishito peppers to the cocktails were perfectly crafted. The staff is knowledgeable and would masterfully recommend the perfect sake or dish.I recommend the edamame hummus and the shishito peppers to start. The wagyu dumplings were fantastic. We had a seared cod special which was great.The place is understated and unpretentious. It delivers interesting food in a cozy ambiance.,5,8/10/2018,Momi Nonmi
279,"Pros: dishes are generally pretty good. They're well presented and taste pretty good. Service is friendly and attentive.Cons: Portions. The industry-wide monkey-see-monkey-do obsession with small plates goes way overboard here where the dishes are literally one bite. It's clear they're trying to maximize their revenues by starving you so that you have to get eight dishes just to feel lightly sated. They're trying to be O-Ya, which is unfortunate. There is a good medium to hit here, I think. Even simple dishes like chicken show up as tiny one bite things. Smdh.",2,10/13/2018,Momi Nonmi
280,"Everything we tried was awesome, I just wasn't expecting the portions to be so small! The waitress let us know the majority of the menu was ""small dishes"" and she recommended we get at least 2 each. We ended up getting the Japanese curry with fried chicken, shokado bento, and the loco moco. Loved the first two; curry was an okay-sized portion, and the shokado bento was filled with little cups filled with different dishes. Perfect if you are indecisive and want to try a little bit of everything (the dishes rotate depending on when you visit). The loco moco was a little ordinary, and such a small portion! Definitely not worth the $16, as it wasn't any super fancy beef either. However, we still had a great time. We came here for my boyfriend's birthday (which I specified on my reservation) and the restaurant staff was kind enough to prepare a birthday card for him and gave us a complementary dessert as well.",4,10/19/2018,Momi Nonmi
281,"Some friends/family and I came in a couple weeks ago after an afternoon of drinking. We walked in and sat right down, no wait at all. Momi Nonmi was the perfect way to end the evening with some delicious, perfectly crafted snacks. We had a few Jumbo Drumsticks, Cheese House fries, Spam Musubi, Spicy Tuna, and a few sake's for the table. Everything was delicious and I for one will definitely be going back.",4,11/6/2018,Momi Nonmi
282,"This is great authentic Japanese food, which is quite rare to find in the Boston area. I strongly recommend the bento box. All ingredients were super fresh. I see people complaining about the portion size, but this is the way Japanese food... I will go back again and would recommend to anyone who is a foodie!",5,11/10/2018,Momi Nonmi
283,"We've been to Momi Nonmi twice, when they first opened and a year later and it definitely deserves 5 stars. The service is knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. The drinks are yummy, the food is very fresh, tasty and unique. If you go there around 9pm, you can take advantage of both menus: the regular dinner menu and the late night menu. Some of my favorite dishes were the tuna tartare, Brussels sprouts, shishitos, wagyu beef dumplings, house fries, popcorn, spam, loco moco, tempura portobellos. It's always a fun night going to Momi Nonmi and I can't wait to go back.",5,11/25/2018,Momi Nonmi
284,"Must Try! I can't say enough good things about Momi Nonmi, they hit every note. Service level is spot on and the food is truly excellent. Every dish was tasty as hell and seasoned to perfection.

The brunch menu is extra special compared to other times of the day, so come for brunch to try this Hawaiian Loco Moco!***My Recommendation Get the Hawaiian Loco Moco! It's fried egg on a beef patty over rice served on a sizzling plate. The server then pours gravy all over it. Perfect way to start your morning! A traditional styled bento box, the shokado bento lets you try different things from Japanese culture while being satiated. They allow reservations, but it is in the area of Cambridge where there's not much to do.IG: @foodisseur",5,11/30/2018,Momi Nonmi

287,"Loved the atmosphere and staff here. The food was exquisite and the knowledgeable wait staff gave us all kinds of interesting information about what we ordered and especially the saki flights, which I highly recommend! Best of all, nearly the entire menu is gluten free! As a celiac it's so nice to be able to enjoy Japanese cuisine without worrying about cross contamination here (they specifically told me there's no cross in the kitchen). The few items that have gluten are marked on the menu but everything else is safe.",5,12/2/2018,Momi Nonmi

Saki Steve shows his guests soooo much love! I have tasted almost everything on this menu.The portions are small, so don't go here expecting a protein with a full side of rice! Beware they have a late night menu which is different from their regular menu. The Seafood Dynamite has been my absolute FAVORITE! And their cocktails are delicious you want to lick the last drop from the cup! Go there and support SAKI STEVE!",5,12/2/2018,Momi Nonmi

290,"I've visited Momi Nonmi a few times now. The dishes are well thought out, the flavor profiles have depth, and the solid sake selection adds to the overall experience. Raku in Las Vegas is my measuring stick for all other izakayas in the United States. Momi has potential, my advice to management would be less is more. Focus on a few areas like robatayaki and less on high end Japanese tapas.",4,1/16/2019,Momi Nonmi
291,"My husband and I love this place. We took our honeymoon in Japan, and the flavors in the bento box  always make us remember that wonderful trip. It's the closest we've been able to get to the real thing in the U.S. The food is delicious and authentic and still manages to be a bit experimental. The staff are friendly and welcoming but not saccharine. The atmosphere is hip but unpretentious. Highly recommend!",5,1/27/2019,Momi Nonmi
292,"We went here last night for dinner and enjoyed our meal. Small plates are always fun because you get a nice variety of flavors, and this was no exception.The roasted brussels sprouts were our favorite dish, hands-down. They were pulled apart so there were lots of edges to get crispy, and came with roasted shallots and a butternut squash puree, along with a sweet-savory sauce that made it just perfect. I could eat these every day.We got the tuna poke two ways, which was tasty. I preferred the Chef's way (with a tarter and more refreshing sauce) while my husband preferred the traditional way (more umami flavor). Quality of the tuna was good.The bay scallops with butternut squash were kind of a let-down. The scallops themselves had little flavor, and while the crispy tofu skin garnish was good and the butternut sauce was excellent, the dish as a whole was only mediocre. The low point of the meal.The nanban chicken (spicy pineapple glaze) had tons of flavor, with the tartness, sweetness, and spice balancing perfectly. We really enjoyed this one, though you definitely need to have it with rice or the heat may be too much for some.The short rib skewers were perfectly cooked and very savory, but they didn't stand out as being special.The Kalua pork onigiri came out last, and it was fine-- tasty, nice balance of flavors, but not a standout either.Finally, we got the raindrop dessert, which I'd been looking forward to. It was kind of tough to eat because it was served on a flat tray with no rim to push the slippery gel against to get it on your spoon, but it had an authentically Japanese flavor. The serving size is just enough to get the idea of the dessert, without actually having much substance.Overall, we had a good meal and were satisfied between the two of us with the dishes we'd ordered. I can see this place as being perfect for a group having drinks and heavy snacks to share! Special points go to our waiter, who was extremely knowledgeable about all of the dishes and the sake selection, and was happy to talk about the ingredients and cooking techniques in a way that was informative but not condescending or pushy.",4,1/30/2019,Momi Nonmi
293,"An upscale Japanese tapas spot off the beaten path in Cambridge. Overall: 4/5Value: 4/5Food: 3.75/5 Service: 5/5Decor: 5/5We came for lunch on a Sunday, and ordered the bento box x3, uni cup, dessert flight and raindrop cake. The uni cup ($21) was expensive and somewhat small for the price but absolutely delectable - rich and creamy Maine uni offset by sushi rice with a bit of sauce seasoning. Fairly nicely presented, although the uni was more brown than orange in color (could just be the nature of Maine uni?).  The bento box ($29) is stunning - very visually appealing and it's great to be able to try many different dishes. As a whole it was pretty good, but at several of the dishes disappointed a bit - for example, salmon over sushi rice did not have any seasoning or soy sauce on the side. The cold poached egg with ikura also seemed a bit lacking given the price of the bento. The toro tartare was standout, as was the Spanish mackerel. A lot of the dishes are cold so if you prefer hot dishes perhaps the other sets are a better choice. The gyu don was also a bit cold, and I would have preferred it to be hot. Overall I think it's a nice concept but also one could argue its not that cohesive because it's comprised of small dishes, mostly whatever is in season and what the chef has made. The desserts were a bit more disappointing. The raindrop cake was pretty but a small portion for the price ($7-8). The dessert flight ($8) comprised of 1/2 a mochi which was good, as well as a unique yuzu sake ice cream, and a matcha chocolate cake which was dry. Overall it's a nice experience but quite pricey - our lunch for 3 came out to $134 without tip. Perhaps worth a try for the experience of the bento but come in expecting premium prices.",4,2/24/2019,Momi Nonmi
294,"My bf and I wanted to come here cause 1. Extrapetite said it was her favorite place and 2. It was a very unique restaurant based on atmosphere and food. They have omakase on the menu but it's not entirely a sushi restaurant. It's more of a general Japanese restaurant. Service was good. We got there in time for regular menu and late night menu (starts around 9:45pm). We ordered 7 things and it came out to be $98 with tax and tip. I forgot to take a picture of the salmon sashimi which was my favorite dish due to the mustard sauce (which didn't really taste like mustard) but paired really well with the radish and slightly seared salmon. I also loved the carrots and parsnips in the vinegarette sauce. The spam mushubi (late night menu) and the seared sawara weren't rememberable. I would come back again maybe one more time just to try almost everything else on the menu. Edit: After I went home, I had some soy milk my sister gave me and I threw up...3 times. I can't tell if it was the food at the restaurant or the soy milk that caused it. I'm sad cause I don't think I'd come back just cause I'm scared. But I did really enjoy the food when I was there. Also my bf did not throw up and he did not have soy milk so maybe it was the milk or I just ate a specifically bad piece of meat or fish.",4,3/3/2019,Momi Nonmi
295,"If you're going to drop money on food you want to know that you're getting good value and this place delivers! We did the Omakaze (basically a fixed price set of small plates ranging from 5-7 with varying prices between $55-77 depending on the food offered that night) and added the sake pairings. And then we just sat back, enjoyed the ambiance, and indulged. Our waiter was great and gave us just the right amount of info about the sakes and dishes he served and explained why they went together. The dishes themselves (tonkatsu broth soup, toro sashimi special, caviar okonomiyaki special, scallops and brussel sprouts, and duck and crispy rice ball) were superb. They were so creative and the flavors and textures worked really well- especially factoring in the complementary sake. We got different little cups for each one- so cute. The meal was over in 70 minutes which worked for our timeline but if you're getting a several course meal you might expect to be there 2hrs- don't. They have a small restaurant and turned several parties away while we sat there because they had reservations to honor (MAKE A RESERVATION) and just not that much space. So, fill your belly and make room for the next eater. Bathroom was tidy and more spacious than expected. Service was terrific and I loved our waiter. I can't wait to introduce friends to this gem of a restaurant!",5,3/16/2019,Momi Nonmi
296,"Small, but cute Japanese izakaya in East Cambridge. Some friends and I made a dinner reservation for a Saturday night right around opening. The waitress recommended that we order 3-4 dishes per person. However, I wasn't up for such a big appetite that day and opted for two dishes (yakitori onigiri, $9 and spicy tuna tartare, $12). They both had good flavor - The tartare came with this rice cracker that I wasn't a huge fan of and came more as a spread consistency. The onigiri wasn't anything over the edge, the usual rice ball with chicken wrapped in seaweed. The food was good, but hard to justify for the price. My experience would've been fine based on food alone, but from the get-go, I very much felt pressured to order more. The waitress insisted most people order the 3-4/per and came around multiple times asking if we wanted to put in additional orders of food or drinks. We very much felt pushed and ended up wanting to get out of there ASAP.From all the other good reviews and pictures, I'm still enticed to try their bentos for lunch. However, this experience alone wasn't the best for what it was.",3,3/18/2019,Momi Nonmi
297,"Good bento box for lunch. We made mistake to not make reservation. So we waited quite long time to get a table, then waited more for the food. The bento was on the smaller size, but favor is good. We also got the tuna bowl to share. Will come back again for dinner.",5,3/24/2019,Momi Nonmi
298,"Made a reservation at 12pm when they just opened, we were 20 minutes late due to traffic. When we got there, it was empty, we can seat anywhere we want. Not much selection for Saturday brunch... I wish there are appetizers just like the dinner menu. We ordered the uni cup as a starter with the shokado bento and shaved beef bento. Uni cup definitely my favorite, creamy and sweet with the rice and fish roe. For shokado, it hard to say what's good or not because is the chef's choice and most of them is from the night menu (just small size) and the shaved beef was okay but alittle salty at end even I mixed it with my rice. I wish they have short rib instead shaved beef. The miso soup taste differ from other Japanese restaurants. For dessert, we ordered the raindrop which I am not a fan but my friend enjoyed it but the complained is it can get messy. For me, it tate like medicine... hopefully I have chance to come back for their dinner menu.",4,3/30/2019,Momi Nonmi
299,"A cosy, stylish small plates place with great atmosphere. We got personalized service from Stephan, the young sake programme manager (who knew there was such a thing).  It is a little pricey but you can see how much effort and care goes into the food and drink as well as presentation. You may not be a brussels sprouts fan but their's were really outstanding.",5,3/31/2019,Momi Nonmi
300,"I have been here for 3/4 times already, and we always get the shokda bento box and we always enjoyed it. They used to include different varieties such as sashimi, ceviche, cooked fish, and fried chicken etc. I was quite disappointed today. Yes i did mentioned that its lent friday, and i can eat everything except for meat and my partner was fine with the normal bento box which usually include the fried chicken.Well i guess they dropped our bento boxes before they could make it to our table and they had to remake it. We didnt mind waiting for the food as we know it would take some time. My partner and i end up getting the same bento boxes i guess the chef didnt want to make different dishes for us. The bento box below, we had 4 rice dishes out of 9. Disappointed that the chef couldnt be more creative. We felt like this wasnt worth the money this time.Bento box- left to right.One piece of sushi with fish, rice rolled up w tobiko egg, rice with some surf clams thinly sliced, rice with 3 thin slices of salmon, cooked salmon, rice with vegetable curry, japanese egg w vegetable, rice with chopped tuna, and canned tuna.",2,4/19/2019,Momi Nonmi
301,"I had been wanting to try Momi Nonmi for a while after hearing all the positive buzz surrounding it. Given Boston's slim pickings for well-executed Japanese food, my s/o and I were more than willing to make the trek to Cambridge to try the brunch omakase. We arrived at 12:45 pm, and the cozy restaurant already had three groups. The brunch menu had four options, and the baller brunch omakase sounded appetizing despite the off color name. Toro, premium sashimi and onigiri? Can't go wrong, right? WRONG. The omakase started off promising with an appetizer with a marinated soft boiled egg and radish steeped in a wonderful tonkatsu broth that was the perfect balance of umami flavors. Yum. Most omakase places usually start off with lighter appetizers, but that's cool. The second course was three tiny samplers consisting of mere slivers of sea bream sitting on a bed of Napa cabbage, toro marinated in ponzu and an aggressive splash of soy sauce that made everything a touch too salty, and something else that was unmemorable with bean sprouts. This was when everything went downhill. The third course was two saucer-sized okonomiyaki with roe and a dressing. The okonomiyaki was composed of a bland mix of shredded cabbage that lacked texture and the overall consistency of the pancake was unremarkable. The fourth course was a Japanese curry with asparagus, Japanese squash, celery, however, it tasted no different than ""Vermont Curry"".... yeah, the store-bought kind. The last course was two strips of pork katsu on a small bed of rice. While the last two courses tasted fine, it felt disjointed from the rest of the meal, almost like it was haphazardly thrown together to fill up the remaining courses. I get that Momi Nonmi is not a sushi restaurant, but the omakase was positioned as toro, premium sashimi, onigiri so I'm not sure where the disconnect is as 80% of our meal had nothing to do with that description. The meal itself took just over 1.5 hours for five courses, and we noticed a significant slowdown in the pacing of our meal after course two, when another couple came in and ordered the omakase; it seems like the chef decided it would be best if they aligned the timing of our courses with the other table, even though they started after us. Logistically, I suppose it makes sense for the food preparation, HOWEVER, this led to long periods of idling for our table. Our server Steve acknowledged the long wait and explained it was due to the ""lunch rush"" and promised that they would be ""ramping up the last few courses"". Which didn't really happen. We waited nearly 20+ minutes between each course and by then the restaurant was not busy and the courses weren't complex enough to warrant the wait time. If the food had been worth the wait, then I suppose the extended wait could be justified, but alas, it was not. Overall, the execution of the meal fell flat and the value wasn't quite there.",2,4/19/2019,Momi Nonmi
302,"Looking for late nite eats with relaxing & cozy setting, along with contemporary food & friendly service? If you're in town & Cambridge area, look no further!

303,"I got the bento box at Momi nonmi. Visually incredibly pleasing and phenomenally great tasting! You get 9 delicious small plates for you to try whichhhh adds up to being quite filling. Each uniquely tasting and visually appealing. And the toro is to die for!If you are a type of person that likes tasting different dishes, or even just delicious well made Japanese food then I highly recommend trying the bento box during Momi nonmi's lunch hours. The atmosphere is also incredible, very relaxing and cozy restaurant. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. a perfect spot for a nice Japanese lunch date or a hangout with a few friends.Highly recommended to come here!",5,4/26/2019,Momi Nonmi
304,Outstanding Japanese food with a Hawaiian flair. I try to go to Momi Nonmi as often as possible. There are many choices and there is something there for everyone. The dishes are very creative and Chris Chung uses the best ingredients. He is an expert and one of the best in the field.,5,5/10/2019,Momi Nonmi
305,"We tried the omakase brunch set which has 5 courses. I general, I feel like the chef wants to combine Japanese cuisine and Hawaii/ American style together. However, it tries to combine the material but the chef is not successful in making all the flavor in a harmony. For example, the fourth course is fish and lobster dumpling with curry source. The staff said there was some cheese, truffle inside the lobster dumplings. It had a really strong taste, like lamb. The taste is special and also the combination is special, I will give it that. However, I could no longer taste the lobster itself. In addition, with curry as the source, it is too overwhelming that it lost all the flavor of the food itself. I think Japanese cuisine likes to keep the original flavor of the material and makes it shine. The ""new"" combination fails in that. The other dish is the okonomiyaki with caviar. I don't like it when the chef just tries to made the dish fancier by adding caviar or truffle. There is no harmony in the taste of the food. The second dish is toro sashimi. I like the sauce but I honestly don't think they have good quality of the toro itself. Japanese is really meticulous about the quality of the sashimi. If you like trying new combinations of material, you should definitely go to the restaurant. However, if you want to have authentic Japanese food/Hawaii food, I don't recommend.",3,5/11/2019,Momi Nonmi
306,"what a gem of a new restaurant!  (may be I shouldn't write this because I prefer to keep the restaurant a secret.)I tried the bento box lunch and wow, was I in for a treat!  A sleek, modern japanese presentation with flavors that pop in your mouth from one mini-dish to another.   Lobster sauce with poached egg.  House-prepared salmon on rice that makes me re-think how all salmon should be prepared!  Agadashi tofu so delicately crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   The 9 items on the box was perfect for my ADHD.  I can start on one dish and then wimpsically jump to another, and then another.   I brought friends back for dinner because lunch was so good.  started with the seasonal saki that is made with strawberry blossom from a special vineyard in Japan.   super yummy and smooth.   I love the small plates format because it is so much fun to share dishes with your friends.  that is how all good meals should be.   Out with the traditional format where each person orders your own dish! Just added to the menu was a new mushroom dynamite dish that was awesome.  It was reduced in the oven in aioli until it gave an intense flavor.   apparently the way it was prepared was inspired by the chef's upbringing in Hawaii.    the tempura batter was very delicate and all the different sauces were a great way to get your taste-buds firing. The sashimi dishes (had three different ones, one house-cured fatty tuna toro, and one hamachi) were all so mouth-watering that I kept taking one piece after another.   I felt guilty because for sure I had a few extra pieces than my friends.   All this was enhanced by our friendly server Steve, who was super-knowledgeable, tell-you-like-it-is, attentive, appropriate.   Our table loved him.",5,6/2/2019,Momi Nonmi

308,"Momi Nonmi was certainly an unique experience. We came in for a Saturday lunch. The interior is cozy and intimate. Sitting at the bar meant we could chat to the servers as they came by. In general, the food felt very light, but certainly didn't leave us hungry. I ordered the bento box. It comes with 9 small portions of different items. It was a great chance to try a variety of options. I really liked the fish dishes. The tuna tartare for example was very tasty. However, I felt like the vegetable items were exceptional. They were very different than vegetable dishes that you find in other restaurants. I also tried the shaved spare ribs. The meat was savory and curiously sweet. The miso soup was interesting. It has a fish base which was almost overwhelming to everything else in the soup.Finally for dessert we tried the raindrop, which was very unique and I'd highly recommend trying it at least once.",5,6/18/2019,Momi Nonmi

We (okay I) got the Bento box and my boyfriend got the special for the day, which was a Toro donburi. The bento box consisted of 9 small dishes, which is presently very aesthetically. Perfect for your photo needs. It's enough to fill you up. Not all of them were hits, since I don't like pickled veggies or cooked seaweed. But I did have a few favorites. The short rib stew was super flavorful and packed with meaty goodness. The mini toro rice bowl was also delicious and fresh. The cod was SOOO flavorful with crisp skin, I could have eaten just this and been very pleased. They also included another stew with a fried shrimp which was fried to perfection. I ate it, tail and all. The toro rice bowl was also good. The fish was super flavorful and they gave quite a bit of it! It was exactly how they described, fresh fish and rice lol. That's it. It makes sense, but I thought it would come with something else I guess. However the star of the meal was definitely the bento because of the huge variety of dishes. This place is a little pricey for brunch. But if you consider that you're getting fresh fish for brunch, it evens out!",4,7/22/2019,Momi Nonmi

You can tell that there's a lot of detail that goes into the process here. We also got the raindrop cake, which I saw online and was really interested in trying but it was pretty disappointing. No real flavor to the cake or the sides that accompanied it, and it was a little 'deflated' looking.All in all a cool place that is worth a try.",4,8/6/2019,Momi Nonmi
314,"Service was great. Our server was very attentive and helpful. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated. The food, however, was not up to par. My friend and I each ordered a lunch, mine with shrimp and his the shredded short rib, which comes with rice, miso soup, and fried tofu. My shrimp was okay, nothing special, a little unexciting and bland. The miso soup wasn't right - it was too strong in flavor and almost had a meaty flavor. The rice was so dry, almost as if it was left on the counter for too long. The fried tofu though was A M A Z I N G. Such a small portion but very delicious and delicate. Overall I'm glad I didn't choose the chirashi or the 9 box bento. Not a very satisfying meal. Disappointed but at least the presentation is pretty, right.....?",3,8/7/2019,Momi Nonmi

Food: the food was fabulous, with super different types recipes and have a really cool twist. The chef managed to take general Japanese or Hawaiian foods and elevate them making the dishes individually unique. Even the chicken skewers, the most basic thing that we got, was incredible. My favourite was their sashimi... super fresh and each had something new and a cool twist.Service: the food was fast. We went at 6:30, and were out by 7:45... and that's post lingering after dessert. It was definitely a restaurant that was a bit more expensive.... each dish averaged at a price of about 8-15$ and you needed about 6-7 things for 2 people ?

The waiter was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. You could tell that the team really prided themselves on their work and had put a lot of effort into make the menu and even the sake flight that paired with it. Each dish was beautifully crafted and blew me away time and time again. They were all so complex and intricate. Eating the different components separately and together as they were meant to be eaten was fun to see how everything melded together. My favorite was the duck breast which was so tender and still held all the flavors a duck should. The most special thing about this dish was the strawberries. I have never tasted anything like it before. And they somehow paired perfectly with the duck. The brussel sprouts completed the dish perfectly and added a nice crunch. I hope to be back again but it was definitely pricey. All in all a wonderful experience.",5,10/12/2019,Momi Nonmi

320,"For the price, I don't think it's anything special. It's not bad or anything; the dishes were tasty, and they used pretty high quality ingredients. However, I would only pay this price for something spectacular, and this was not. If this was a highly coveted restaurant, or if the ingredients or preparation was special, or if there is some sort of selling point, then it would make sense... But this is just a regular, small Japanese-inspired (or fusion?) restaurant. It's pretty far out from the city, and the interior is not especially nice.. so it just does not justify the price. A $200 dinner for 2 people can get me at least a 10-12 course omakase meal for 2 in the Greater Boston Area, but at Momi Nonmi, it was only enough for 5 small dishes. The 5 dishes we got here was about the same portion size, quality, ingredients, etc of 5 courses of a nice omakase meal, so we were still hungry at the end of the meal. We just didn't want to order anything else here. We came for the toro flight, but we also got the agedashi tofu with truffle, ""loco moco"" (rice, beef, gravy, and egg on a sizzling plate), (a very salty) cucumber seaweed salad, and ""raindrop"" dessert. The toro and tofu were specials not on the menu, and I think they change it once a week. The restaurant was relatively empty on a Monday night, but the waiter was very friendly. The chef also came out for some of the dishes, like grating the truffle, but it's not like service was amazingly spectacular.

There are three levels of Omakase, we ordered the $200 version, which came with 15 fantastic courses and definitely left us feeling very full. The chef provided a very organized printed outline of the courses with matching numbers on each small to-go box in the order so we could follow along easily. We also ordered the spam musubi and waygu dumplings, which was almost too much food, but sounded too good to pass up and we're certainly very happy we ordered them as they were delicious. We happened to have a bottle of Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc on hand, which paired perfectly with the food.

We love traditional nigiri sushi. We are not fans of rolls. I came across a write up in the Globe about Chef Chris' omakase specials and knew we had to try it. We had a subpar anniversary celebration in December so we decided for a redo and went all out with the premium omakase dinner. Wow, just wow. Everything was so fresh and delicious and Chef Chris' creations were really creative and spectacular. I hope that sushi stays on the menu when this pandemic is over because Chef Chris is really talented and knowledgeable. One word of advice, come HUNGRY.

Friends and I came here for omakase during COVID restrictions, which meant that we had the entire restaurant for indoor seating to ourselves at the time. I'm not sure if that's still the rule but it was pretty awesome to essentially have a private chef situation. The chef, by the way, is clearly incredibly knowledgeable and thoughtful about food, but also is incredibly kind and hard working! We had to pre-order the meal we wanted and gave our preferences. We did all of that via instagram which was fine. There were different price levels as well.Now for the food: yes! It was unlike any meal I had ever had. It was delicious. I can hardly explain it. The sushi was incredibly fresh and, yes, delicious. The other dishes was so good. My favorite dish was a lightly poached egg with salmon roe in a strawberry yeast sake. I can't even explain how good this was. The meal ended with a miso caramel ice cream that was quite possibly the best ice cream we had ever had. We even tried to convince the chef to sell it by the pint!Overall, yes it's worth it!",5,1/28/2021,Momi Nonmi

We felt super safe during entire dining service. As for the food, everything was super fresh and delicious. Highly recommend!",5,2/7/2021,Momi Nonmi
336,"The omakase experience from Chef Chris is a truly special, unique, and delicious experience. My husband and I came for a private sitting during COVID and it was an amazing and safe way to celebrate my birthday. The menu changes every day but every dish was so fresh, delicate, and delicious. I can't speak highly enough of the food and experience and can't wait to order take out and return in the future.",5,2/14/2021,Momi Nonmi
337,"Wow! Because of Covid, Momi Nonmi is offering private omakase experiences which my friend and I had the pleasure of trying! We ordered the Premium Nigiri Omakase which started with three appetizers and was followed by 18 pieces of nigiri! Every course was spectacular and unique. The fish quality was outstanding and truly one of the best omakase experiences in Boston. The fish is truly highlighted and the flavors are balanced perfectly. The rice was also really good (best I've had in Boston). Make sure to come here and support them- you won't be disappointed!",5,3/11/2021,Momi Nonmi
338,"A bit overrated esp for the attitude you'll get when dealing with them with the terrible online menu layout and the impersonablenees of the front door person on pickup, maybe that's the chef not really sure. It's sort of the same ingredients all around just used in different dishes, kind of boring tbh and they refuse to budge on the price so have it a couple chances but nope won't be going back",2,3/26/2021,Momi Nonmi
339,"We had a lovely Omakase here for my husband's birthday. Chef was very friendly and made delicious nigiri with unusual and fancy fish. We really enjoyed our experience, thank you.",5,3/31/2021,Momi Nonmi
340,"Boston is not known for its sushi. I've been disappointed by tons of Japanese restaurants and most of them get over 4 stars on Yelp. The quality of fish was not even comparable to a food court nested in a Japanese grocery store. So it took me two years to finally try an omakase since I relocated here. However, after our omakase (premium nigiri omakase) with Chef Chris, he broke the entrenched stereotype by his impeccable OG sushi expertise and the best cut of the high quality fish! The premium nigiri omakase experience contained 3 apps + 16-18 nigiris + 1 light dessert. It's not even possible to pick my favorite one since every piece is perfect in a different way. I quite disagree with another review commenting that this is not a place for traditional sushi. I would say, if you are a fun of traditional nigiri without fancy toppings that may ruin the unique umami of the fish itself, you should definitely come and visit Chef Chris.First, the chef knows his fish, that skill seems basic but requires some gift and years of experience which some other NYC Michelin chef may not be capable of. The way you process the fish will make a huge difference by downgrading vs enhancing the unique flavor of various fish. Second, the chef sticked with red vinegar (or a mix of red and white) to season the rice that tastes richer however smoother and full of umami. That paired well with how he processed the fish. Third, I like the perfect fish/rice ratio. You will see less rice here. The flavor of fish will be overwhelmed by too much rice. In that case the sharpness from vinegar will turn out to dominate everything in your mouth. We cannot find any piece as a miss among all. My favorite ones are the chef's kiss and grilled toro (and some white fish I cannot remember their names). My husband's favorites are New Zealand king salmon and the grilled toro. I did not take pictures as I prefer to eat sushi at its best temperature. But I will definitely come back for another omakase experience. Thank you Chef Chris~",5,6/24/2021,Momi Nonmi
341,"For the omakase - it's very expensive for what it is and the nigiri runs on the slightly smaller side. The ambience was also strange probably because of COVID, and we also were given all of our nigiri in literally 10 mins. High quality ingredients and they're expertly sourced but it was a very rushed meal that also felt a bit awkward due to the space and service, which is a shame for what was supposed to be a luxe dining experience. Not many options in Boston tbh so probably will stick to omakase in NYC, SF or LA in the future.",3,9/21/2021,Momi Nonmi
342,"This was our last attempt to try sushi in Boston... Chef is very very nice and works really hard. And this might be very good for Boston standards... However, Boston is officially sushi desert for me now ... I am gonna stop trying ....",3,11/2/2021,Momi Nonmi
343,"There has not been a better meal had in my five years living in Boston. What began as my wife and I hesitating to walk into the very quiet, basically empty restaurant, ended in 18 memorable courses, guided by the endearing Chef Chris. We learned Chef keeps the headcount down, as he is running both back and front of the house, to ensure attention to detail and customer experience. What may be lacking in ambiance, we were the only customers there, was totally overwhelmed by plate after plate of perfection. We chose the standard omakase, which combines both hot and cold small plates, followed by sashimi and nigiri. Paired with a stellar bottle of Sake, every bite of food was terrific. While expensive, the price is totally worth the experience. I've tried a number of other sushi restaurants in Boston, many of which are excellent. The truth is, they have all been leap frogged by Chef Chris at Momi Nonmi. I cannot wait to go back, next time with some friends to share the experience.",5,2/9/2022,Momi Nonmi
344,"If we could give this amazing treasure of a resturant another star we would. The food was absolutely amazing, and the chef so incredibly talented. Each piece of sushi was super fresh and the chef created some unique sauces to compliment each piece. He took time to explain every detail that went into making this exceptional experience. Can't wait to return soon--truly a fantastic dinner",5,3/13/2022,Momi Nonmi
345,One of the best omakase experiences. Chef Chris does a great job explaining every piece of excellently curated fish and doesn't cut any corners. 10/10 would recommend.,5,4/29/2022,Momi Nonmi
346,"I really enjoyed the unique omakase experience from this place. You have to make reservations ahead so definitely plan accordingly, as the chef orders his fish based on what ""tier"" you reserve. We went with the premium! Every cut of fish was so fresh and delicious!!! It's a small place and Chef Chris makes every piece of fish right in front of you. He does this while explaining each piece and making it a personable experience. With the limited omakase options in Boston, this one definitely is worth trying!",4,6/14/2022,Momi Nonmi
347,"One of, if not the best Omakase in Boston. Chef Chris is very knowledgeable and passionate about sushi and it shows. Great progression of menu, creative, great selection of in season product. Great sake menu. The items you come for, you will get and love but you will end up being surprised and loving something unexpected like his homemade tofu. I recommend splurging and getting one of the bigger Omakase menus so you can see his range and creativity.",5,6/18/2022,Momi Nonmi
348,Went in for pick up order.  No line still 5 min before he acknowledged me and said he would grab my food.  Waited 10 more minutes and he still had not gone to get the food so I left. Not happy.,1,6/29/2022,Momi Nonmi
349,"We had a great experience.   Chef Chris took the time to explain each dish, which was prepared with extremely fresh fish and fresh Wasabi.  Great experience,  I would certainly return.",5,7/3/2022,Momi Nonmi
350,"Came here for an anniversary dinner, and Chef Chris went above and beyond what I even knew was possible for a dining experience. Chef Chris reached out via email to confirm reservation, also provided a sake list (both bottles that we ordered were delightful), as well as asked about our favorite pieces of sushi, all of which he incorporated into our meal.All parts of our meal were excellent, starters down to the final pieces of nigiri. Selections included toro, uni, salmon, and so much more. Intimate explanations of each course, which make for a great experience. Truly a fantastic meal. Pricey options (premium nigiri and two bottles of sake plus tip came to $550+) but I've never experienced an instance where paying this premium was worth it without a shred of a doubt. Thank you Chef Chris!",5,7/26/2022,Momi Nonmi
351,"I came here late April to take my fiance (at the time) for an omakase dinner. We were the only customers, so we had the full on experience with Chef Chris. It was a great experience.The place was intimate, and you felt like Chef Chris was giving us a show. The food was phenomenal, and he offered a great selection of sake. Before dining, Chef Chris asked what are some favorite pieces of sushi, and he incorporated them in our meal. He also provided great sake recommendations throughout the experience.The place can add up in terms of $$$, but you get what you pay for: an intimate journey that your tastebuds will forever appreciate.",5,9/18/2022,Momi Nonmi
352,"A cozy restaurant located on Cambridge street in Cambridge. A small bar area for seating and a bunch of tables that can be made for small and larger groups. On a Saturday night, it was busy but not full. The wait staff was polite and helpful. Provided explanation to the dishes, menu and good recommendations. Ginza G + T was a typical gin and tonic. Strong and classicToro flight - was the nightly special so pricy at $28. 4 different cuts of toro. The best was the fatty fish as the other prices were more 'tougher' and resembled beef. Uni and rock crab hand roll - also a nightly special. Lots of rock crab and sufficient amount of uni. Probably one of the best dish of the night Kanpachi- good flavor with the pineapple sauce. Fish was thinly sliced Hien bronzini - not a typical fish on sushi menu so worth a try. Felt the sesame oil drenched the fish and overwhelmed the dish. Kalua pork onigiri- great presentation and loved that you had to wrap it yourself. Lots of filling - a plus. The pork was flavorfulSpam musubi- ate this at the end so was getting full. The spam was way too small for the amount of rice.  The proportion was way off. Definitely had better elsewhere. Short rib grilled skewers - did not come with skewers and there was no bone attached to the meat. This was nice. The flavor was good with lots of ponzu but meat seems dry. Usually short rib is a bit tender being close to the bone. Waygu beef dumplings- soup dumpling with 5 pieces. Soup was good. The dumplings weren't bad, maybe a bit dry since it was boiled. This cut of meat is better to be eaten seared, grilled instead. Loco moco - befwas tender and maybe a little undercooked. The egg was perfect and the sizzling aspect is a great presentation. Rice wasn't sticky enough to keep the shape from becoming a hot delicious mess. The general comment About the rice is that it's not sticky enough to hold the add on. Overall a great experience at Momi nonmi. Really liked the unique dishes.",4,9/26/2022,Momi Nonmi
353,"Innovative, beautifully presented tapa style dishes. It's an intimate, trendy spot with small tables and a bar area. Perfect for a date night or a cozy dinner with friends. The portions are small so it gives you the opportunity to try more of the dishes. My favorite was the kafta and my table mates raved about the lamb chops.",5,10/20/2016,Moona
354,"We were very excited to try this new place which apparently still has a soft opening through Monday. Through their instagram account, we were able to make a reservation through RESY and receive 20% off our meal. Ideally I would give this place a 3.5 rating and I feel too bad leaving a 3, so a 4 it is! I realize it is new, still in the soft opening phase, but for the prices per small plate, I was really hoping for some flavor. Here's the breakdown:General: The recommendation is 2-3 small plates per person between cold and hot mezze. A few entrees are available as well. Don't know what merguez is? No worries- there is a glossary of terms provided at the bottom of the menu. A dessert menu is also available.Drinks: Yelp says they are full bar, but it is limited to beer and wine. The two cocktails listed are wine-based (vermouth and lillet blanc). They do have red and white sangria on the menu. Our waitress was not able to answer general questions about different wine, but both reds we had were very good.Bread: We were served a tray with pita bread and a grilled white bread. The pita was underwhelming and the grilled white bread was a bit burnt. The accompanying olive oil was delicious and the molasses butter was more subtle than I had hoped.Dips: We did the 3 for $12, trying the Zalouk (eggplant), Labneh & beet, and hummus. The Zalouk was yummy and the Labneh was on point. The hummus: not my favorite. A little lumpy and lacking flavor.Pickles: We tried the Persian Cucumbers and Turnips. Barely ate the turnips, but loved the nuanced heat provided by the Persian Cucumbers.Mezze: We were excited to try the artichoke (as well as other diners around us), but were disappointed that even upon their opening time of 5:30, they were ""out"". Instead, we ordered the short ribs, scallops, kofta, and lamb chops. Short ribs melted to the touch of a fork, but lacked some flavor that I can't put my finger on. The scallops looked beautiful, but had a strong seafood taste to them again lacking some developed flavor. The kofta, though it had delicious flavor, was the hardest to cut kofta I have ever experienced in my life. Our favorite: the lamb chops. Perfectly cooked and heightened with the provided small smear of pistachio butter.Dessert: Bird's nest, I think coined Kunafa: ricotta stuffed shredded phyllo dough baked to perfection with a small provided pour of simple syrup. Easily in our top 2 of the night.There are some high notes and some very underwhelming notes at this new restaurant. For now, I would go back for some wine, lamb chops, and that delicious dessert. Service was a bit clunky with a potential new to food service waitress, but I expect those nuances to be worked out. Worth a try for some small bites and yummy dessert if you're in the area!",4,10/23/2016,Moona
355,"Me & my boyfriend stopped by Friday night since we live across the street! Small cozy restaurant. Small portions dishes which makes you want to try more but they're worth it. My favorite dips are the Muhammara & the hummus. For cold Mezza, i love the Istanbul Vine leaves, warm mezza, i love the Brussel Sprouts, Breewat & scallops. For a fooder like myself, what i love most about this restaurant is that, it tempts you to try all that deliciousness!!.....Now on another note. Although we did have a reservation, they were still running behind on tables & we had to wait quite a while BUT being a small/new restaurant, i understood that they might have some kinks to work out which i'm sure they will. Thankfully we were able to order some drinks at the bar while doing so. The hostess was very welcoming, sympathetic in regards of the wait & kept us informed, she gets two thumbs up from me!!. To top it off, at the end of our meal, she was kind enough to offer us a complimentary dessert (The Kunafe) which i must say was an amazing dessert. Definitely will go back again!! :-) CONGRATS again on your opening!!!",5,11/1/2016,Moona
356,"I tried Moona with some friends during the soft opening and we loved it! It has a warm ambience with great colors, lighting and cool music. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful. But the best part was the food.  We tried a couple of dips - Labneh (a strained yogurt) with beets, Batata and Toum (whipped potatoes and garlic) with Persian cucumber pickles and olives. They were all yummy but the Labneh was my favorite - creamy and rich, plus I'd never had it with beets before - an interesting combo.  The octopus was my favorite warm mezza - I'd never had it so nicely grilled before; it's a must try! Also loved the Brussel sprouts. They do them with a tahini sauce, pine nuts and berries - pretty unique and scrumptious. Scallops with pumpkin sauce and fried leeks were to die for - so buttery.The dessert menu is short but worth it. They have specially made ice creams that are really special. I'd go for the Sahlab and the preserved lemon. I expected the lemon to be super tart but it was creamy and subtle - really unexpected and so good!I've only been once but can't wait to go back.",5,11/3/2016,Moona
357,This is great food. Fantastic flavors and perfectly prepared. The staff was welcoming and very knowledgeable and helpful. I would urge you to go and have a good time. You have not had food like this in the greater Boston area.,5,11/5/2016,Moona
358,"Went to Moona for their soft opening, the menu of small Eastern Mediterranean food has so much variety that I wanted everythinggg. My friend is allergic to pine nuts so that limited some choices, and what I loved about the menu is how they kept their authenticity with the correct terms and added a glossary at the bottom that explains terms of some items not everyone would know right away. It made ordering so much easier and I'm sure saved the waitstaff some questions.Speaking of waitstaff, I wasn't really impressed by the service unfortunately. I didn't feel like they were super engaged in assisting us and would always try and take our dishes before we finished. These are small plates so I'm going to eat every single bit, but whenever they asked if we were finished I felt like I was being rushed to leave. Another reason for less stars on the review would be that the bathroom didn't have a sign. For being such a small space, I couldn't tell if the bathroom was the door to a closet or another room, but luckily the hostess pointed it out to me. Foodwise, I loved everything and I still have so many dishes I want to try! We got the lettuces fattoush salad, grilled octopus, kafta, and short ribs. For dessert we got the chocolate cake and drinks we got the morrocan tea mojito and orange blossom lemonada (both non-alcoholic and both delicious heh). All the small plates were unique in their own way but didn't overpower any of the other dishes we got. The one that fell short would probably be the dessert; not sure if I was a huge fan of the pudding ice cream.",4,11/7/2016,Moona
359,"Great place!Cozy restaurant with great food. Everything we tried was delicious, we especially liked the Kafta. The service was also very good.  Highly recommended!",5,11/13/2016,Moona
360,Happened to drop in today after an afternoon at Inman oasis next door. The food and service were amazing. I would highly recommend the scallops and the full sea bass. Both dishes really stood out both in flavor and texture. They have a great rotating wine and beer list that offered a little something different from the norm. Overall a great experience and I would definitely go there again,5,11/15/2016,Moona
361,"In a word, lovely.  They use Resy, which I prefer over Open Table, so that's neat.  Greeted as soon as we walked in and were sat immediately.  Staff is definitely new and definitely still in learning stages, but they did just fine.Wine list is solid -- by the glass options cover all of the bases and will satisfy wine nerds and casual drinkers alike.  Any place that pours La Stoppa by the glass gets a thumbs up from yours truly.  Food is immensely satisfying, well proportioned, and well priced -- we thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered, which isn't something I can say every time I go out to eat.  If you're only ordering mezze, two-per seems to be the sweet spot.Will be back for sure.",4,11/16/2016,Moona
362,"So nice to have an additional restaurant in the neighborhood that provides wonderful modern middle eastern cuisine. Currently serving only wine ( I think ), you can take your time eating the small plates or enjoying bigger plates. They have many different wines of which you will find something you like. I had The Red Sangria which I liked. Would have liked to see fruit in my Sangria, but considering the rest of the meal I was very satisfied.The Bar, seats around 15, with table seating as well. A total remodel from Rosies Bakery and Playska. Very nicely done. Warm and inviting with many very nice aromas. Bartender Rob is great, allowing you the time to savor your cuisine and explain what the cuisine is about.Went with a Friend and had 3 dips for $12 consisting of Muhammara (reddened red pepper walnut dip), Hummus with mint, and Labneh & Beet . Accompanied with bread and a special homemade bread for dipping, it all hit the spot. Much to eat with the dips.Then my friend had the Octopus with fennel yogurt ($14) which was as yum as the Kafta ($9) that I had.Definitely a Restaurant to frequent. Looking forward to going back.Visited October 2016",4,11/17/2016,Moona
363,"I found Moona on the list of new restaurants to open in fall in the Boston area and was looking forward to trying it. We stopped early without a reservation and were accomodated to get seated at the bar as the place was packed already! I can't stress enough how great this restaurant it and everything about it. The staff is incredibly friendly, we were offered to taste the wines before we selected them for dinner, we got great recommendations for them. And food was just magnificient, I can truly say it's one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. The menu is fairly small when it comes to entrees but each seem to be designed to perfection. We tried one appetizer and two entrees and each of them tasted just incredible. If you are a vegetarian, your selection might be somewhat limited, but plenty of choices for great meat dishes and some fish. They were open for less than a month when we dined there, I hope & wish for them to stay this fabulous forever. And yes, I'm planning to go back there again & again!",5,11/19/2016,Moona
364,The restaurant feels very comfortable and cozy. Prices are very reasonable for the quality. Easy to park close by. Great place to have dinner with friends. Food is delicious. Two thumbs up.,5,11/21/2016,Moona

367,"Came here on Wed the night before Thanksgiving and thought it was really good! We were able to get a reservation via open table and they even texted us before our reservation to make sure we were on time and you could text back if you were running late.+ nice variety of food, although way more meat than fish or vegetarian/vegan options.+good size for the portions -- the octopus was by far the best. +waitress was not all that knowledgeable or helpful about the menu; they were also sold out of the beer we wanted but gave us a generous tasting of an alternative+Cozy, nice vibe and generally good location with easy parking on Hampshire if you have Cambridge Permit or park at a meter.The biggest qualms were probably just the overall ambiance; tables don't have table cloths, the area is a little cramped/loud & very awkwardly when we were just relaxing after paying the bill we were told we had to leave because there was another reservation after us. As far as I know it is never good etiquette to tell someone to leave... even if they are paid...you would think as Morrocans they would appreciate a drawn out meal with family that lasts for hours.A-OK addition to the neighborhood; probably would be back only to sit at the bar and order the octopus from there :)",3,11/26/2016,Moona
368,"As disappointing as a place can get. Literally sitting here and writing this review. We were welcomed by a waiter who was trying to be oversmart and wanted us to sit at the bar despite having a reservation and despite them having a table for us. Next was really some low quality olive oil with rather stale bread being served. We ordered hummus and muhamarra both of which were, again, stale. Next we ordered hassleback sweet potatoes and they were served burnt with full knowledge of them being so. The moment we said they were burnt, they took it back fully acknowledging that they were not fit for consumption (but we were just trying to pass it off hoping you won't complain). Waiting for the couscous now. Let's see what we get. To be fair, the couscous was ok. I would rate it at being better than edible, but that's about it.",1,11/26/2016,Moona
369,"Don't know where to start, given that words or pictures won't do this place justice. My husband and I sat at the bar because the place was jammed and loved every minute of it. Rob, behind the bar, is so enthusiastic about the food and about the wine list that we'll likely sit there again; intentionally this time. We also got to talk to one of the co-owners who was extremely humble, considering the caliber of food (we're kinda foodies...) and said that he wanted to open a NY-style restaurant where the food quality was great, but the restaurant still lacks the pretentious air. Would definitely call this mission statement a success. We dropped 100$ and we're both poor students. Nearly cried with all the dishes we tried and can't wait to go back. FANTASTIC date night location. No regrets.",5,11/26/2016,Moona
370,"First and only time so far. Enjoyed it thoroughly. The Persian Cucumber snack, octopus mezze and lamb tagine main were all excellent. The latter two were among the best renditions of these respective dishes I've had anywhere. We tried a couple of other dishes but the ones above were the standouts (nothing was bad though). The ""pickled lemon"" ice cream was also interesting, and the baklava superb. The tiny space has also been used well and feels a lot nicer than in earlier incarnations.   I'll be back.",4,11/28/2016,Moona
371,"Enjoyed a truly excellent meal at Moona! Came with friends to celebrate our engagement. Was so happy to find a table available for an 8pm reservation although the space is small and there aren't a lot of tables. We absolutely loved the bread rolls with zaatar and homemade date molasses orange blossom butter. Incredible!!! The dips were good, I favored the labneh with beets which was deliciously pungent. The sangria was a bit tart so may stay away if you're in the mood for a sweet drink. Loved the brussel sprouts and couldn't taste the coriander (I hate cilantro!) The local greens fattoush was yummy but a bit small... they should cut the price to $5-6 or make it double this size! We enjoyed the couscous with gravy even though it could have used a bit of a savory contrast (maybe they could have added bits of lamb or short ribs to counterbalance the raisins and caramelized onions?) The lamb chops were okay but forgettable that's one dish I could make better at home. Ice cream dessert was also just okay. Despite the hit or miss items we still were positive overall and enjoyed the cozy vibe. So overall a really fun and memorable experience!!!! Can't wait to come back!!",5,12/1/2016,Moona
372,"Wildly disappointing. Went with my s/o for her birthday. While the table (three loud women on their phones taking photos of the food) were pampered, we were effectively lost in the woods, completely ignored. Some of the worst service I've had at a restaurant 'of this calibre.' The food was rushed, rushed, rushed. Sweet potato and Brussels sprouts had nice flavor (though like in a review someone else wrote below, the potato was burnt), but little else. Sauces were bland. Embarrassing portion for the scallops - three of those minuscule things you put into your Thanksgiving stuffing, with a smear of root vegetable puree. We had six dishes, wine, and dessert, and the bread & butter were the best thing I ate. Will go to Sarma next time.",1,12/1/2016,Moona
373,"Went with Mom and GF. This one will be short and sweet. We tried a bunch of stuff and overall thought most of it was OK. Nothing really blew our collective minds. The atmosphere is nice. Service was good if not a little too attentive but whatever, it aint no thang. One of the dips was like mashed potatoes and garlic? Delicious but sorta like mehh. Everything was FINE it just wasn't like WHOA I WANT TO EAT THIS.",3,12/3/2016,Moona
374,"For a restaurant whose concept is ""sharing plates,"" the actual ""sharable"" plates at Moona are anything but. The ""sharing plates"" concept conjures images of abundance and plenty, thus you share in the bounty and goodness. But the actual experience at Moona failed to deliver on its very concept. First, the plates themselves are minuscule. Then the food on that tiny plate is even more remarkable in its smallness. Instead of flowing abundance, we are reminded of sparseness, stinginess, lacking and greediness on the part of the proprietors. A teaspoon is too large a utensil to pick up the smidgen of dip on to your own plate. A butter knife may be a little bit more appropriate because there's nothing much to pick up. One or 2 tiny drops of the food and there is nothing more. It was not even enough food to determine whether the food was good or not.i can't even say the plates are enough for one person. Not even. All the dips - miserable portions, not even enough for one person. Fattoush salad is a small one-portion.One could of course order more but it would just conjure up more images of sparseness and stinginess. What's the point? We weren't even hungry, needing just a bite to eat before a show. But I was first turned off by the unappealing / unappetizing blob sitting on the bread plate when I first sat. It looked like grey poop that's been sitting out.Despite ordering dips, we were not served different bread in addition to the left-over bread sitting on the table from the beginning. But the rolls were too dense and uncooked inside, thus not edible anyway. So it was fine that no more bread was served. What was good - chicken bastilla and octopus. The labneh was good too. But you can't survive on just labneh if you are vegetarian.What was right portion but not so great in texture - the vine leaves were tough. The Whole Foods salad bar stuffed grape leaves are extremely delicious compared to this.What was great - the orange blossoms and rose water ice cream and chocolate molten cake.So instead of feeling rejoiced at having shared bountiful plates of fresh and delicious food, I was left with feeling deprived, having been served food from an apparently sparse pantry (Moona means pantry). Too bad b/c the parking was excellent.",1,12/4/2016,Moona
375,"What a great new addition to the neighborhood! The food is vaguely Middle Eastern, and everything is fantastic. We sat at the bar and asked the bartender for recommendations. He was spot on on every call. The lamb shank was to die for! We're definitely coming back here when we both want to be stuffed.",5,12/7/2016,Moona
376,"While the food was tasty and ambiance very nice, we felt rudely rushed. It was Sunday evening, we had a reservation that we were on time for, and we had ordered a ton of food. Pressure to turn the tables should never be noted by the guest, and they weren't good at hiding the fact that they wanted us to hurry up and leave. It first started with too many items being brought out at once. Our table was crowded and we couldn't get to everything while the food was still hot. I would have thought this was just an error in the timing between the server and kitchen, but then the host came by to tell us to hurry because the lamb was best when hot. Hmmm, maybe there's a reason we are struggling to do so?!Then, the server kept trying to take plates from our table before we had finished them (multiple times). There was clearly food still being eaten!Lastly, while we were still eating dessert, the server dropped the check off, took my coat-check ticket, and said ""I'll get your coat"". Not a subtle hint. The host handed me my coat before we had finished our icecream or signed the check.I understand the need to turn tables, but if you make your diners feel this invaluable, you won't have anyone sitting at your tables in the first place. With their price-point, and the nature of mezze dining, they can't expect diners to be in and out in an hour. The experience of dining in this style is as important as the food itself. I refrained from giving 3 stars, as frustrated as I am, because the food was delicious and I hate to see the kitchen staff be under-appreciated.",4,12/11/2016,Moona
377,"Solidly 4 stars, maybe 5. The space is extremely cute, and super cozy for a winter date night. The wine list is good, but no liquor. Not a big deal for me since wine seems a better fit with the food. The menu is creative and diverse - I wanted literally every item, but we settled on hummus, chicken bastilla, hasselback sweet potatoes and a lamb tagine. We would have ordered more but while waiting on our third, we ate 2 orders of bread. Which reminds me. We were nervous bc there was a big possibility our third would be late, and the reviews here all state how poor the customer service is with dining times. However, the staff that night were nothing but accommodating and welcoming, allowing us to take our time without rushing us. Probably because it was Tuesday but it's definitely worth mentioning. Definitely returning.",4,12/23/2016,Moona
378,"Great new place in Inman square, taking over the space formerly occupied by Rosie's and then Playska. They've opened up the space and it looks much nicer than before.Great tapas, we asked Rod, the owner, for his recommendations and they were spot on. The octopus is great as is the chicken liver and the Brussels sprouts. The chicken bastilla can be shipped though, it tastes good, but tends to fall apart when you try to eat it. We tried the Kunafeh for dessert but didn't like it. It felt like melted mozzarella string cheese, which isn't what you expect for dessert. The Kunefe at Sofra is an order of magnitude better. Still, it was a good experience overall, and we'll definitely go back.",4,12/25/2016,Moona
379,"I enjoyed my first dinner at Moona. It wasn't a gastronomic feast, but I enjoyed the creativity (and just the tastiness) in some of the dishes and look forward to returning to try the rest of the menu. Three stars, though, at least for now.I loved the cozy interior space and the color combination of the walls, furniture, and the tiles. We were greeted with a complementary bread plate with baguette and bread with zaatar - which was delicious. And so was the molasses butter that came on the side.A friend and I shared several small plates, most of which were to the point and a couple were frankly confusing. My favorites were the octopus and walnut crusted cod - which were cooked just the way I like them (the texture!). The brussels sprouts tasted a bit under-roasted (or cooked), but I give credit for the creative combination of tahini, berries, coriander, and pine nuts.The only disappointment came from the sweet potato hasselback. To be honest, I felt betrayed to eat this $7 sweet potato. The tahini was a tiny drizzle compared to the sweet potato, and I was confused as to the resulting lack of flavor (and substance aside from the sweet potato itself). I would've liked it if the tahini was more generously served - and if the outer texture (characteristic of hasselback) stood out a bit more.As for dessert, we tried the sahlab ice cream. It was perfect as a palate cleanser, and I enjoyed tasting the creative combination of rose and orange(?) with the milky ice cream. Very interesting.Overall, it was a pleasant, gastronomically fun meal. The hasselback really stood out as uninspiring and remains a mystery...",3,12/27/2016,Moona
380,"I came here with a friend who loves Mediterranean food, and we were pretty excited to try a new spot, particularly given the dearth of good Mediterranean food in the area.  We had made reservations for earlier in the evening, but despite it being relatively new, we didn't need to--by the time we were leaving though the place was starting to fill.The place itself is a good date spot--nice mood lighting, large front open window, semi-open kitchen.  We were promptly seated and offered menus and told about the concept of the restaurant.  They recommend 3-4 small, sharing plates and an entree for a party of two, but we deviated from this a little.  They have a relatively limited menu in terms of entrees, so we opted to share more of our plates.  The small plates/dips range from $4-14; the entrees range from $17-32.  We started with a little wine--I had the grenache-syrah-cinsault, which I was happy with.  We then proceeded to order the labneh and beet dip, the tzatziki, the brussel sprouts, sweet potato hasselback, walnut crusted cod, and a few others.  The food was actually better than expected.  Highlights were the labneh and beet dip, which actually tasted a little sweet (and I don't typically enjoy beets too much), and the brussel sprouts.  I'd probably eat brussel sprouts out of the trash I like them so much though, so maybe I'm not the best judge of what consitutes a good brussel sprout.  The food was a solid four stars I'd say.  What took the place down for me was a few issues.  First, we ordered two dips but were given two small pieces of bread each.  The dips arrived in moderately sided portions, and we had to ask for additional bread twice.  The other issue was that despite us continuing to order drinks and food, the waitress seemed particularly annoyed with us, as if we were keeping a table and preventing her from earning more that evening.  As I said, we continued to order, so I'm not too sure what her issue was exactly.  I'd happily come back here for the food--like I said, a solid four stars.  I hope that when I do return they've made a few improvements in terms of service though.",3,12/28/2016,Moona
381,"Was greeted at the door by a man to take my coat.  While waiting for our food, they gave us a baguette and flatbread with lebanese olive oil and some delicious butter.  The sage lamb shank I got was delicious (not to mention timely).  I highly recommend this place.  We did have to sit at the bar as the seating was full, but I don't feel like this took away from the experience. 10/10 would go again.",5,12/29/2016,Moona
382,"I've dined here twice now, and I'm a fan. The layout has been completely transformed from it's prior incarnation as Rosie's Bakery (and, subsequently, as Balkan bakery/sandwich-shop Playska), and it's an improvement! It's cozy, but the space stretches back around a long bar, and the even lighting and beautiful decor make for a more comfortable atmosphere.The bar focuses on wine and beer, with the menu listing just two cocktails, both aperitifs. The tapas were very good. The charred octopus with preserved lemon has to be far and away my favorite, after ordering that on my first visit, I had it again on the return. The sweet potato hasselback (a sweet potato fanned out almost into chips, drizzled with tahini and dusted with something to give it a bit of a crunch) was quite tasty. Good bread is served with good olive oil, and the menu lists additional dips (if it's one of the dishes, you don't have to worry about filling up on bread).Ice cream and Arabic coffee made an excellent dessert.",4,1/2/2017,Moona
383,"Quickie review.Appetizers plates  Octopus large tentacle, tender and savory, Short ribs refreshing take on what many other restaurants render boring, Duck confit, ample portion, tender and flavorfulEntrees.  Lamb shank tagine, big hunk of lamb leg in savory gravy. Beware this dish calls for a side order or couscous (not included).  Vegetable couscous, expertly prepared with plenty of veggies (e.g. rutabaga, the hip name for turnips)Some points to ponder.Reservations are merely taken as guidance by the staff. Prepare to wait 20 minutes or more even so.  Parties of three or more are not easily served by this small establishment (formerly Rosie's Bakery).  Party of two is an ideal size. Try to order by 8:00 or you run the risk of learning your selection is sold out (e.g. the lamb chops or molten chocolate cake).All in all one of the nicest additions to the Cambridge restaurant scene especially considering the paucity of good Moroccan and Lebanese establishments.",4,1/8/2017,Moona
384,"Moona was fantastic! The octopus and cauliflower were my favorite. The dips were yummy -- as were the specialty drinks. Just good all around. So excited about this restaurant. And, to top it all off, the service was excellent.",5,1/14/2017,Moona
385,Had the most disappointing dinner. We ordered their signature grilled fish. They brought us two tiny fish that were all bones. We told the waiter we were not happy. He came back and said the chef thought the fish was adequate. Not worth the time or money.,2,1/15/2017,Moona
386,"Heads up, if you don't have a reservation you will dine at the bar. Tables are exclusively for guests who've made reservations. Popped in to Moona, reservation-less, after a much needed soak at Inman Oasis. No longer seeing Rosie's still takes some getting used to and after driving by on several occasions I've been looking forward to the opportunity to check it out.  The setup is very clean and chic but be mindful of the bar stools. I tried to sit all 'prettily' and looked like I was about to audition for a Life Alert commercial ""Help I've fallen and I can't get up"". The staff is friendly and attentive and the menu is concise. I wasn't able to order an entree bcz almost everything had nuts and seeds (heads up to the nut allergy sufferers) and I can't have any at this time due to my braces. The Mezza selection was amazing! I had the beef short rib with parsnip puree OMG! So tender and flavorful! Please make this an entree! I could have eaten 3 of those (wishful thinking, I know) bcz it was perfection on a plate and the parsnip puree is a perfect compliment to the meat. DE-LISH! The Merguez (lamb sausage) is delightfully spicy and Taklia (potatoes) rounded it off nicely. There's also a bread plate with slices of baguette and other breads served with maple butter and olive oil. Just take my money! Like flavor? They've got it. Like a nice wine selection? They've got it. Like great service? Got it!Looking forward to going again!",4,1/19/2017,Moona
387,"A friend and I headed to Moona before a show and had a mixed experience. Would definitely give a 3.5, but am rounding up because overall it was an enjoyable experience. When we arrived we greeted (what seemed) a bit skeptically, probably because my friend and I are on the younger side; however, our waitress was wonderful. The restaurant is tiny with Northern African/Mediterranean inspired decor, a small open kitchen that you can look into and talk with the chefs, and a wall of wines behind the bar. Each table gets some oil and sea salt honey orang blossom butter to accompany baguette and za'atar spiced bread. We ordered the Octopus, Brussel Sprouts, and Grilled Whole Fish.Octopus - this was by far our least favourite dish, the presentation as a full tentacle was nice, but there is a difference between charred and burnt. It was definitely the later, but the inside was still tender, so it was okay once we got through the tough crust.Brussel sprouts - These were amazing, I have already started to scheme how I can replicate these at home. It's served is a cast iron tray with warm tahini, pine nuts, and barberries. It was like eating a warm hug, perfect for the cold weather. The caramelized sauce that gathers at the bottom is perfect for dipping the za'atar bread in.Grilled Whole Fish - This dish is definitely a show stopper and presented beautifully. It is served whole, so you do have to fillet it yourself, which isn't difficult because it is so tender. The fish varies on what's available so we were presented with bass (I know that they've also have had red snapper in the past.) A pile of homemade hummus is hidden underneath the fish which is swimming in sea of olive oil. The spicing and fresh herbs are delicious, as well as the two different lemons (on is preserved and the other is candied or caramelized I believe). While the oil heavy dish may put some people off, the olive is high quality and doesn't leave the dish feeling greasy. The presentation and taste reminded me of the fish dishes I'd had while living in Morocco.For two we ended up with half of the fish to take away, and my friend liked the butter so much that they gave us two small containers to go. However, they placed the fish in the take away container upside-down (smaller part of the container on the bottom) so the oil leaked out and onto the car seat and there were issues with printing the check so we had to wait a while for them to finish with other customers and then figure out why it had printed incorrectly.",4,1/26/2017,Moona
388,"Delish food, cozy atmosphere, and super knowledgeable and friendly staff. Grilled octopus was amazing. Waitress was very patient w our difficulty in choosing a wine and helped us out w some great recs. Been twice -- first time was better than second in terms of quality and quantity of food, but will definitely keep on my list of solid restaurants in Cambridge.",4,1/28/2017,Moona
389,"I heard from the owner, here is a bit of his response:""However, the big mistake we made was to worry so much about what's going to happen in the future instead of focusing on you at the moment.  I remember how we greeted you with concern that you might be a late arriving party and delay us.  I'm so sorry to make you feel that way.""This gets 5 stars because when was the last time someone took in your feedback and apologized?  At least, on here?",5,1/30/2017,Moona
390,"Really wanted to like this place since we live right in Inman. My roommate made a reservation on Sunday January 29 for 3 at 7:30 to celebrate my birthday. Walked in a few minutes early and the place was packed. Every table looked like they were just halfway with their meals. The hostess apologized and said it was going to be a 15 minutes wait. By the judge of the tables, that was doubtful but we decided to stay since 2 people left the bar. We thought we could at least get a drink while we waited, but no. The bartender just looked at us and immediately put down reserved signs. We would've fine with standing still but he didn't even smile or offered us a drink since it was clearly obvious that we were making moves to sit down. So we were cramped up in the tiny restaurant like chickens by the bar, with no acknowledgements from the bartender. 15 minutes passed and we had to track down the hostess for a status update. She informed us that it'll probably be another 15 minutes and pointed to the table that we were assigned. First off, this table is made for a 2 top! They wanted us to squeeze into the tiniest space between 2 parties. How did they expect a party of 3 to comfortably sit and enjoy their tapas in that space? Secondly, the hostess also said that the guests were still waiting for another dish! They still had half full wine glasses. What if that dish was delayed, they wanted another round or dessert? No way that it would've been just another 15 minutes. That's when we decided to bounce. Had we been acknowledged and gotten drinks at the bar, we would've stayed maybe the food could have redeemed Moona. I understand that this is a popular restaurant but and there could've been external factors that management could not have controlled but this seems like it's an ongoing issue based on the other reviews. Seems like they're trying to turn tables within 1.5 hours or so. They should've given us a table for 4, not tried to squeeze us in for a 2 top table. I'd rather be told there's no space then being denied a table when you have a reservation. An extra star is solely based on the hostess. You could tell she was apologetic and offered to get the manager for us but at that point, I didn't see a need for it. Shame they left a sour impression on 3 locals.",2,2/5/2017,Moona
391,"Moona is a great new restaurant in Inman Square serving a modern take on Middle Eastern / Mediterranean cuisine. And boy is it good. We went with visiting family looking for a bit of a special occasion, and this place did not disappoint. We asked our waiter for recommendations, and he steered me towards a lamb shank which was fall-off-the-bone-divine. You have to try it.Moona is a triple threat of new, delicious, and trendy, so reservations are a must for now. We went on a Wednesday night and every table was packed. It looks like they serve dinner at the bar, too, so those seats were not available for patrons just looking for a drink. We saw many a hungry inquirer's eyes go wide when the hostess informed them how long their wait for a table would be. So plan ahead. But it's so worth it. There are a few good places to eat in Inman, but this is truly unique and a special addition the neighborhood.",5,2/10/2017,Moona
392,"Definitely make reservations for this tasty and cozy tapas style Mediterranean restaurant.  The food was excellent and beautifully crafted but if I had to go to one Med-tapas place, I'd recommend Sarma over Moona.",4,2/11/2017,Moona
393,Moona has a fantastic ambiance combined with truly unique dishes. The menu is divided in small and large plates. I recommend going with a wider variety of smallerplates (2-3 per person).,5,2/18/2017,Moona
394,"Felt lucky to get a reservation today, for this evening. Unique cocktails. Chicken bastilla & brussel sprouts were both quite tasty. Fish tajine not up to the same level of deliciousness . Our server, Carlos, was quite pleasant. The chairs were uncomfortable & we felt very, very rushed; as if we were playing Beat the Clock!!!",3,2/19/2017,Moona
395,"Overall:Moona is an adorable place with great tasting food!! Physical Plant:It is a really small restaurant which is nice because it feels very intimate but some of the tables are very close together. A great place for sitting very close to the people you are with! I liked how our waiter explained that Moona means pantry in Arabic, and that we were meant to feel like the restaurant was (with their house pickles on display on shelving in the back corner of the restaurant) reminiscent of a pantry, which I did experience. Food: We had the chicken liver with sesame date jam and pickles, the dips, pickles, and olives plate, and the kunafeh. The chicken liver was rich and delicious, and paired very well with the jam. I enjoyed the dips and olives but they were not spectacular as far as my experience with other versions of those dips is concerned. The labneh stood out among the dips. I believe it is made in house and it is delicious and very flavorful. The date butter was also a favorite of mine. I could not stop eating it.Kunafeh is my favorite dessert and I was very excited to try Moona's version. One thing that I was missing from Moona's version of kunafeh was the deep golden brown color that I am used to for kunafeh. However, the taste of the kunafeh was really nice, and the orange blossom syrup that was served on the side really amped up the flavor and texture of the dessert.",4,2/24/2017,Moona
396,"So we showed up on a busy Friday night only to realize that we made our reservation for the week after, bummer...But wait! The manager/host graciously fit us in, and boy was it worth it.We ordered a bunch of plates for the table. Started with the hummus plate. I could not stop eating the bread - made my own version of bruschetta topped with hummus, some sort of dope cheese spread, olives, etc. This is a perfect starter to share.Next we had the braised beef short rib, an octopus dish, as well as a duck dish. ALL WERE GREAT. The short rib was so tender, the octopus was delicious, and the duck was so fatty and scrumptious. I tried some vermouth cocktail - next time I'll stick to red wine or beer (they don't sell hard liquor). Overall, unique and tasty food - can't wait to go again and try out different dishes (like that lamb shank ahhh!).",5,3/1/2017,Moona
397,"Oleana has nothing to worry about. This restaurant is completely bogus. Of the 4 dishes we ordered, 3 were full-on nasty and 1 was mediocre: The octopus was tough and just this side of spoilage. It had an unpleasantly strong fishiness that has never plagued any octopus I've eaten. The under-seasoned beef short ribs weren't cooked long enough to become tender or to render most of the fat, so they remained full of rubbery gristle. The parsnip puree on which they sat was cold the first time and cold again after having been sent back and re-presented. The chicken bastilla was less than the sum of its supposed 15 parts: The filling was only distinguished by an excessively sweet blandness. The mussels were reasonably plump and fresh-tasting, and the dish arrived hot, but the bitter sauce didn't inspire dipping--nor did the scorched toasts.",1,3/6/2017,Moona
398,"Octopus was overcooked, mussels were in a very salty and the beef short rib was lacking salt. I really wanted to like this place as I love small, unpretentious and more cozy places. But the food was not up to par.",3,3/7/2017,Moona
399,"Walked in one evening and got seating after a short wait. Liked how they took our coats and gave them back. Great, friendly, knowledgeable waitstaff and owner/manager. Saw people come in who had reservations but had to wait longer - but everyone was good tempered about it. Really really really liked the food. The flatbread with dips was particularly amazing - all the breads were great, actually. (Don't remember more details because this was some time ago. I thought I'd posted this but just found it didn't get shared and I lost the draft. Oh will. Will just have to go there again).",5,3/13/2017,Moona
400,"Enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and service. We had the dip which is very good specially with the amazing bread..., the artichoke which was great. The best was the Brussels sprout really really good and original. The veggie couscous was just ok for me but my wife liked it. Wine was super good and desert as well. We will go back for the spring menu for sure!",5,3/18/2017,Moona
401,"Small portions, average food, high prices. The kafta (ground lamb) was 9 bucks for one meatball. The place is small and aims for trendy rather than charm. This all being said the service was great and the waiters were very attentive. If you're looking for mediterranean food in the area Oleana offers bigger portions with a warm environment.",2,3/18/2017,Moona
402,"Loved everything about our evening with Moona! Despite having two seats at the bar, the service was incredibly attentive and friendly. Even thought it was a busy Saturday night.The bread plate is incredible, so build that into your ordering. It's free and they are generous with refills. We ordered 3 mezes and a main dish and it ended up being a bit too much food, but we at it anyway. Definitely recommend the chicken rolls.",5,3/19/2017,Moona
403,"Had another exquisite dinner at Moona! The service is attentive, informative, friendly, and prompt.  The food is incredible.  Each plate had something delicious and unique to offer.  You could tell that everything was fresh and that there was a lot of thought and detail put into the making of each dish.

405,"Great food and wonderful service says it all. When you read the descriptions, you think maybe the dishes are a little too complicated and fussy. They are not - the flavors are always interesting and surprising. Two of us shared five small plates and were full. The hosts were gracious and thanked us by name as we left. We had two servers - both excellent, not a real server and trainee - which meant everything was so smooth and professional.I think the couple at the table next to us broke up by the end of the their meal, but we considered that free entertainment!",5,4/17/2017,Moona

Lots of mezza (small plates) to choose from and four big mains, and a gorgeous dessert menu including house made Saffron Rose ice cream and Moroccan cookies assortment. And loads of good wine and a very knowledgeable staff. I had a rose that was crisp with notes of strawberries and citrus, the warm aromatic mushroom mezza with pine nuts, and the grilled octopus which was the most tender I have ever had. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.",5,5/20/2017,Moona

The decors and ambiance is so lovely-- great for a date night or a night out with friends. Intimidate, trendy, fun, warm. But what will really keep us coming back is the staff-- so friendly, helpful and welcoming. Our second visit back the owner, Muhammad, and the bartender, Rob, both remembered us and greeted us warmly. Rob makes great suggestions for food and drink and makes sure everyone sitting at the bar had a great time and feels well taken care of. I can't say enough good things about Mohammad and his hospitality. Upon seeing my husband's disappointment that they were sold out of kanafeh... the owner himself, Mohammed proceeded to the back and started preparing us this deliciousness from scratch, himself. Love this place and will DEFINITELY be back and bringing friends to enjoy as well.",5,5/20/2017,Moona

410,"We came here as a party of 4 last night for a special dinner, and had a nice time. We were surprised at how small this place is, and how limited seating is, so I would definitely make a reservation! I loved the vibe of the intimate and unique atmosphere. One of the people in our party thought that the whole experience was a little bit pretentious - the elaborate descriptions of each ingredient as the dishes were brought out, the history of the restaurant, etc, but I kind of liked it.As a group of 4, we had the complimentary bread dish, 5 mezzas, and 2 main dishes, and it ended up being too much food! I would definitely recommend the dips and pickles mezza, mushroom mezza, and couscous main. The one that was probably our least favorite was the spring salad mezza. I also had a really delicious glass of white sangria. We wished we could've experienced some dessert, but we were surprised at how full we got on the small plates!",4,5/30/2017,Moona

Secondly five stars does not do any justice to the meal and service we just experienced here at Moona.We ordered just about everything on the small tapas menu, several things we ordered twice Stuffed Squid, Octopus and mussels. Everything was exceptional! Superb flavors in every dish along with phenomenal presentation. You don't need a reservation to sit at the bar and there was seating available when we walked in. The bartender Rob was fantastic along with the owner Mohamed who greeted us and Chef Mark, wow!! Bravo on the deliciousness you kept serving us. We will be back soon! Thank you!",5,6/5/2017,Moona

414,"Small cozy place in Inman square Cambridge, it was very quiet here when we decided to visit this lovely restaurant which was the old Rosies bakery.. Moona serves up some very interesting, unique Mediterranean cuisine, the spices were extraordinary and each dish was mouthwatering!! Lamb kafta: this was something I never heard of cause it's usually made with beef. I was thinking this chef better amaze me and put a smile on my face cause if he messed this up it's over and I will simply bash them on this review. One bite and I thought I was dreaming smack me twice to make sure I am awake cause the unthinkable just happened. Cooked perfectly and the spice combination  was just right.the love that was put into this dish was spectacular!!Moona and now you want me to try a  popular Palestinian dish who are you guys?? Maskahan:  Palestinian  dish, composed of roasted chicken baked with onions, sumac, allspice, saffron, fried pine nuts and covered with bread but at moona they took it to another level and made them into a  spring roll that was stuffed with chicken and served with a yummy pomegranate yogurt. I was moved and felt all this was new to me.. What I came for was their dessert  the kunafa as it shows on their website it was available and saw a picture of it. I was eager to try it after dinner but it's no longer on the menu that was a dissapointmet!! Overall service was great and the restaurant was extremely cozy and loved the open kitchen",4,6/13/2017,Moona
415,"If a bunch of random online sources are to be believed, Moona means wish in Arabic.   Assuming that's accurate, then I moona this place offered a menu with prices to match the portions they're serving.And fwiw, I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm not about supersized food. In fact, I don't do well at all-you-can eat buffets whatsoever.  I don't have the stomach for 'em. Ba-dum BUM!  But seriously, this being said, I also want to feel like what I'm paying for a dish makes sense, factoring in, of course, variables like quality of ingredients, cooking technique, ambiance, and service.  Overall, it didn't feel that way here:Our meal started off nicely enough with a delicious complimentary bread plate. What I don't get, though, is why the Sampler Trio of Dips & Pickles that we ordered did not come with any bread, or pita chips...or crudites... or something. Who eats dip, in this case Hummus, Tztatsiki, and Muhammara, without anything to duh, dip in it?  Why did we have to flag down our server to request bread?  And for $16, there were just 3-4 thimblefuls of each dip. Since so many Yelpers raved about the Octopus, we ordered that too. It was, indeed, tasty, but portion-wise, it literally consisted of one tentacle for a total of about 6 bites.  My math sucks, but at $16, that's more than $2 per each tiny bite.   The $28 Daily Lamb was another, frankly insultingly overpriced dish. This consisted of maybe 5 or 6 tiny medallions of lamb, kale, and some sort of pickles. The lamb was unevenly cooked, with some of it a nice, rosy pink medium and other pieces cooked beyond that.  And to add insult to injury, one of these tiny pieces of lamb was mostly bone.  In hindsight, we should have ordered 2 or 3 more *small* (hah!) plates instead.We also got the Ramp & Currant Fritters, Chicken Bastilla, and Msakhan Rolls (almost like a Middle Eastern-inspired taquito or egg roll).  I remember wishing the Bastilla had been dusted with the traditional powdered sugar, rather than drizzled with honey, but other than that, all three of these were enjoyable and within the realm of what I expected in terms of portion for the price.Service was pleasant and attentive.  Small dining space felt festive, if a bit too reminiscent of NYC, with its claustrophobia inducing, it's-a-challenge-to-navigate-if-you-have-to-get-up-and use-the-restroom table arrangement.TL;DR: Food here was solid overall, though nothing stood out as something I'd ever want to eat again.  And unless you've got disposable income to burn, you're likely to be peeved by some of the laughably (cryably?) small portions. It's a shame because the food was definitely better than 2 stars, but I gotta agree with fellow Yelper, Aly .. in that the whole experience  conjured up ""images of sparseness and stinginess.""ps... Per the restaurant's website, Moona also means pantry in Arabic.  Not a very abundant pantry, apparently.",2,6/23/2017,Moona
416,"Cambridge just added another fantastic Mediterranean restaurant with ingredients from the Levant, Morocco, and Yemen.   You are welcomed with a bread basket that includes a Zaatar bread and honey butter (Delicious!).  We had the octopus, squid, and fatoush salad for appetizers.  The flavors for all three were on point, though the octopus was a tad bit overcooked.  I will not nitpick on the dishes.  The restaurant is still new and I am confident the kinks will be sorted out (the partners are foodies and clearly thoughtful about the ingredients and the concept).  We ordered all four main dishes to share and they did a great job pacing and firing the dishes.  One dish stands out and I'd give it six stars if I could: the perfectly cooked flaky sea bass, crispy skin, with a mouth-watering fresh Zhough, and a bright lemony fava bean succotash (thanks chef for explaining the secret ingredient), a deep fennel fumet, with fresh parsley radish salad on top.  This had to be our favorite dish.   We had a great Lebanese wine from the Bqa' valley.  The chef was super nice and hospitality fantastic.This is a solid 4 stars for now with potential to be a 5 star.  I bumped it up to 5 stars for their service, the inspired sea bass dish, and overall concept.  This place has a terrific vibe and wonderful service.  We didn't feel rushed, and I walked out with a couple of ideas to incorporate in my own cooking!  Will definitely come back again and again.",5,6/29/2017,Moona
417,"When my Moroccan roommate recommended Moona to me, she cautioned that the food was ""weird Moroccan."" When I brought another Moroccan friend in to eat, we found out that it was a fusion of Moroccan, Lebanese, and other Mediterranean cuisines. We were greeted and seated by a friendly hostess, who offered to take my jacket and explained the menu. We ordered the Dips, Pickles & More; lamb kafta; and lamb tajine. The presentation was wonderful, and each dish had a unique flavor. Our (very polite) waiter explained each dish as it came to the table. Although the portions were rather small for the first two, the lamb tajine was huge and came with couscous. My Moroccan friend loved that it was served in the tajine, too! What really stood out to me at Moona was the service. When I went to the restroom, I came back to find that my napkin had been neatly folded. Our waiter also brought out a scoop of halawa ice cream for us to share at the end of the meal, on the house! Just a tip: don't even try coming here on the weekend without a reservation. If they're not booked through, the wait is still like 1.5 hours, since it's such a small space.",5,7/11/2017,Moona
418,"Vow. Just introduced by my son to yelp. And my first review on Yelp of this lovely (still somewhat) new restaurant. Lovely ambience, great service. The lamb Kafta the Merguez the octopus the sea bass each was delicious. The chicken tajine and the chicken rolls not as good mainly in comparison to the other absolutely delectable dishes. The Lebanese wine and the rose and orange blossom ice cream with the Turkish coffee was great. I would skip the frozen nougat dessert. All in all a lovely time and a memorable meal the three of us enjoyed ourselves immensely.",5,7/29/2017,Moona
419,"I actually went into Moona with two girlfriends and we said ""one of everything"" :) Best. Decision. Ever. We shared a few bottles of the Picpoul wine and had a GREAT time. My favorite thing on the menu was probably the muhammara in the dips, pickles, and more. The green garlic and currant fritters and lamb kafta were so flavorful and delicious. I actually got an order of both to go. Will be back for sure.",4,8/4/2017,Moona
420,"Green Garlic & Currant Fritters - 5/5. One of the best dishes I've ever had. I could go to the nicest tasting menu and be totally satisfied with this dish. Rich, crispy, heaven.(free) Bread and Flavored Crackers with Olive Oil and Date Butter - 5/5. The date butter is sweet but wonderfully delicious.Couscous Tfaya - 3/5. Solid couscous and brown sauce is quite good but the vegetables don't add a ton of flavor.Chicken Bastilla - 3/5 Disappointing. Moroccan Hospitality's version of this dish is far superior but even without that on my mind, it was more ordinary dish. Beautiful but the filling in the philo didn't have the strength of flavors I was hoping for. Msakhan rolls - 2/5. I needed someone to finish mine. The yogurt was well flavored but the rolls had very little flavor and didn't taste like much.White Sangria - 4/5. Fun mix of flavors, bright and crispRed Sangria - 3/5 RespectableOverall, very fun ambiance and the highs were incredible. I'd be happy to go back but would be very careful which dishes I choose.",4,8/5/2017,Moona
421,"I wanted to like this place - I really did. And the service is awesome. But the lack of flavor and subpar food was pretty disappointing. We ordered the sea bass (decent), kafta (dry), grilled octopus (overlooked and not in harmony with the yogurt sauce it sat in) and some cucumber tomato in yogurt sauce that just fell flat.",2,8/7/2017,Moona
422,"What a wonderful dining experience at Moona last night, where as new comers greeted like old friends long missed. We were provided the most delightful of eating experiences filled with eclectic Mediterranean flavors in each  small plate presentation. Each unique dish captured the romantic flare of this delightful Cambridge restaurant. I cannot wait to return.",5,8/20/2017,Moona
423,"When I saw a new restaurant coming to Inman Square last year, I was skeptical at first. But Moona is a true gem. I'm almost afraid to post this because everyone will find out about this place and my partner and I will never be able to grab a bar seat (our seat of choice). Every single dish I've had here has been thoughtfully crafted, flavorful, and delicious. I can't say I have anything constructive to say, other than to keep doing what you're doing. The bartenders are kind and generous, and the breads that they give when you sit down are the absolute best (the butter is so, so tasty). My partner and I always come here to celebrate any type of occasion! PS. Wakim, who has been our bartender a handful of times, is wonderful.",5,8/23/2017,Moona
424,"had dinner at moona  ( two of us) several times. This last time the food and the time it took to get the food on the table was very bad.Service ( waiters/waitress ) excellent.  Matt I had never met and was very good on the telephone. Brittany had been our waitress several times and she is just very, very good and friendly, without pretense.Reason why we have dined is because it is small and because we live very near.I ordered the leg of lamb, which was served ( after a long wait ) downright cold. Given that it was around 6:00 pm and the place was less than half full with several people in the kitchen, not something that should happen. Anyways, I asked Brittany to have it quickly warmed up as it was quite cold. It took forever to have it back on the table, and it was not for lack of service by the waitress. I asked a number of times what was going on. Finally by the time  it arrived I had eaten other smaller dishes that  we had ordered and after a bite or two asked to pack it and take it home.I eat lamb frequently as I really like it. I am quite tolerant although I know when it is good or just mediocre. This was overdosed with dry, uninspiring spices, not good by any means .I asked what happened to Mark ( the chef) who I had gotten to know and who speaks quite decent italian.  He was a good cook and got the dishes out cooked right.She told me Mark had left for another restaurant. Maybe I will find out where. I wanted to know who was  the main cook in the kitchen. Was told it was one of the two owners.Amazing ! the kitchen is open to view and the place is so small. An owner should have come over and apologized and tried to make up to the customer.  The kitchen was not busy. It would have taken a minute.The waitress must have mentioned that we were frequent customers. She told us that the owner told her to offer us ONE  free dessert for the screw ups. The generosity is touching ! The leg of lamb ( 3 or 4  thin slices was priced at $29, normal for lamb chops but not for leg of lamb). I told brittany that she should have the dessert at the end of the evening and that I just wanted to get out of there.The bill was quite high. Similar  or more than  what I would pay at Sarma or Oleana ( close by ) and about half of what you would spend at Highland Kitchen, less pretentious and far superior cooking talent.Makes me wonder how many of these reviews are for real and how many are ""buddies"".I should have sent the dish back but took it home. Tried to eat it later. It was tough and over spiced with boring dry spices. No , I do like moroccan / turkish food ( also eat at Hellman in cambridge.......their lamb chops are quite good).The only reason they may survive for a while is because people living in that area can well afford it and a population that walks rather than drive.Unfortunately Bergamot is also sub par and expensive with no reason. Very forgiving part of town.Gone Mark the cook.........................end of story for us. Moona, Bye bye !",1,9/2/2017,Moona
425,"Amazing food that has unique flavors. Heavily Lebanese and Moroccan influenced, the tapas styled Middle Eastern cuisine met my expectations for a special kind of meal when I came here from Los Angeles, looking for something to satisfy experienced palette. :P I mean, Los Angeles is a major city with tons of options--what can I Say?! The service was impeccable and the staff / owner made me feel a sense of intimacy. Great ambiance to boot. I am surely recommending this restaurant to anyone in the area and to any who will be visiting.",5,9/6/2017,Moona
426,"Very creative Mediterranean cuisine.  Absolutely delicious !!! Must try the Octopus, Brussels sprouts and kanafa.  The service was impeccable Britany our waiters was super attentive, the owner Mo, came and said hello And checked on all his guests. Highly recommend it.",5,9/9/2017,Moona
427,"Food was delicious. Especially enjoyed the zatar bread, Roasted Corn and the Chicken Bastilla. We had been very excited for the lamb which was on the menu online and were disappointed when we found out that menu was old and the lamb was not available. The staff went the extra mile though and pulled together an alternative lamb dish with what the had in the kitchen. Thanks for a great meal!",4,9/10/2017,Moona
428,"Wow. What an amazing find and all because there was a 1/2hour wait at my favorite INdian restaurant next door. EVERYTHiNG we had was full of flavor...Moroccan/Middle Eastern flavor. From the date/molasses butter on the bread tray to our dessert of a spiced blueberry tart with an ice cream flavor I had never even heard of before (rosehips and blood oranges and who knows what else), it was all delicious. We combines small plates with a vegetarian couscous entree which was the best I have had in Boston, with mushroom triangles (boureka-like but with more flavor) and shish kabob. The flavors in this plate and the tenderness of the beef had as much in common with a skewered griiled meat as I do with Justin Bieber. Forget the skewers. Bring me seconds. And more of the bread, please, so I can sop up the yogurt sauce. A really great meal if you value flavor over fancy. Friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. I only wish I had ordered seconds on that shish kabob.",5,9/12/2017,Moona
429,"Amazing and flavorful food. I sat at the bar when I visited and I regret that I forget the bartender's name, but he was very kind, helpful, and friendly. The owner was incredibly attentive, even to me as a party of one without a reservation. It is very clear that he takes great pride in faithfully executing his family recipes and in satisfying his customers. This was one of the best meals and one of my best restaurant experiences during my time in Boston.",5,9/19/2017,Moona
430,"Awesome, creative, DELICIOUS, cozy, friendly, fun, lively. We cleaned every plate. The whole grilled fish was one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had anywhere.

431,"I have mixed feelings about this place. It has great reviews and it's in Cambridge so thought it had to be good. It's a very small place, handful of tables and a bar that maybe seats 10 people. Sat at the bar with a friend of mine. I had read about the three mezze platter so we ordered it just as we sat down with the ultimate plan to order plenty of other things but the waiter took our menus away- totally odd! When we finally got our menus back we ordered the crispy kale salad, a chicken filo dish and the feta fritters.  The feta fritters were good but the crispy kale salad had a bit of an odd flavor and the chicken filo dish was not my favorite. Maybe we ordered wrong but I wasn't all that impressed. The mezze platter was good but it's hard to mess that up and I felt like we kept having to ask for extra bread.",3,9/30/2017,Moona

434,"I got E. coli from eating Moona's food and was hospitalized for a week. I don't want to go into detail about how excruciating the whole ordeal was. I'll just say it was the worst pain of my life, and leave it at that.I know for sure that it was Moona's food that made me sick. They catered an event, and several of the other attendees also got food poisoning, including one who was also hospitalized, who I'd never shared a meal with outside of that event. I've been in touch with the Department of Health, which is investigating the outbreak.",1,10/14/2017,Moona
435,"Happened upon this place on a Saturday for an early dinner--and lucky for us they had a few spots not reserved at the bar! Service was very attentive and accommodating of dietary restrictions. Bartender is from Morocco, and very knowledgeable about the foods they serve. We shared three small plates and two entrees between four of us, and it was plenty. Food has obviously been prepared for much of the day, as it is tender and flavorful! Mix of Moroccan and Lebanese cuisine with a modern twist--presentation of all dishes was beautiful, and the staff explained each item when they brought the plate. Loved the decor inside, and all around had a very positive experience! Would definitely say call and make a reservation, though, if possible!",5,10/15/2017,Moona
436,"I wanted to like it.  But!  This is yet another ""tapas"" style place; except here the portions just could not be any smaller.  Really, those grape leaves, width of my pinky, and unfortunately nothing special.  Lamb kafta -- one very lonely small oval patty (for $12).  But most disappointingly, while the wait staff were nice, the owner who tends the bar is lacking that warm middle eastern hospitality and somehow manages to instead convey cold puritanical snobbery.",3,10/20/2017,Moona

We started with the squash fritters, eaten all by one person but was ordered to share. Chicken Bastilla, a little under cooked pastry, Shitake mushrooms also delicious. But the crowning dish was the whole fish! Spicy, smoky and really good. We will be back for that fish and their lovely Oregon Pinot.",4,10/30/2017,Moona
439,"The food is fine--as in nothing wrong with it, but nothing to write home about and certainly no reason to come back. At the price point, portion sizes are ridiculously small. Nothing exemplifies this better than the $12 lamb kafta: One sad and lonely little meatball, under-seasoned and overcooked. Compare that to Sarma's $12 lamb köfte sliders; that's right, sliders. Three of them. Perfectly cooked and expertly seasoned. No reason to waste your money here when Oleana is just down the street and Sarma not too far away.",2,10/30/2017,Moona
440,"The food was extremely sweet and this includes everything: appetizers and entrees. I have had mediterranean food several times before but it's never so sweet. I mean the beef tagine was sooo sweet and the chef also doesn't have any idea about the amount of salt you are supposed to add in your dishes. This place will seem awesome to people who haven't done much fine dining but if you really understand food, this place sucks! Try Sofra, Sarma and Oleana if you live in the Boston area.",2,11/10/2017,Moona

443,"Moona is serving up flavorful Middle Eastern small plates in Inman Square. I came here for mezze with one other person. We got 3 dishes, which was the perfect amount of food--I almost wish we ordered a little less so I would've had room for dessert!The Brussels sprouts with tahini, pine nuts, bayberries, and coriander ($9) were amazing--Moona proves that you don't need bacon to make Brussels sprouts taste fantastic! The squash fritters ($10) with maple syrup, sage, and feta were a tasty seasonal dish, with a strong sour kick from the sumac. The selection of dips and pickled vegetables ($16) came with crispy pita chips. Not sure if I would order this again, but the rich, creamy labneh was great. I also couldn't get enough of the sweet flavored butter (rosewater? honey? fig? date?) that came with the bread selection.For now they just have a beer and wine license, but liquor will be available in January. The beer and wine list is small but cool, with some interesting beers imported from Germany, Lebanon, and Palestine. I had a delicious Beirut pilsner ($6).The service here is friendly without being overbearing. I made a reservation through their website. It turned out not to be entirely necessary on a weeknight, but the process was so easy (loved the reminder texts) that I would recommend making a reservation anyway. It's a small space and they can get busy!Moona isn't exactly a fresh concept for the area (see: Sarma, Oleana), but I would definitely come back for the great service and interesting flavors. I also want to try out the brunch and dessert!",5,12/21/2017,Moona
444,"Incredibly interesting and delicious food, with excellent service! We opted to order a bunch of small plates to share, and among the 5 of us, 9 were sufficient to fill us up. My favorites were the spiced duck, squash fritters, octopus, and the pickles and dips plate. We also ordered the beef kebab, grape leaves, chicken bastilla (more sweet than savory), brussel sprouts, and fattoush. The service was prompt and warm; they offered to take our coats to the coat check, seated us quickly (even though we were early for our reservation), and gave us two delicious bread plates on the house. The wait staff knew a lot about the food they were serving and made recommendations. The atmosphere is cosy and the decor is tasteful, I would come back here again!",5,12/28/2017,Moona
445,"Celebrated the holidays after New Year with my team of 7 colleagues at Moona. Made a reservation, and were seated immediately, even though a few of us got stuck in a late meeting. Joachim ( apologies if I butchered your name) and team took great care of us, and we put him in charge of ordering a selection of Mezze and Main courses for the table. Best decision ever! Along with pitchers of lovely, fruity red sangria, we enjoyed several courses of bread, dips, and other delights. Of special note was the date butter (amazing start!), the pickled cucumbers and carrots served with the hummus and dips, the duck leg with the carrots, the octopus, the branzino and the short rib. Great service, beautiful and tasty food and a delightful park view-we couldn't have had a better evening! Highly recommend!",5,1/11/2018,Moona

447,"After hearing raves about Moona's food from fellow Elites, I was excited to hear that they started serving Sunday Brunch. The website says they don't accept brunch reservations, so we arrived at 11am in the hopes of beating the brunchy rush. We succeeded and were seated at a 2-seater right away. The cute space is a bit tight, we could hear the conversations of the tables next to us, so maybe don't choose this venue for a super private talk. Like a play-by-play of your crazy night. Or a breakup.We started with a round of Arabic coffees which were tiny and strong and slightly sweet. Just what you need on a sluggish Sunday morning to really get you going. There are many interesting-sounding options on the brunch menu. When we asked for recommendations, the friendly waitress said she loves the Ful Mdamas, which is a traditional dish with fava beans, parsley, tomato, and tahini with pita to dip. She also mentioned that the Shiitake Mushroom Fatteh was a very nice starter. However, we ignored all of that and went for the Shakshuka Tagine which are eggs poached in a spiced tomato sauce.The shakshuka comes out in a tagine, and the lid is lifted off in front of you at the table, revealing a bubbling potion of tomatoes, eggs, and spices. This is served with pita for your dipping delight. We enjoyed this comforting dish, especially considering the frigid temps. However, it wasn't the best shakshuka I've ever had. Even in Boston. It wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't very unique. Although I really only have myself to blame for not ordering the more unique-sounding items on the menu.No shakshuka regrets, but I would be interested to return, especially for dinner, and see the adorable, turquoise blue space in a different light.",4,1/31/2018,Moona
448,A great experience and awesome food! Very good and friendly service! I would totally recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience tastier and more sophisticated food than anywhere in the Boston area.,5,2/8/2018,Moona
449,"Moona is a cute & cozy mid-upscale Moroccan joint that is optimal for a casual night out or comforting dinner to catch up with some friends (which is why I was there). We were a group of four that made reservations for dinner on a Fri night, so we didn't have to deal with a wait. Given the smaller size of this place, I highly recommend you make one as well.We started with an assortment of dips, which was a lot smaller than I expected given the price tag, but it was delicious nonetheless. I had the chickpea couscous, which had a generous amount of cooked butternut squash and couscous (of course). I've had a fair share of couscous while traveling throughout Morocco, and my meal was filling and even comforting (I absolutely love butternut squash), but I wouldn't call it flavorful or impeccably delicious. Even though the couscous came with a side of vegetable broth, the meal was just not as flavorful as it could've been. It was missing something--more spices? More aromatic broth?Maybe I need to come back here a few more times to figure it out.",3,3/9/2018,Moona
450,"Fantastic Saturday night experience.  We had no idea how outrageously small it is, and strolled in with no reservations in prime time.  After an initial rebuff, we pleaded, and sure enough, they asked a couple to scooch down at the bar to make room for three at dinner.  All small plates--delicious.  Octopus was the favorite, Brussel sprouts were amazing, perfect char on the edges, and the lamb was off the charts.  When you get the bread, try the date butter--worth the trip in itself.  The two young ladies tending bar and serving us were SO friendly and sweet and knowledgeable.  The owner checked with us a couple of times which was classy.  Classic 5 star, but make a reservation!",5,3/10/2018,Moona
451,"Everything on the menu was executed flawlessly and Shaina made us feel right at home. The date, molasses butter is to die for and the Cabernet-Syrah from Lebanon is the right accompaniment to everything on the menu. Big props to the owner's sister for accommodating us without a reservation. We ended up trying about half of the Mezza menu and the lamb pork chops with pesto. Truly incredible! - Tómas, Moonate, Ginné & Gneil",5,3/13/2018,Moona
452,"Went to Moona to try out their new Bar Bites menu (only available Monday nights) and . Total, the bar bites menu came to $10 for five really exceptional plates. A great deal for a student like me. My favorite was the feta and honey fritters but they were all really good and each offered a distinct taste to the menu, and complemented each other really well. Ended up getting Kunafeh for dessert, which was super delicious and rich (perfect for splitting with a date). And the folks there are super nice (and so is the decor, which is really aesthetically pleasing). The presentation of the dishes make for nice posts for the gram too. Easily five stars for price/value, service, and ambiance.",5,3/26/2018,Moona
453,"Went to Moona for the first time.  We decided to come despite just being rear ended by another car and missing our reservation.  The remarkable staff were unbelievably kind and understanding on hearing of our misadventure .  They went out of their way to make sure we were OK(especially after we showed them pictures of the accident).  They gave us a complimentary appetizer (chick peas, mushrooms,nuts, yogurt,etc) that was unbelievably delicious.  We ordered a spicy red wine from the Bekka Valley in Lebanon and a dips, olives,pickled carrot mezze and the mussels and grilled bread mezze, both terrific items. The highlight of the meal was grilled Bronzino for two, redolent of Moroccan spices and lemon.  The grilled lemon that came with it made this mild white fish truly sumptuous.  We were given a complimentary ice cream sampler - the apricot sorbet and the preserved lemon ice cream were stand outs.It's amazing how simple kindness and interest in another person can make a great meal spectacular one. Moona has made me a loyal customer, who will return as often as I can.",5,4/3/2018,Moona
454,"Last night was my first visit after a good recommendation from a friend.  Started with a specialty cocktail and shared a good bottle of red wine.  Two of us shared three small plates and two terrines; all were over the top delicious, house bread plate to start was an unexpected treat with no room left for desert.  It's a small tight space, with great service, bar seats looked inviting.  Make a reservation and enjoy a nice evening.  I would go back in a moments notice.",5,4/13/2018,Moona
455,After a lovely soak in a private hot tub at neighboring Inman Oasis.My girlfriend and I walked down the Inmans' walkway and literally right next door is Moona. Now she'd been with friends but it was my first time and I was quite impressed. Make a reservation because seating is limited. the food is Mediterranean and it's delicious. They make sure to pack in all the flavors that the dishes require. No skimpin over here. They have a selection of Wines and beers from the places like Lebanon and Morocco. The owners are lovely. One of them Ron was his name I think came and ate his dinner right next to us and we chatted and he grabbed us a shot. It's pricey so bring some Paper and leave full and hapopy. We did!,5,5/4/2018,Moona
456,"Unfortunately, we had another bittersweet dining experience at Moona. First and foremost, the food was outstanding (per usual) and the hostess and wait staff were all very accommodating, fun, and generous, but there seems to be an issue with how reservations are handled. We had a 6:30 reservation for two on a Wednesday night and upon arrival we were informed that there were no tables available*, but we could sit at the bar. Not an absurd offer by any means, but my wife is/was 9 months pregnant and bellying up to a bar for a full dinner service just isn't an option. We were told that a table may be ready in about 20 minutes** if we wanted to wait. We decided to wait, and 20 minutes turned into just shy of an hour. While waiting, we witnessed other parties with reservations encounter the same seating dilemma. The hostess was very kind and offered us drinks, food, bread, anything, but we really wanted to enjoy our meal in its entirety at our table rather than while sitting/standing by the door. The manager at the time was aware of our situation, but cowered away from acknowledging us (probably because he remembered that this happened last time we dined here) and made a stealthy escape out the side door. The meal was delicious and highlights include the duck (gratis), brussels sprouts, and chicken entrée (specifically the spice rub). We will absolutely return, but are hoping that this issues gets resolved. One idea would be to call the guests ahead of time to see if bar seating would be an options.* We encountered this same problem last time we had a reservation, but there was only 1 bar seat available at the time, so sitting there wasn't an option.** I understand that the hostess isn't clairvoyant, so these predictions are merely educated guesses.",3,5/17/2018,Moona

I came for dinner with my mom and we ordered:Orange Blossom Lemonade 5/5Brussels Sprouts 3/5: they were good but nothing special Istanbul Grape Leaves 5/5Dips, Pickles, and Olives 4/5: not enough bread and I honestly would've preferred just regular pita. The labneh is really good, hummus is good, muhammara was okay. The pickled beets were my fav. Shiitake Mushroom Fatteh 5/5: probably my favorite dish of the night. It wasn't enough yogurt to really be a fatteh but delicious regardless. Chicken Bastilla 3/5: I thought it was okay but I just generally don't like Bastilla. My mom liked it more than I did. Lamb Tagine 0/5: absolutely disappointing and entirely inedible. It was so so salty I couldn't take more than one bite. I was really sad about it because I had come here before and ordered the Tagine and loved it. Kunafeh 3/5:  the only reason I came here the first time is because I saw they had kunafeh on their menu. It was good but a little on the sweeter side this time. I'll still come back and order it again. Overall, I love the food at Moona and I will keep coming back. The service is great (since the Tagine was too salty they comped both our desserts which was very nice of them). Also the complimentary bread and butter they bring out at the start of the meal is one of my favorite parts (that date molasses butter is incredible).",4,5/24/2018,Moona
458,"Nice design , excellent dishes , Brussels sprouts were with a twist I loved it. The Tehini cookies were really delicious! I ordered hot water with mint it was served in an authentic dishes.",4,6/3/2018,Moona
459,"Delicious food and good service. I went their twice and I was so happy to finally find a place like Moona that serve a very delicious Middle Eastern food! The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 because the last time when we went their and order the baharat chicken breast, some parts of the chicken was undercooked, we told the waitress about it and she just  said that she will let the chef know that and she took our plate away, somehow we were expecting that she would say they will give us another one but she did not. Other than that the place is really good and worth give it a try!",4,6/9/2018,Moona
460,"My partner and I eat out pretty frequently in Cambridge/Somerville/Boston and just came back from eight nights in Paris. With that context, I am comfortable saying that the meal we had last night at Moona was one of the best meals of my life and the culinary highlight of my year. The Eggplant Fatteh alone would have made my soul sing, but everything else we ordered was also perfection. Everything about this place is perfect. The food is amazing. The employees are delightful and intelligent and attentive. I am such a huge fan, and they made an anniversary even more special.",5,7/17/2018,Moona
461,"The food was really good, but my favorite part about Moona was the vibe/decor. It was a really small restaurant with just a few tables and a bar, so you would definitely have to make a reservation since it seemed to be constantly busy. We were a party of 7, so we basically took up half of the restaurant's seating. The inside was cute and cozy, and it's a chill place to hang out. The only thing is that it's pretty hard to get to. We were able to park right in front of the restaurant (no street parking from 8am-6pm), and we arrived right at 6pm. Otherwise, it would have been a pain to find parking, and the closest T stop (Central) was a 15min walk away. There were a few other restaurants on Hampshire Street and around the corner, so it was a pretty popping for a Thursday. The food was amazing. I got their off-menu roasted strawberry and jalapeño margarita, which was really good - sweet, a little spicy, and still fruity. We also got 2 bottles of red wine for the table, which I liked as well. For mezza, there were quite a few options, so we didn't know what to get. The server recommended the pickles and dips platter, which came with really good pita chips. They also gave us breads, oil, and a spread, and the seasoned bread was soo good. There were only 5 options for the entree, so it was easy to decide. I got the steak kebab, which was amazing. The steak was pretty rare, but it went well with the smokey vegetables. Other people got the lamb with couscous which looked really good. For dessert, I got the coconut almond cake. It was a little too sweet for me, but I still liked it. It was a pretty moist cake with lots of coconut, drenched in a sweet white sauce and a raspberry sauce. I was super stuffed at the end of the meal, and I would definitely come again. It's a bit on the pricier end though, which makes sense since it's such a small restaurant. The mezza was $16, and my entree was $26. Desserts were $5-10, and a drink was around $15. It could be worth it though.",4,8/10/2018,Moona
462,"Beatifful all around, and a great food quality. Moona is about great food and authentic presentation in an unpretentious atmosphere and genuine staff who are friendly and real! Five-star and I will go back!",5,8/11/2018,Moona
463,"Food was amazing!!! Our waitress recommended few things and we went with everything she said...it was all DELICIOUS!! The whole fish...OMG, best I've ever had!!! SO much flavor and just amazing, wish it came on a bed of couscous or maybe some rice..that would've made the dish complete. The tabouli salad was great and chicken bastille was different but tasty, my kids enjoyed it. We also had the eggplant dish, it's very flavorful, but should be listed under starter, not main course. Bread in the beginning is so good, love the presentation, and their butter was amazing!! FYI, there's no kids menu :-/",4,8/15/2018,Moona
464,"The food here was just incredible!  Fresh ingredients combined with interesting spices made for fabulous dishes.  We're vegetarians, and there were plenty of choices with the small plates, as well as one main dish.  We ended up getting two small plates, the crispy kale and the zucchini fritters and a main plate of eggplant and faro.  All were unique and delicious.  Staff was very nice and friendly.  It's a small place, so you should make a reservation.",5,9/8/2018,Moona
465,"You really should try this place. Beats Oleana by ten miles in taste, value and ambiance.  Deserts are brilliant as well.",4,9/24/2018,Moona
466,"I did a review on this place a year or so ago and it was in my top 5. I have been there at least 6-8 times and slowly seen the quality of this place roll downhill. I went back today and it was the straw that broke the camels back - won't be back . We got there for brunch and we ordered an app , the Arabic breakfast, Shakshuka, and the lamb sausage. We waited around 35-40 minutes to get a single dish to arrive. The app was a small salad with nothing cooked as a component. We asked the waitress if she knew the status of the food and about five to ten minutes later she brought over the app and the shakshuka. Then after another five the lamb sausage came out ( all very small portions). The rest of the party was completely finished with their meal by the time the waitress came over and said that there was an issue with the eggs on my dish and the chef needed to ""refire"". I got the Arabic breakfast for around $13 dollars which consisted of a single soft boiled egg, 5 slices of cucumber, a few olives and grape tomatoes, and  a tablespoon of hummus. How the hell does it take 45 minutes to prepare a soft boiled egg. My dish literally consisted of a single egg that needed to be half cooked. They offered to take a beverage off the tab (even after sending out my dish after everyone else at my table was completely done). We asked that my dish be taken off. I'm super disappointed with how this place has changed. Portion sizes are a literal joke and the prices somehow keep creeping up and up. Probably won't be back. Such a shame. Save yourself the time, money, and hunger pains and just go to Oleana.",2,10/7/2018,Moona
467,Rip-off!! I ordered a salad a a kabob for delivery ($34) and was stunned how small the portions were. Got one kabob with three pieces of meat for $16!! Never again from this place.,2,10/7/2018,Moona
468,"Way overpriced and the food is soaked in oil. Went out on a date here, I didn't like two of the four small plates. The octopus was bland and way underseasoned. Our plates came with chips that were oily and unpleasant. To give you an idea of how overpriced this place is, 5 tiny stuffed grape leaves were $15. The service and atmosphere was very nice.Mediocre food at premium prices. There are way better fine dining restaurants you can go to in Boston for these prices.",2,10/19/2018,Moona
469,We had reservations and we were sat at the bar! I asked the manager that we would wait for a table .. and he said for us to sit at the bar and he would call us to sit at a table soon one was available. Well ... a table was free and the manager looked right at me and sat another party! I also paid $12 for only two small scallops! K ... thanks,1,11/27/2018,Moona
470,"My fiancee's parents traveled to Boston to celebrate our engagement and we made a reservation to have dinner here. 20 minutes before the reservation time, we got a call from the restaurant advising us that we should arrive late, because we wouldn't be seated until 15 minutes after the time we had booked. We delayed our departure and arrived at the time they had suggested, but no tables were available. The hostess offered us water. After 15 minutes of waiting in a corner, a waitress offered us a menu. At that point, we left. It's one thing for a table to run behind (not something the restaurant can control) but it's inexcusable for multiple people who work in the service industry to not offer a comped drink or appetizer to guests who aren't seated 30 minutes after their reservation. We'll never try to eat there again.",1,12/1/2018,Moona
471,"This was my first time eating Mediterranean food. I have to say me and my mom were about to leave when Deborah the bartender approached us and took the time to explained almost everything on the menu, asking questions to find out our likes. She made sure to pair the right kind of wine and got my mom a great cocktail. Food was delicious but she definitely made our night. She went above and beyond in any way you can imagine. She will be the first reason to come back second the food. She's definitely a great asset to the business.",5,12/2/2018,Moona
472,"Huge let down. I have been wanting to try this place for ages and honestly I am very disappointed. We had:- hummus plate: really sour pickles and hummus is soso. Feta cheese is tooo salty. - mussel: over cooked small mussel- grape leaf: pretty good but only 4 small ones- potato: mehOverall it is very expensive, the portion is very small. Wine is 14 dollar and beer is 9 dollar.",2,12/19/2018,Moona
473,"Our Moona experience was so beautiful. We came here for dinner tonight and I can't wait to come back. I had been here previously when Moona first opened for a private Yelp Elite event. The food was wonderful then and the food is still wonderful now. It was my husband first time here and he was blown away by the service and by the delicious food. We sat at the bar because even though most of the tables were empty they were reserved for upcoming reservations. I wish the bar seats had bigger backs but the bar itself was lovely, as was the bartender and the bar decor. Our bartender made the best drinks. Moona stocks their bar with bitters and other mixologist dreams. I was made two cocktails and was asked properly what my cocktail preferences were. Both drinks were right on the mark. My favorite was the Viva Maskita. We ordered:1.) Dips, Pickles and Olives - 4 stars - absolutely beautiful presentation and is served with a bowl of pita chips 2.) Feta & Currant Fritters - 5 stars 3.) Chicken Msakhan Rolls - 5 stars - must order item, taste as if a chicken shawarma and an egg roll had a baby Inman square is a bit in the middle of nowhere but definitely come here for a great time. We will be back!!",5,12/27/2018,Moona
474,"I've been here three times, and every time the food has been great. The seasonings and preparations are unique, and make each dish exceptional. For New Years Eve dinner they served an amazing duck confit dish and some fritters that were delicious.. All the vegetable dishes I've tried are wonderful. One downside is the small kitchen, so dishes come out one or two at a time. It works best if you share dishes, so no one at your table is waiting too long. Also you get to try more dishes. Make reservations, and even if you do, you may sit at the bar. It's very small.",4,1/12/2019,Moona
475,"I have mixed feelings. To start, we had a 7:30PM reservation and when we got there there wasn't an open table in sight. There are only a handful of tables so I suggest always going with a reservation. We were placed at the bar for our reservation. I started with ""The Pear Necessities"" and I didn't love it. My high rating is because of the food. We started with the Dips, Pickles, and Olives. The dips were great and the chips that came with it were addicting. We also got the grape leaves that you don't usually see on a menu, but they were very flavorful. I then got the ""Roasted Beets"" entree and WOW. Every bite was 10/10. The quinoa had such a unique and delicious flavor. The chickpeas gave a nice crunch. It was amazing. My boyfriend got the Shish Tawouk which he really enjoyed. It came with brussel sprouts that were some of the best brussel sprouts I have ever had. Overall, I loved the food. I wish I could eat that food in a different setting. The decor is nice and clean; however, it is very small. I will go back, but won't be a regular.",4,1/15/2019,Moona
476,"Making a reservation does not mean that you will have a table to sit at. Even though we had reservations, all the tables were full, so we ended up sitting at the bar. The host told us that we could move to a table as soon as one opened up, but totally forgot to move us. Luckily, our bartended was cool, so I didn't mind sitting at the bar. Unfortunately we were seated near the door, so my ass got a little cold everytime somebody opened and closed the door. The restaurant is small and cozy, without that much seating, so I would definitely recommend making reservations. The cocktail list has a middle eastern twist- for example, they have the Marrakech negroni, and Air Mail from Beirut. There are also several beers on tap. I really like my wine so I had a glass of wine. This is what we ordered:-Brussels Sprouts: topped with pine nuts and tahini, and charred to perfection. -Chicken Msakahan Rolls: you get 2 pastry like rolls filled with chicken, they are absolutely delicious-Fattoush: this salad was delicious - Lamb Fasulia: the lamb was so tender that it literally  fell off the bone. You don't even need a knife to eat this -Dessert: halva ice cream. I had no idea what halva is but it tasted to try it anyways. Halva is a sesame and tahini ice cream that was not too sweet.Overall, this is a great place to have Middle Eastern food.",4,2/4/2019,Moona
477,"The food exceeded expectations. Not inexpensive, but well worth it. Loved the dips, pickles and olives plate to start. The grilled octopus was incredibly tender and tasty. I had the 'fezcal' cocktail which was complex and well balanced.",5,2/10/2019,Moona
478,Excellent service and great atmosphere. The food was delicious and the waitress was very hospitable. Highly recommend this restaurant.,5,2/17/2019,Moona
479,The service was friendly and very attentive . Didn't care for the fattush salad the portion was very small with very little cheese and sumac it should have been a garden salad with bland dressing I have had much better fattush at American restaurants with fresh parsley with bid pieces of pita chip generous cheese and sumac I was surprised to have this at an authentic Lebanese restaurant the quinoa salad and roasted beets was not tasty either but my husband loved the chicken kabob with Brussels sprout and the wine My entree and appetizer was disappointing the reason I am giving it a 4 star is the service and the kind manager who gladly gave a better table when we complained we were cold,4,3/17/2019,Moona
480,"I really expected this to be a better experience. I went with my friend on a Wednesday night. We did not want to drink, but still as we were not a group of 4 or more we had to sit at the bar. We ordered chicken meal and roast beet veggie meal. It took them almost about 50 mins to serve that. So obviously we were bored. And after all that wait, the food was just average. I mean that looked super impressive, but didn't taste great. I would not want to visit again. I must say, the servers and bartenders were friendly. But they need to step up their game!",3,4/10/2019,Moona

The 6 appetizers we ordered were great and the owner made sure we were happy all the way throughout our dining experience! We liked everything off the dinner menu and I was so happy to eat Muhalabiya (Arabic pudding) after it, because it took me back to my days in the Middle East! Don't miss it, wish they'd open another one in Boston!",4,4/26/2019,Moona
482,"Had a really wonderful first date here. The hostess was very kind and attentive, made some recommendations [holy smokes the grape leaves are SO good], and was patient with our awkward 'both-of-us-want-to-do-what-the-other-wants-to-do-and-be-all-gracious-and-polite-and-stuff-but-we-each-have-preferences-and-don't-know-how-to-go-about-that-so-it-just-took-us-extra-long-to-decide-what-two-plates-and-single-drink-we-wanted-to-share' thing. At one point, they asked if we could move tables to accommodate a larger party coming in [our immediate, obvious answer was 'Yes, of course!'] -- but they felt so bad about asking that they gave us those scrumptious grape leaves for free! Good stuff :) Just a twinge pricey [hence one star away from perfection], but at least we went splitsies. #firstdateequalityAll in all, great ambiance, wonderful food, friendly staff, and a lovely dinner experience for me and my new friend!",4,5/12/2019,Moona
483,"Damn good food, amazing service, reasonable price, and a wonderful atmosphere make this exactly the kind of place that deserves 5 stars.

484,"Went with a group of 8 total to celebrate a Tufts graduation. We had reservations. Extremely knowledgeable server who was fine with making drink recommendation- she was completely right that the drink would be great. As we were new to the restaurant, she explained how best to order. Everything that we had- hummus, octopus, pita and za'atar bread (much better than I make), olives, grape leaves, lamb marguez (spicy!), chicken tagine (one of my favorites), monkfish tagine, and especially the slow cooked lamb shoulder was so flavorful and well cooked. You know the service is good when they are more than willing to return the Turkish Coffee because it was not hot enough and return with a fresh steaming cup. In addition, the chef was very nice and was able to take some time to explain what was in that slow roasted lamb so I can attempt to recreate rather than flying to Boston to dine there. Big Wow and thank you!",5,5/20/2019,Moona
485,"(Note: this visit was earlier this year, so the items I tried on the menu may no longer be available on the current menu.)Moona is in Cambridge, located at Inman Square, just past the Somerville line.  Not quite my neck of the woods, so it took me a while to finally go here.I scored the parking spot right in front of Moona since I was just a few minutes late for our 6pm reservation, and parking opens up around here at 6pm according to the posted signs.They are a small place up two steps from the sidewalk, with a scattering of tables with nearly 20 seats and a line of stools by the bar.  Reservations are accepted.  For larger party reservations a credit card is requested.They'll take your jackets and give you a paper slip to exchange back for it later.  Given the tightness of the space, this is a nice convenience that they offer.Service was cheerful and pleasant.  Napkins are folded whenever they notice you have stepped away from the table.The menu is short with 10 Mezza (think tapas) and 4 Daily Meals (entrees; we were told they may be 3x a mezza).  It was suggested that we order 2-3 Mezzas per person.Tip - keep a menu, that way you can read and see the description of the dish after it arrives at the table.  I loved the glossary that was included in the menu!They started us off with some bread and flavored butter.  The bread was in small flat tender squares (zaatar bread according to another Yelp review).  The butter was terrific - a delicious date molasses honey butter the color of caramel.. Pan Seared Sea Scallops (beet, citrus, herbs) $14. Brussels Sprouts (tahini, barberries, pine nuts, coriander) $10. Octopus (fennel yogurt, lemon relish) $18. Daily Special - eggplant with poached tomatoes $9(?). Chicken Musakhan Rolls (sumac, pomegranate tahini) $12. Fattoush (greens, pear, shanklish, hazelnuts, lemon, pom molasses) $13. Dips, Pickles & Olives (hummus, zaalouk, labneh) $16 which is accompanied by light crisp pita chipsPhotos to be posted later will better show the portion size.  The two large scallops were beautifully seared, fat and juicy.  Brussels sprouts were terrific.  The octopus tenacle was plump and tender, and well cooked even to the tip.  Twin slices of eggplant were served alongside two skinless little tomato spheres.  The Chicken rolls arrived at a perfect count of 4 bundles for our party of 4, with a surprisingly tender wrapping around the meaty filling.  The Fattoush was a refreshing though sparse salad.  The dips were the fun ending as we dipped the chips into the various spreads.  The chips were nice and light, so we appreciated the willing refills.For your choice of sweet endings, there are two:Ice cream/Sorbet (Halawa, Sahlab, Pear Cardamom) $4Chocolate Tahini Tart $8 sour cherry, pistachioWe shared the tart and found it rich and chocolatey.A nice meal for not that little money, so a bit of a splurge or special occasion spot.A single private bathroom is located to the left, and it has a cool faucet.Noted at the bottom of their menu:20% Gratuity will be added to parties of 6 or more.3% Kitchen Service Fee will be added to every bill for our Kitchen Team",4,5/22/2019,Moona
486,"I loooove this place. This review is for my second time coming here (this time with 2 friends). Last time I came was in 2016 (around when they opened) and the food was amazing (a little pricey for me but this time we came on someone else's dime!).Drink: I started off with the High Noon 'specialty drink' - dry gin, Moroccan mint tea, and green chartreuse ($13). Amazingly refreshing. There was a sprig of mint as decoration, which I promptly mashed/muddled with my straw, adding an extra punch of flavor. Great summer drink! Very mojito-y and didn't taste too strong but left me with a buzz. We were also offered tap water to drink.Main dishes:- warm olives ($5); nothing super special about this. I wish they served pita bread without us having to ask. Had a bit of acute salt overload. Pita bread came with maple butter though (not sure how weird this is but 5 stars, tasted very good). Probs wouldn't bother w the olives again.- (!!) Feta + currant fitters w/ orange blossom honey and fleur de sel ($10). Wow this is to die for, I've never had anything like it before. The texture is really interesting, and the flavors combo really pops. I probably should have waited for it to cool down a bit more. Def would get again!- Chicken liver mousse w/ orange blossom cracker and sesame walnut mastic fig jam ($10). I think this was decent but nothing amazing. I didn't really get the orange blossom from the cracker, or sesame flavor from the fig jam. This dish managed to win over my friend who was actively trying to stop me from order chicken liver mousse, so thumbs up for that!- soft shell crab ($16). Came w/ a lot of garnish, not sure what was what but there was a blanket of citrus. Crab was done to a great texture but for some reason I wasn't that blown away by this dish. Good experience, wouldn't get again.- monkfish tagine w/ parsnip, mussels ($28). soooo much flavor and citrus. Kind of in a bad way, like borderline overwhelming. I probably wouldn't get this again? It probably would have gone better w a side like rice or bread, but it was served on its own. - (!!!!!!) slow cooked lamb shoulder ($32). This lamb is to DIE FOR! Falling apart, beautiful flavor. I will feel sad for anyone who comes here and does not order it. highly highly highly recommend. This is one of those dishes where the garnishes went well with it, didn't overpower it, and were not memorable because the lamb itself was the star.Dessert:I love when I go places with friends that want to share dishes so we can try more and more stuff. We got 3 separate plates to share and devoured them all!- Knafeh (shredded buttered phyllo) w/ sweet cheese and bosson simple ($8). this one was my least favorite, maybe also my fault b/c I was expecting something with more of a bite. It was very soft and mild in flavor. I think a touch of salt and some more crunch on the top layer would have been better.- Halawa ice cream scoop ($4). Also ok, nothing memorable here for me.- Farro pudding w dried fruit, cinnamon, creme fraiche ($8). I would definitely get this again, it was really refreshing and had a nice texture. The fruit was a nice sweet touch and the plating was cute!Service:Overall, the dishes were great and we left with smiles and happy bellies. I will say it probably would have been easier to share these dishes w/ an even-numbered group of people, and we did a lot of awkward portion rationing. I also want to note that the waitresses were super cheery all throughout service :)",5,6/5/2019,Moona
487,"One of the other reviewers put it best:  ""mediocre food at premium prices"". This place is a bit of a head scratcher.  You generally want the plate to correlate somehow to the price:  either in quality, portion, etc.  it's almost random here.  The plates are comically undersized and not in the way that each bite is so shockingly rich that it makes sense. For instance,  the lamb shoulder ($30+) was just three cubes of lamb, much of which seemed to be suet.  Generously, each cube was maybe 1.5-2"", so about 2-4oz of lamb (fat).  And again, this wasn't the best lamb you tasted, or cooked to perfection or anywhere near.  The lamb was a tough--knives ricocheting off the plate.  Really not sure what the restaurant is thinking. Would not recommend not go back.",2,6/25/2019,Moona

There were a few little things that weren't quite ideal: 1) our server didn't want to take no for an answer on alcoholic drinks, and asked us so often it became almost silly; and 2) for a place whose biggest recommendation to their visitors is to order their spreads, they bring you very little bread, and it's cold and generic.",4,12/14/2019,Moona

There are certainly better options in the Inman Square area where better eats and a more relaxed atmosphere can be found at a much lower price point.",2,1/5/2020,Moona

499,"Moona is absolutely delicious.  The ambiance is great not too loud, not too stuffy and the well designed. The waitstaff were friendly and offered great recommendations. Went with a friend and we ordered:Istanbul grape leaves: The leaf itself had nice texture and flavor. My friend who is Lebanese thinks it's one of the best versions of grape leaves they've been able to have in the Boston- Cambridge area.Feta and currant  fritters:  these were fiyah. They were warm and creamy with a nice flavor, reminded me of a upscale Mediterranean mozzarella stick. Would come back just for the fritters.Seasonal fattoush: very light and tasty the radicchio gives a nice bite. Pretty unique flavors and also definitely worth coming back for.Brussel sprouts: it's a no from me. Although they had char they weren't crispy enough. Imagine flavorful and soggy Brussel sprouts. Nah.Labneh with fig and walnut: it was solid, not sure of the choice of bread as it requires work to chew, also I felt that the bread could have been served warm. The labneh itself was nice thick and tangy and the fig a nice sweet juxtaposition.Overall good experience and great food.",4,2/2/2020,Moona
500,"This is a really cute place and the food was very good!! It's a bit on the pricey side so not sure how often I'll be back, but definitely a good option for a nice dinner in Inman square!",4,2/3/2020,Moona
501,Ordered a variety of different vegetarian items off of the menu for an anniversary dinner and everything was delicious! The delivery came packed in cute little labeled boxes and containers. Favorites included the fritters and fatteh!,5,5/2/2020,Moona
502,"I'm back again to Moona. I love this place truly. Great food. Most importantly great people. I really like the bar manager Hassan, super friendly and knowledg about the drinks. Gerrit is super nice and helpful too. Their dishes never disappoint, and they got a good selection of drinks too! High recommend!",5,7/17/2020,Moona
503,"First time trying - ordered earlier in the day via ToastTab on their website for an evening pick up, and it couldn't have been easier...Double parked in front and the brought it right out once I called to let them know I was here. Ordered 2 Tzatziki, grape leaves, falafel, the Mashawee ""Mixed Grill,"" and extra side of pita. Everything was honestly delicious! At first I didn't know if the Tzatziki needed more flavor but once I started pairing it with things, it complimented everything really well and definitely would have been too overwhelming if it had more lemon, salt, etc. Looked like the have a nice patio, too.",5,7/22/2020,Moona
504,This place is some of the best food I've had in New England!! The next grill is incredible! And the cocktails pair perfect! They also have great ambiance of string lights and well spaced outdoor seating with staff wearing masks and being safe. Definitely returning!,5,8/8/2020,Moona
505,"The outdoor seatings is super cute with baby blue drapes, twinkle lights, and pinkish red flowers. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. I enjoy eating family style and this place is perfect for that. You get to share and try lot of yummy food. I came here with a friend and we ordered feta fritters and grilled squid salad for starters. Then for entree we ordered grilled whole fish and lentils. Break down: You just have to order the feta fritters. They are so good. The waiter told us if we haven't ordered that he would've told us to. It is really that good. Crispy on the outside but smooth (like mashed potatoes texture) on the inside. The grilled squid salad was had a citrus lemon flavor to it, perfectly paired with the fritters. The avocado with the lemon flavor was perfect to keep it this dish light. There was a good amount of squid, perfect for every bite. I really appreciate that they don't skim on the seafood here compared to other places. Tastes like summer indeed. The lentils were recommended by the waiter to pair with the grilled whole fish we ordered. The creaminess of the tzarziki with the pickled veggies on the side with the lentils balanced each other well. Lastly the grilled whole fish was good but I think it was a bit over cooked cause it was a bit dry. I think it could've used a drizzle of evoo. Overall the food here was really good, I definitely will come back here.",4,8/8/2020,Moona
506,We ended up at Moona by accident and we were glad for it. We had dinner here and couldn't be happier with the service. The appetizers were delicious and I had a chicken tagine that was to die for.,5,10/8/2020,Moona
507,"Great good, drinks, service & the outdoor seating right now is very pleasant; off the street and very warm from the several heat lamps",5,10/23/2020,Moona
508,"This place is so special. Amazing food, intimate environment, so much care in each delicious high quality dish, and lovely owners.",5,11/3/2020,Moona
509,"This restaurant has become our new favorite, even though it is not close to home.  The staff is amazing, the food is creative and delicious, and the outdoor setting is particularly attractive during this Covid era.  They also do wonderful takeout.  We had an amazing New Year's Eve takeout dinner which reheated beautifully!  Great all round experience!",5,1/1/2021,Moona
510,"Wonderful menu; great staff...really cool vibe about the place...menu is well-curated; everything's done well; lives up to its promise without being at all prestentious.  Great patio for being Covid-safe; appropriately sized portions for Mediterranean.  Remember Rendesvouz in Central Sq...think of this as a younger, Somerville cousin.   Good job on cocktail menu.",4,1/9/2021,Moona
511,Spectacular!!!!! What a feast Moona delivered tonight!!! Beets. Salad. Falafel. Chicken shish. Fritters. Lamb burgers. OMG. EVERYTHING DELICIOUS AND FRESH AND YUMMY. We cannot wait for the next time! Thanks for helping us all eat great during these tough times!!!,5,1/23/2021,Moona
512,"We love this restaurant.  Even during COVID-19 when we get only curbside, the food is incredibly well prepared, flavorful, and amazing.  Entrees are delicious (never had a bad tangine there, whatever the base is), and the small plates are fabulous. Travels well, too. Lovely staff.",5,2/12/2021,Moona
513,Moona offers lunch take-out on Thursdays and Fridays. I finally remembered this today and ordered chicken tangine for pick-up. The meal was so good. Definitely will order from this restaurant again!,5,3/5/2021,Moona
514,"Excellent spot.... the whole fish was outstanding and service was A+.The overall winner was the bartender, drinks and his attention to detail.The MUST NOT MISS is the cheesecake. It's unique and very tasty. Overall great experience with a fun atmosphere.",5,3/7/2021,Moona
515,So very tasty! Friendly service too. The hummus plate was so good. So glad we come here tonight .,5,3/25/2021,Moona
516,Absolutely delicious. Great combination of traditional and innovative. The whole fish was especially delicious. The tahini cheesecake was out of this world,5,5/2/2021,Moona
517,I loved this restaurant but Ana at the bar made the experience so much better!!! I will definitely be coming back to see her,3,5/21/2021,Moona
518,"One of the gems of the Cambridge/Somerville areas. Moona is consistently delicious, with exceptional service, great cocktails, and authentic and interesting mezze plates. 100% worth a visit, especially for a special occasion or date night.",5,5/22/2021,Moona
519,"We picked this restaurant for our first post-pandemic dinner and my partner's birthday. We had made a reservation for the patio but because of the rain we got a call a few hours earlier to let us know that we would not be able to sit outside and we could move the reservation to the bar indoors. That was fine, the bar was comfortable and the place is very cute inside.  I think we ordered a bit too much food (or we're not used to dining out anymore?)  but it was delicious for the most part. I particularly enjoyed the Feta Fritters and the Eggplant Fatteh, and the Chicken Tagine was very good too. We didn't love the Grilled Squid & Kale though - too salty. Staff was super friendly and attentive, and they brought us a little birthday baklava, which was a lovely surprise. We will be coming back!",4,5/30/2021,Moona
520,"Recently ate here on a weeknight with a couple of friends. We enjoyed a warm evening on the patio, which has a lovely ambience. We ordered several small mezze platters (dip plate, feta fritters, falafel, eggplant fatteh, fattoush). We shared the halva cheesecake for dessert. Everything was delicious and presented beautifully. The prices are definitely on the higher end, but I don't think that will stop me from returning!",4,6/24/2021,Moona
521,Great drinks and good shareable plates! Got the Korkom&Carrot and it was so good they ran out of it by the end of the night.,5,6/24/2021,Moona
522,"So glad this place survived the pandemic so we could discover them. Had the chicken tagine package for 2. Amount of food was great for me and my fiancée and I eat a lot. The food was great too, especially the chicken tagine which was unbelievably tasty!  Food rarely gets me going like that stuff did - one of the most perfectly flavorful things I've ever eaten.  Felt like the food critic eating ratatouille in the movie.  This is I think my second yelp review lifetime but I had to pay my respects, it's just that good.",5,7/3/2021,Moona
523,"Great grilled fish! Really enjoyed the place and the food! Also order some rice with it, really elevates the dish!",5,7/15/2021,Moona
524,"TLDR: Delicious food & drinks, really great service, good vibes all aroundLoved everything about Moona - the drinks are delicious (I recommend the carrot cocktail), the food is outstanding, and the cheesecake was to die for. We were four people which was the perfect amount to sample a good chunk of the menu. The food came out at a perfect pace and the drinks were all creative and tasty. I am already looking forward to my next visit!",5,7/28/2021,Moona
525,The food and drink were better than I expected. Menu could use more additions though. The service was impeccable and the ambience was great!,5,8/24/2021,Moona
526,"Excellent food in a charming setting. The feta fritters were to die for, but everything we ordered tasted delicious. (Mixed grill, squid and kale, eggplant...). The service was surprisingly good given how short staffed they were. I would highly recommend this place. We went out there for a ladies night out and had a fabulous time.",5,9/16/2021,Moona
527,"We ordered delivery tonight from Moona.  Like every other time (6), it was absolutely fabulous.  Just beautiful cooking, subtle yet complex, and generous.  Consistently awesome, we offer our highest praise and recommendation.",5,10/12/2021,Moona
528,"Wow, this place is incredible. The food was both delicious and hearty, and the staff is absolutely lovely. Honestly, everything was fabulous, and the whole place feels really cozy. The chicken tagine was perfectly tender and rich, and the knafeh dessert was standout. The cocktails also looked fab, can't wait to come back to try them!",5,10/22/2021,Moona
529,"Great is an understatement. Moona's food is absurdly good. The service including both the host, bartender and servers were extremely fast, flexible and just generally really nice.  In particular, the marinade, spices and just quality of all the meats we ate on the mixed grill and other dishes were just beyond. This chef is phenomenal. Others have said this but the cheesecake is both delicious and has a really satisfying crust. We didn't get a chance to have the cocktails this time around but will be back. Stop reading. You found the place to eat, go now.",5,12/11/2021,Moona
530,"Made a reservation, super nice staff and attentive service. The food is well done middle eastern style. The owners are Lebanese. The portions are on the small side and the prices are high. Otherwise, this is a great spot. I would go back.",4,12/18/2021,Moona
531,"A few friends and I ordered take out on New Years Eve. We made sure to order way earlier in the day because we knew it would be busy. Long story short, the food wasn't ready until 30m after the time we had selected and it felt like everyone who came in to pick up take out was waiting a little longer than anticipated. That being said, once we got the food it was delicious! My very favorite dish was the feta fritters. We also loved the bbq steak tips and the Brussels sprouts. The chicken shish tawouk didn't have quite as much flavor as I had hoped for, but was still good. I would definitely come back, but maybe not on a super busy night.",4,1/1/2022,Moona
532,"Most frustrating experience at a restaurant. I had a reservation at 9pm, we got there at 8:45pm. We didn't mind waiting, we got seat at 9:30pm. Afterwards, we sat there for 30 minutes waiting to order. We put our order in at 10pm and the food came out 30 min later. The food was okay but I didn't like how it took. The waiting staff had a lot of tables but they were very attentive to other tables. I wouldn't go again because of the amount of time it took. The food lacked flavor and no spice.",1,1/14/2022,Moona
533,"(Delayed review! Sorry!) So...we definitely built this place up in our head. And there were some ups and downs but we ended on a high note!Showed up excited to order the lamb burgers and octopus. Decided we would wait to see how the portion sizes went before moving on. I had also seen a lovely couple of reviews about the carrot based cocktail so...easy choice. I loved the cocktail, but my partner didn't - to each their own? The burgers were amazing, and easily our favorite. Octopus is something we try anywhere it's available and it was fine, but we might end up trying something different if we come back. Cute and cozy date night!",4,2/18/2022,Moona
534,"Been to this place a few times and have loved it every time. They have great food and quick service. Make sure to try the Eggplant Fatteh, you won't regret it.",5,2/19/2022,Moona
535,Great cozy neighborhood spot with delicious food. The only issue is their measured wine pours.. it's the little things that make a difference!,4,3/2/2022,Moona
536,"Absolutely incredible! Our 3rd time here and never disappoints. Food is prompt, flavorful and so delicious. The feta fritters were amazing, as was the eggplant fate and the duckrolls and the dip platter.  Just perfect!  We had varied cocktails and mocktails--each one with fresh squeezed juices and herbs. Our bartender was so fun and attentive and the cheesecake was phenomenal. Cant wait to return!!",5,3/2/2022,Moona
537,"A must-try for Mediterranean! I just tried this place out, and I was very pleased with the delicious food. I went on a Tuesday night, and it was packed! They have a 90-minute duration policy for keeping your table, and they need it because they are so busy. We ordered three appetizers: feta fritters, grape leaves, and dips plate. My favorite was the feta fritters because who doesn't love fried cheese?!? For the entrees, we got the chicken tagine and the fish. The chicken was delicious! It was so moist and had a great flavor. It had potatoes and carrots roasted in the juices, and they were a nice touch for the entree. I would definitely go back for those two dishes. Yummy!",5,3/2/2022,Moona
538,"The wait staff and hostess completely ruined our entire vibe tonight. Incredibly rude, rushed our meal and left the door open in the freezing cold for 20 minutes so we would leave the restaurant. Host didn't even bring us to our table and took our food off the table before we could say we weren't done. It was my birthday and I wanted to experience a good vibe, however, that wasn't the case. Food was great, but won't go again due to rude service.",2,3/19/2022,Moona
539,"A friend recommended Moona for our anniversary dinner and boy, we are so happy we found this spot! Not only did the hostess wish us a happy anniversary as we walked in, they even surprised us with two glasses of champagne. We were blown away. This spot is adorable, the staff is so friendly, the cocktails are top-notch and the food is incredible. We can't wait to go back!",5,6/16/2022,Moona
540,"Food: Overall, good food! Definitely more of a tapas place so the portions are small ,so we got dessert after heheh. This Hallawa Cheesecake was BOMB though. Definitely a special occasion kind of place though because it is PRICEY. Good place for drinks for sure! Location: It's a bit of a walk from the Red Line but Kendall Square is such a fun area!! Great walking path super near the Charles.",4,6/18/2022,Moona
541,"I came here with my father on a chill Wednesday night. We got outdoor seating immediately. The servers were really attentive: One of them came up to me and asked if I would like a to try a pomegranate lemonade from the bar--not on the menu, just a nice thought. Of course I said yes; it was really refreshing, so I'm glad I did. My father and I ordered a variety of dishes from the small plates section of the menu. Our favorite by far was the eggplant fatteh. It was so creamy offset by a tzaziki sauce with lots of soft eggplant and crunchy pita chips. The combination of flavors and textures was perfect. Our close second was the feta fritters. They were the perfect amount of crispy on the outside and pillowy on the inside. We also got the carrots which were really good. Perfectly cooked carrots with a lovely sweet and smokey glaze. Then the chicken castillan; a little dry but flavorful and filling. We were still a little hungry so we ended up ordering the pomegranate fattoush, of which neither of us were a fan. It was so overwhelmingly sour and kinda burned the tongue. For dessert the waiter suggested the cheesecake, which he said was made directly by the chefs. It consisted of a crumbly graham cracker crust and dense cheesecake and chocolate mousse. It was a little too decadent for me, though others might enjoy it. Overall, the service was excellent and there were some dishes that really stood out. I would come here again to try the rest of the menu and for the eggplant fatteh.",4,7/15/2022,Moona
542,"Delicious, inventive food, and great service in an intimate setting. Make sure to make a reservation during busy times!",5,7/19/2022,Moona
543,"They gave us moldy pita bread, and I'm still giving 5 stars. Cocktails and beer menu hit the spot, service and food were all so quick despite a dinner rush that filled the restaurant inside and out. The food.. Lamb Burger Baba Hummus Lebnah Grape Leaves Taklia Potatoes  and the mixed grill (lamb, chicken, beef)Ps. The moldy pita bread is less than ideal, but they gave us new pita bread and complimentary baklava so all is forgivin in my eyes.",5,7/23/2022,Moona
544,"Doesn't look like much when you walk past, but I was practically dying of hunger so I walked in. The definition of hole-in-the-wall. This place is incredible!",5,8/3/2022,Moona
545,"Came here last night, with my husband and another couple.Ambiance: On point, small and intimate spot relatively modern and lively. 4.5/5Food: Amazing, fresh, and clean mezze spot! Our favorites were the lamb sliders ( so freaking good), the dip plate, falafel, and the eggplant fatteh. The falafel was so yummy and moist and the eggplant fatteh was fresh and well balanced with textures. The feta fritters were a little too sweet for my taste, but the harissa carrots were well flavored. The mixed grill platter after all the apps was plenty for the four of us and well cooked (check out my photos) - rating for food 5/5Service: This is where the four came into effect during our experience. For most of our dinner our service was solid and the individuals we had were kind and attentive, but towards the end despite us continually ordering bottles of wine and pretty much every Mezze on the menu, we were rushed to finish and leave. The waitress asked us for ""our next move"" since she said we had already overstayed and there was another group waiting. Issue with that is that we weren't just sitting there- we were actively ordering, eating, and drinking. The restaurant needs to be able to accommodate groups in some part even if they're taking a little more time than average. After that we didn't want dessert and promptly left. 3.5-4/5",4,8/6/2022,Moona
546,"Very tasty tapas bar. We had the steamed mussels, lamb sliders, calamari salad and Fatoush Salad. I think the mussels were my favorite dish by far!",5,8/23/2022,Moona
547,"Delicious menu, great staff, amazing drinks; lovely atmosphere. We came with no knowledge except reading other reviews and this place exceeded our expectations. Food was mouth-teringly good and each bit was jam packed with flavor. Loved the small plates for sharing. And the hostess/owner comped delicious desserts for us when the second round of drinks took a little while to come even though we weren't at all put out. Very gracious kind staff and team. Will come here again for sure!",5,9/11/2022,Moona
548,"Small and cute restaurant. I would highly recommend it as a place to meet up with friends for a casual drink and small tapa dishes to snack on or even a date. Although we had a reservation they were pretty packed and probably backed up a little. Service was pretty good- servers were informative and gave us good recommendations. Obviously street parking and tough to find cause it's Cambridge. We got the Fattoush, feta fritters, msakhan duck roll, and mashawee. My favorite was by far the msakhan duck roll- the markouk is fried almost like a Chinese spring roll- flaky, but not as light as a spring roll. The steak that came with the mashawee was pretty good- juicy. The fattoush salad was a good refreshing balance. The servers were constantly recommending the carrots so next time I def. want to try that.",5,9/30/2022,Moona
549,Nice service. Beautiful decor. Creative and healthy dish. Art. I ordered a grilled whole fish and realized that there were many bones. Would be better if I was reminded of bones in advance.,4,10/5/2022,Moona
550,"I just moved to Inman square last month and I've been trying to visit Moona since! The outdoor seating always looks so enticing with cute 2-person tables and pretty cocktails. My roommates and I paid a visit on Friday night and even without a reservation, they were able to seat us at the bar, which was great because we were in it for the pretty drinks! The bartender was very friendly and happily showed us his mixes and explained their rotation. We chatted for a while over our first round, and we ordered the sweet potato with maple topping and somehow it went beautifully with our drinks! For the second round, we let the bartender go off-piste and he made the 3 of us each a delicious drink, adding his own flair to all of them! He even enticed us to order a dessert and the cheesecake was heavenly. We will definitely return, it feels pricey until you try their fair and realize it's exactly the right point. Glad to have a new local spot in the repertoire!",5,10/16/2022,Moona
551,"Add this one to your list of must tries. If for nothing else, the cumin/turmeric carrots. The mussels were totally amazing too. we just got apps, but everything was incredible!",5,10/20/2022,Moona
552,"Found Moona while scrolling through some Instagram reels and decided to go for a visit this past June! Was a relatively packed night when we went, but the food was served relatively quickly.Specific food review:Hummus Plate (4/5) - definitely a good variety of dips to choose from and had us trying all the possible flavor combinations!",4,11/2/2022,Moona
553,We're so glad we got a table at Tori Jiro this afternoon. It might have been a soft opening but the staff definitely gave us a grand welcome. The service were accommodating (got two little roommates/mini people) and fast even though it was busy.The food was fantastic and frankly felt as if we had a custom menu pairing. Big props to the tasty yakitori selections and seafood. The batter used for the fried squid/ shrimp was light and delish. Big TU to the staff and J. Cai.,5,8/29/2021,Tori Jiro
554,"So glad I stumbled across Tori Jiro on Instagram! I was able to try their food during their soft opening and it was AMAZING!Tori Jiro is currently taking RESERVATIONS ONLY for parties of 6 and less! Plenty of parking outside and in the garages at the Arsenal Yards!Food here are PERFECT for sharing in small groups! Definitely feel free to check in with staff on portions, theyre very nice :) Their drinks were delicious! They were flavorful and was perfectly paired with the food :) I LOVED everything that we ordered! Everything came quickly, super hot and crispy! I loved that the tokoyaki had many pieces of octopus! Most places are super frugal about theirs! The chicken karaage stay super crispy throughout our stay here. DEFINITELY get the shrimp pops here, they're crispy and super hot but so well flavored! We got the nori fries and some yakitori as well! All was just perfect!They're super new in town but they have already set such a high standard. I was very very satisfied with everything I was served! I'm definitely planning my next trip back! :)",5,9/7/2021,Tori Jiro
555,"Just to preface, Tori Jiro is only taking reservations through email. Went at 8pm on a Friday night. All tables were filled. If you want seating that is more spaced out, not the place to go. Tables are right next to each other and other parties are sitting less than 1 foot away from you. Now onto the yakitori, because that's why you're coming here right? Ordered 3 each of the chicken thigh, chicken meatball, hanger steak, and pork belly yakitori. Yakitori doesn't have any char because they do not use binchotan (japanese charcoal), instead is cooked by a heating element. All skewers came out at the same time. At most, the temperature of the food was a bit warmer than body temperature. Meat is cooked well, stays juicy but not as tender as I'd like. The sauce that came on the yakitori tastes pretty good. The yakitori is not grilled with the sauce on the meat to get that nice caramelization. Overall don't love it, don't hate it. Not worth at the price of around $3.50-$4.50 per skewer. Worth it at half that price. On the bright side, we ordered the chicken karaage as an appetizer. Came out crisp and juicy with a side of kewpie to dip in. Would recommend going there to get this. Also, no takeout at this time of review.",3,9/11/2021,Tori Jiro
556,"It is great we could make reservations during its soft opening. The location is good and there are public parking lots and also has a multi-leveled garage. The special menu for the soft opening is limited and that's the reason I put 4 stars only. We ordered different yakitori and hot appetizers. Overall, all foods tasted good especially the chicken karaage and yakitori hanger steak. We are looking forward to their full opening.",4,9/12/2021,Tori Jiro
557,"The skewers were great.  I highly recommend the hanger steak and Tsukune.    The chicken karage came out golden and moist.  Imho, it was perfect.  The Ika skewers and shrimp pop came out crispy.  They didn't have some of the vegetables but that's okay for a soft opening.The drinks were okay.  We love that they were able to offer alternatives to things they ran out of.  We got there with minimal patrons but later in the evening, it started to fill up.  The establishment isn't big so tables are definitely not 6' apart or equipped with dividers.  The staff still needs to work out some kinks but overall the experience was great.  I hope they stick around.",5,9/18/2021,Tori Jiro
558,"Don't hate it but don't love it either. The waiter was very nice but the food was average. Yakitori:We got the chicken thighs, meatballs, and zucchini. The meat was tender and juicy but no carmelization. It was drenched in the sauce afterwards but it basically all tasted the same. Definitely not worth $3-4 per stick. Curry Donburi:The flavor was ok but it was lukewarm. Also the rice was not hot and had a shiny appearance as if it was sitting out for a while. Ika Karaage:Probably my fav dish in this meal! It was very crispy and tasty. Takoyaki:This was good too, maybe second favorite. I know they just opened so I'd be willing to try it again. But as of this first encounter, nothing special and definitely does not compare to the yakitori places I've grown up with in NYC/LA.",3,9/30/2021,Tori Jiro
559,"I experienced one of the worst customer service here in my life. I wish I was overreacting, but I am not. We (party of 2) arrived there at 6:15pm and put our names down on the waiting list. When we asked how long the wait would be, we were told 30 minutes. So we were like, awesome. We waited 30 minutes, but no phone call. So we go to the store, and there's a bunch of other parties waiting too, so we thought okay, maybe they are just super busy and it would be an extra 10~15 minutes wait. So we're waiting... and waiting... and then at this point it was 7:20pm. We've been waiting over an hour. Still no call. So we go inside the store and see how much longer it would be. They tell us there's four more parties ahead of us. And by now you can probably tell we were really excited to try this place because I was just really excited for this authentic Japanese place to be opening up near us (and before you ask, yes, I'm Japanese). So we waited a bit longer. At 7:40pm, we went inside the store again, and after waiting inside the store for 5 minutes, we gave them their name, and they said ""Oh... yes you can sit here"" and seated us! We were so happy to finally be inside, and we were excited to order. And then... we waited a bit more. We saw other people getting what they wanted to eat. And we waited even more. At this point, we got seated and were waiting for our orders to be taken for 15 min. We tried to get the servers attention. We really tried. But its like they didn't care and they didn't want us for customers. The worst part is that we were near the ordering kiosk computer and we overheard one of the servers complaining about how people kept coming into the store to ask how long the wait would be every 5 minutes.Well, maybe if they gave a more accurate waiting time, this wouldn't happen.Also, we walked out of the store at 8:05pm. Waiting for our order to be taken for 20 minutes was too much. We went to the Buttermilk & Bourbon next door instead. They are so much more professional :)",1,10/2/2021,Tori Jiro
560,"Was excited to try this place as it is the first location in the USA.Kaarage: Crispy and came out piping hot. Mayo on the side was nice and the chicken was tender and juicy. Highlight of the mealTakoyaki: Solid, but you only get 5-6 balls for $10 so it was a bit overpriced. Quality was similar to a typical Japanese izakaya restaurant so it was good.Finally, we had ordered skewers, but it took over 30 minutes to receive them. I think the staff was having issues with fulfilling orders so we had waited quite a long time. They have an open kitchen so I would periodically watch the chefs at the grill. Two people were at the grill but only one person was making skewers... The skewers were okay, but not too thrilled with the wait.At a certain point, we just wanted to eat the skewers and get out, but once we got the bill we were informed credit card payments were down and to leave our credit card information to pay. Overall, I think the food was fine, but the service brought the meal down. Hopefully if I come back, I will have a better experience.",2,10/9/2021,Tori Jiro
561,Had really high hopes for this place. Advertisement said first US location I was hoping that would mean some bad ass flavors from the country of origin. To start this place is crazy expensive even without drinks. When the food comes out and you see such lame dishes as breaded squid and French fries it just lets you down. The chicken skewers we good but could not save the rest of the small boring food offerings.,2,10/14/2021,Tori Jiro
562,"Honestly, I was really excited to come here and try it because I missed a good yakitori place but honestly I left leaving disappointed.Food: Yakitori:The yakitori was mediocre but it was definitely overloaded on sauce which made it all taste the same and has no smoky element. At one point, I just didn't want to eat it anymore.Curry rice and shrimp pops:Both The curry rice and shrimp pops were okay but nothing too special.Ramen:We couldn't try the ramen because they sold out of it so that was extremely disappointing.Overall the food was mediocre but nothing too special.Now, the main issue I had was the service. This place does not have good service and was extremely disappointing.When my friends and I first got here, we were told to wait outside and someone would get us once the table was wiped down, no one came to get us after 15 minutes and then they started seating people that came after us and almost gave our table away. ( when we got there there was no one else waiting, just us). Luckily one of my friends was aggressive enough to just take the table so they couldn't give it to another party. Ordering food and drinks came swiftly but it took a really long time just to get drinks and food. Refills also took a long time which started to get on my nerves. Overall, the food here is nothing special and the service is horrible. You're better off going somewhere else.",2,10/16/2021,Tori Jiro
563,"My girlfriend and I noticed the sign when we were crossing the road fromBest Buy and knew we had to try it out. We've both been to Japan and were aching to have some decent yakitori. We managed to book a table for the soft opening through their email. We kept expectations low since we didn't want to be disappointed but we were absolutely blown away.We ordered takoyaki, calamari, and a whole bunch of skewers including gyutan, chicken thighs, meatballs, pork belly, shiitake and the peppers. The smokiness of the skewers was spot on and far more authentic than we had anticipated. The thing about yakitori is that because it's cooked on an open flame, it is incredibly difficult to consistently make it delicious, so I can understand if some people didn't have the same experience.The service was wonderful, our waitress was very friendly and wanted to hear more about what we liked, what we didn't like etc. The person who brought the food struggled a bit to pronounce some of the dishes (totally understandable since the restaurant was new) but everything arrived warm and in a timely manner.I had a wonderful evening enjoying some beer and delish food with friends, can't wait to come back! Don't know why it's gotten so many negative reviews, I don't think it's warranted.",5,10/21/2021,Tori Jiro
564,Wow. What a unique menu. So many amazing flavors at one spot. The staff was also very accommodating and friendly!,5,10/26/2021,Tori Jiro
565,"My husband and I were looking for a place to eat when we noticed this place was open so we decided to try it. So glad we did. First off the staff were all wearing masks, so I appreciated their commitment to safety. We were seated right away at the bar, and the overall service was great. Everything we had was delicious - I feel like we tried most of the menu. We had the ramen, karaage, a bunch of different skewers, nori fries, and the shrimp pops. Everything was great and the staff were super friendly and helpful. Would for sure recommend this place to others and we're definitely coming back here.",5,10/27/2021,Tori Jiro
566,"Great spot for Japanese style street food! The drinks were also really good! The place was really busy... even on a Thursday for dinner. But we got seated quickly. The staff was friendly and you can tell they work really hard because they were going nonstop. I went with a group of 5 and we got a bunch of different dishes. We got 1-2 of each item to share. So, this is my list of what I liked the most to least. - Ika Skewer (crispy but still tender on the inside)- Pork Jowl (I liked it with the sauce but if you prefer less sweet, it also comes in salt and pepper seasoning)- Shrimp pop (crispy and tender on the inside) - Ika Karaage - Takoyaki- Hanger steak- Shishito peppers- Mushroom - Chicken thigh - Chicken kiraage - Pork belly- Miso ramen with the spice on the side (spice is super spicy! So you only need a little)- GyozaOverall, the food was really good and came out really quick. I'm more of a seafood person so it makes sense as to why the seafood dishes were my most favorite. But, you really can't go wrong with any of the dishes! The ambience was also fun and the artwork is beautiful to see. Also, the prices were very reasonable. Definitely will be back!",5,10/28/2021,Tori Jiro
567,"Came here with a group of friends the other night and really enjoyed it! We ordered a bit of everything to share. Before getting to the food, one of the highlights of our dinner was, surprisingly, their sparkling water. Its called 5X water and the machine they use is from Japan, it is extremely carbonated and so refreshing! I also loved the Yuzu soda that they get from Japan.  I would probably go back here for that yuzu soda alone. The food was good and easy to share; I've never had this type of cuisine before. All the meat was very tender! My favorites were the pork jowl, pork belly and squid. I also loved the takoyaki! The miso ramen was pretty good too; if you order it spicy, I would order the spice on the side as a little goes a long way. Also enjoyed the overall ambience of the restaurant. Definitely a good place for a night out; would recommend trying!",5,10/29/2021,Tori Jiro
568,"Excellent yakitori, stellar customer service, and bad-ass restaurant decor! I feel so lucky that my friends and I accidentally found Tori Jiro during our trip in Boston. When I lived in Japan, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the insanely long menu at yakitori places, so I actually appreciated how Tori Jiro's menu was only a page long with various kinds of izakaya food. My absolute favorite were the tsukune, pork belly, gyutan, and chicken breast--so smokey, scrumptious, and just so perfect! Also loved the nori fries, which were like the Japanese snack Jyagariko but ten times tastier, and the Japanese kyoho grape soda. Btw I learned that you can also ask for yakitori with salt instead of the sweet sauce, even though it wasn't on the menu. The salt yakitoris were incredible as well. Definitely coming back during my next trip to Boston!",5,10/29/2021,Tori Jiro
569,"The best ramen I have ever eaten. I got the ike skewers to try something new, and they were amazing.  There are so many choices that I know I'll be back again soon. I'll get the $110 sake sometime in my life.",5,11/6/2021,Tori Jiro
570,"Tori Jiro is a Japanese based chain from Japan with multiple oversea locations. The brand new location at Arsenal Yard in Watertown, MA will be its first US location. Arsenal Yard also offer plenty of dining, shopping, and entertainment venues. There is plenty of garage parking. Tori Jiro is a great addition. The restaurant is known for its yakitori but I suggest you try everything on the menu. My family went on a Tuesday night right at opening at 6PM. We were immediately greeted and seated. The restaurant quickly filled up after our drink orders were taken. Our waiter promptly took our food order after bringing our drinks order. I had the Tokyo Tea while my husband ordered a Sapporo. Their drink selection is larger than their food menu. My husband and I were given Zuzu sake to try, and wow, I recommend this over the cocktail that I ordered. For yakitori, I went straight down the menu and ordered everything on the yakitori menu and the meats menu. We ordered the chicken thigh, chicken breast with cheese, chicken breast with yuzu pepper, tsukune (chicken meatball) with egg dipping sauce, pork belly, pork jowl, gyu tan (beef tongue), lamb chop, and gyu sagari (hanger steak). I enjoyed all of the skewers however I would suggest the chicken breast with yuzu pepper over the cheese option. I think it is good to try the cheese option at least once though. As for the pork, I would ordering the pork jowl over the pork belly. I wish Tori Jiro had Kawa (chicken skin) and other organ meats but they are still in the soft opening stage so I am hoping the menu will continue to expand. We also ordered the Nori fries, takoyaki, ika skewers from the hot appetizer menu. We ordered the takowasa from the cold appetizer menu and the curry rice with chicken karage from the Donburi menu. The Nori fries were a tad salty and a bit limp. The takoyaki was delicious and the kids really enjoyed it. There was plenty of octopus in them. I recommend the ika skewers which were lightly battered and crispy. The children approved of them. The takowasa for those who enjoy this dish was very fresh. For those who don't know what this is, it is not for everyone. It's chopped raw octopus with wasabi. Because it is raw, it retains the slimy texture and the wasabi also gives it a kick. Not recommended to the non adventurous.  Lastly, the curry rice with chicken karage was delicious but the rice was a tad bit mushy. The chicken karage was lightly battered and juicy. The curry (Japanese curry) was on point. Overall, if this was a soft opening, then 5 stars! The service we received was excellent throughout. Our waiter was extremely efficient. The interior and atmosphere was lively and aesthetically pleasing. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back to explore the ramen and drink selection in my next visit. See my pictures.",5,11/9/2021,Tori Jiro
571,"It's not everyday that you find a cool yakitori spot in the US - especially in this area of Boston - so I was super excited when I saw Tori Jiro open a few months ago. I've been meaning to stop by since then, but apparently they're actually still in a 'soft opening' phase (according to their website), and their hours are quite limited at the moment, so it was a lucky moment when my schedule finally worked out for a weekday dinner with two of my friends.The interior looks amazing - clearly newly renovated (or built?), with a very chic/modern aesthetic - and when we arrived, all of the tables along the walls were busy. The three of us got seated at a large table, and we were joined later by another group of 4 at the other end - but it's definitely large enough that this didn't really bother us.We ordered a bunch of skewers down the menu - (would recommend this strategy - just to get a taste first before deciding which to order more of!). To be honest, nothing we ordered was short of delicious, but particularly memorable were the hanger steak - expertly cooked to melt-in-your mouth - the chicken meatballs, and the pork belly.We also had the chicken karaage which was also amazing - nicely fried without being too heavy, and the meat was so tender and juicy that we ended up ordering 2 plates! The accompanying mixed greens salad was also so delicious that it's worth a mention - fresh veggies with a perfect amount of a sweet dressing that just perfectly complemented the heavier, more savoury tastes of the meats.Gyoza was nice, too, but for the portion size and price I'm not sure if it was necessarily worth it, especially with so many other fantastic choices.My sole complaint was just that the service was quite slow and our servers were not the most attentive - it took ages for us to order, to get our food, to ask for the cheque, etc. That being said, all in all, everything was extremely delicious and inexpensive; and, even though their menu isn't the largest, there's definitely so many great choices, from skewers, shared plates, or even ramen (which I'll have to try next time!). I'm already planning my next visit :P",5,11/11/2021,Tori Jiro
572,"Came here after seeing a movie at Majestic. Service was very quick! The food came in at different times which was great and not overwhelming. The chicken thigh yakatori was great, very tender and came with great sauce. The pop shrimp was AMAZING! Overall, great experience!",5,11/25/2021,Tori Jiro
573,"We were so excited to have a yakitori place open in Boston but after going multiple times unfortunately we just don't love this place. When they first opened, the atmosphere and service were good and the food wasn't amazing but not bad either. However, after visiting multiple times, the service has gotten worse and most recently the dishes piled up on our table and the waiter never cleaned it. Another server was pouring beer and it spilled all over the place. Though we know they are doing their best it really ruined the overall experience. We also wish their yakitori selection was larger given they are a yakitori restaurant.",3,11/27/2021,Tori Jiro
574,"Who would imagine that there is such a good yakitori place in Watertown? Being from Japan, we had a pretty high bar for a yakitori place and we were pleasantly surprised by the experience at Tori Jiro.We came to the restaurant on Tuesday right after it opened. We were able to get a seat right away but the seats got full very quickly after that. I would recommend reserving even if it's on a weekday if you are coming at busy hours.What we ordered:Citrus Dream Martini $13Highball ""champagne"" with Toki whisky $9Chicken Thigh $3.5Tsukune (chicken meatball) $5King Oyster Mushroom $4Shishito $3Gyu tan (beef tongue) $8Gyu sagari (beef hanger steak) $5Gyoza $12Shio ramen with clear broth $13The waiter was very pleasant and knowledgeable. They willingly offered information on every menu we were considering before we asked without being pushy. This was very helpful. The cocktails we ordered were nothing like what we had before. I especially liked the Citrus Dream Martini and would gladly come back for this! You can immediately tell that the food quality is high. All yakitori and vegetables are cooked carefully in low heat and the texture is perfect. Their original sauce goes so well with them. Ramen was also really good, better than some (if not many) ramen shops in Boston, honestly.I only have two minor complaints. First is that the seat we got was right by the door and that it was cold. Second is that, because the food was so good, I wish there were more yakitori and veggie options on the menu. It is yet such a pleasant experience that we'd like to come back when we get another chance!",4,12/28/2021,Tori Jiro
575,Disappointing. I had really been looking forward to trying this place out but was pretty underwhelmed. The food was just OK. Not inedible but not notable. I've had far better ramen in Coolidge Corner that is a little cheaper. The bill ended up being $70 for two ramens and a handful of the yakatori skewers. For that price (or even for less money) you can have an outstanding dinner for two at Buttermilk & Bourbon just steps away. Service was good and our waitress was very nice but I can't say that I will be returning.,3,2/10/2022,Tori Jiro
576,"The most disgusting calamari I have ever had.They were so hard to chew that it was impossible to take a bite and the ones I did bite, I almost regurgitated them back into the plate.",1,2/12/2022,Tori Jiro
577,"Attentive service was a plus! (we sat at the bar). Watching them make drinks and grilling food is fun!  Had Sapporo which was wonderfully ice cold. Food yummy, but didn't care for the pork belly skewer.  Too tough.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the restaurant was advertised as this big thing coming to town/America even!  It's not that much of a stand out.  You can get bomb ramen a few miles up the road.  This is a great opportunity to 'try' lots of small dishes, sort of tapas style.",4,2/13/2022,Tori Jiro
578,"I came here on a Monday night with reservations and was seated as soon as I got there! They took my order and was nice enough to recommend a bunch of items that we ended up loving. It was my first time trying Tako Wasa and the spicy seaweed salad, let's just say I'll be back for more! Their skewers were cooked to perfection and we dipped it all in the egg yolk sauce! Not only were the foods good but their cocktails were good too! I got Yuzu, lavender, and lychee flavored ones that had alcohol but didn't have a strong alcohol taste.",5,2/16/2022,Tori Jiro
579,"I hate to say that I am spoiled, but I think i'm spoiled since I lived in NY for most of my life. The yakitori places in NY, especially around St. Marks really spoiled my taste buds. Tori Jiro is good but I believe there is room for improvements. One of our yakitori dishes were still cold in the middle (I assume they prep the skewers and refrigerate them). Friendly service and a nice addition to the Arsenal Yards complex. However, for the Boston area, i prefer to eat at Ittoku.",3,3/2/2022,Tori Jiro
580,"Tori Jiro is an amazing spot located in Arsenal Yards! I love that it is more of a lowkey spot to enjoy cocktails, skewers, and appetizers. Theyre still in the soft opening phase so I am excited to visit them again! Their cocktails were absolutely delicious and they have such a wide range of offerings from beer, sake, whiskey, etc. the cocktails werent too sweet and beautiful! They also have bunch of meat and veggie options for yakitori to suit all your dietary needs. My favorites were the chicken thigh, pork jowl, and the king oyster mushroom! Everything had a nice char and smoky flavor with delicious savory sauce. I decided to get bunch of small plates/appetizers to try and I just want to say that the spicy wings and takoyaki were the highlights. The spicy wing had a spicy dry rub that was super flavorful and built up heat. The wings had a nice thin crispy exterior, the meat was juicy, and ive never had anything like it in the area! This would be AMAZING with beer. Takoyaki here is the best one Ive had in the Boston area. The takoyaki was perfectly cooked. It had a crispy exterior and a soft interior. I find that many places undercook the takoyaki so I was sooo pleasantly surprised with these! I also loved that it wasnt soaking in the mayo nor the takoyaki sauce so that the flavors were really balanced. There was also a generous amount of bonito flakes!",4,3/3/2022,Tori Jiro
581,Same ramen but different amount of Broth? Very unsatisfied for togo order. i am not sure if i could finish this ramen with this amount of Shoyu broth l.,1,3/11/2022,Tori Jiro
582,"Amazing food, we tried a ton of the appetizers and meat skewers, and ramen, everything was awesome. Takoyaki was the best I've tried!",5,3/22/2022,Tori Jiro
583,"Looks the part, but doesn't taste the part. Underdone gyoza, bland tare, glorified maruchan ramen. About as authentic Japanese food as taco bell is authentic Mexican.Cool vibe, nice staff, would get a beer here. Skip the food.",2,3/26/2022,Tori Jiro
584,"This is for Chef Sang Lee's popup that I attended a few weeks go. Brought my cousin here to celebrate his birthday and the entire experience was worth the $240 price tag. I've had omakase in the past, but watching Chef Sang Lee up close was quite interesting, you can see the focus in his eyes and attention to detail. There's about 20 items, but I'll highlight the ones I really enjoyed! The saltiness from the caviar added and paired well with the squid; quite addicting and wish there was a bigger portion. Monkfish liver, which had the texture of tofu and had such an addicting sauce, that I pretty much drank it all. The egg omelet was sweet and you can see/taste the juiciness with every bite! My No. 1 favorite was the veggie roll with rainbow sesame on it. I thought it would be just one flavor in different colors, but it was a burst of several flavors!! All the items prepared tasted amazing, and I really like how he brushed some soy sauce on the rolls and had wasabi rolled in. This way, I never had the urge to drown my rolls as I would at regular sushi restaurants.The sake outside of the event were additional purchases. Up until I tried the iichiko, all sake tasted the same for the most part, but iichiko had a more define taste to it. I'm told sake masters worked hard to produce the brand. Kenny was the restaurant's host and also attended the event, super helpful and was able to balance enjoying the Chef's omakase as well as helping guests. He also played a country song for me (inside a Japanese restaurant ftw!). My party couldn't stop raving about this experience the entire way home! I highly recommend you try to attend a popup, otherwise, visit his take out in Gloucester.",5,3/28/2022,Tori Jiro
585,"Planning to go to Kura but the wait was crazy, ended up coming here as a backup plan since there was no wait. By the time we finished dinner at 6:30, people were waiting inside and outside the restuarant.  The drinks were great. The yakitori for the thigh and meatballs had too much sauce which makes it too salty. Shitake was over-seasoning. Pork jowl and pork belly are juicy, but the salt was unevenly sprinkled. My favorite is the ika skewers, which are crispy and the squid is still soft in the inside. Also the mont blanc in black sesame flavor. It is not too sweet and light with a strong black sesame flavor. It is a nice place to hang out and for a small eater.",4,4/1/2022,Tori Jiro
586,"I have been here a few times and really enjoy the great food, service, and atmosphere.  I suggest getting a ramen or curry bowl along with a range of skewers and fried foods.  This will give you different tastes and textures while filling you up as well. Two dishes that I really like are the raw octopus and egg soy sauce with the chicken meatballs. There are a number of cool cocktails and a large list of sake.  All the staff are great and watching the grill is a lot of fun.",5,4/8/2022,Tori Jiro

588,"Decided to come here spontaneously on a Wednesday evening and made a reservation for two for 6:30pm. All the tables by the wall were taken, but we were given a high-top by the window. The restaurant never completely filled up, and we noticed two different parties come in, sit down, then leave without ordering.We got the Kikori Kitty and LeCHe High cocktails, which were tasty. They accidentally made my LeCHe High into a martini, which I didn't mind. For food, we got two Chicken Breasts with yuzu pepper, four Gyu Sagari, Takoyaki, and Curry Rice. Split between the two of us, we were definitely full.The meal ended up being a little more expensive than I'd expect but the food and drinks were delicious. I would definitely come back again to try more of the menu.",5,4/14/2022,Tori Jiro
589,"Service, drinks, and small plates were yummy!  I'd skip the ramen and donburi.  Charshu chicken and egg were cold and broth was lukewarm as well as the curry. This is a great place to grab a drink and snack.  I'll be going back to try other items and cocktails.",4,4/15/2022,Tori Jiro
590,My wife and I had good experience. My wife really enjoyed her ramen and I like the curry rice. The service was bit slow. Took while to get our drinks and food .,4,4/16/2022,Tori Jiro
591,"The food was excellent. I would have given them five stars if it hadn't been for the service. Delicious ramen, with different broths you could choose from. Definitely get an egg in your ramen (or more than one). Also order the scallops. Best scallops I've ever had. Exceptionally fresh. Re service: There was a manager looking guy that wasn't super nice regarding a trainee and seemed to be giving preferential treatment to some tables, according to my boyfriend.",4,4/17/2022,Tori Jiro
592,"So so delicious. We have loved almost everything we've tried (and that's almost everything). The steak, chicken meatballs, and lamb chops are so tasty!",5,4/24/2022,Tori Jiro
593,"If you are coming here for the Yakitori and other Japanese dishes then this place isn't too bad. Unfortunately we weren't huge fans of the chicken broth-based ramen here.Parking is pretty abundant so worry not about driving here!Items we ordered as of 4/2022.- Pork Belly Yakitori - $4.5 each - This was great.  Loved the char flavor from the grill!- Gyu Sagari - $5 each - The beef wasn't too bad. Wasn't impressed with the sauce however. - Fried Oysters ( KAKI ) - $12 - If you're an oyster lover then get this!  Perfectly fried and went really well with the mayo and lemon.- Shoyu ( soy flavor ) clear base Ramen - $13 - Okay so this was our first time trying a chicken based ramen.... and it was kinda meh.  My brain just snapped to ""chicken noodle soup"" and I couldn't shake that taste.  The noodles themselves were perfectly cooked so no complaints there and it did taste a lot healthier than your typical pork based ramen. I just felt like something was missing.  Also their ""chicken char-siu"" was essentially sliced chicken breast. Definitely not my favorite ramen.  Overall I think we would have had a much better experience had we skipped the Ramen and focused on the Yakitori and other Japanese dishes.  We may give it another try next time but I would definitely give the ramen a pass.",3,4/30/2022,Tori Jiro
594,"Cozy, modern food joint with amazing Japanese food. ""Meat on a stick"" seems so basic but the staff at Tori Jiro make it pop. The food and drinks were amazing and the staff was super friendly.

595,"Went to Tori for the first time with friends. Upon entering, the host was very pleasant and seated us even though we did not have reservations. The inside of the restaurant had a great ambiance and  was beautifully decorated. I had high hopes for the food but was a bit disappointed. We got a variety of items including: Pork belly Pork jowlTsukune with egg told and tare dip Taki WasaIma skewersChicken thigh and breast skewers (non pictured)The food was a bit salty for the most part. There was nothing special in taste and the price was a bit high. I was also not very full by the end of the meal although I spent a good amount.",3,5/30/2022,Tori Jiro
596,"Looks amazing from the outside and I'm sure there are some issues with staffing and training and getting into the groove of things with the recent opening, however the service is extremely slow. Tables being cleared, being seated, being given a menu/water all takes longer than it should. On multiple occasions we were given a different tables drinks/food and when our food came it went to the table next to us. Overall disappointed.",1,6/4/2022,Tori Jiro
597,"We ended up here because we couldn't wait for the Kura Revolving sushi place to seat us, but we're glad we did. Beautiful interior with dramatic high ceilings and dark walls. The food is excellent, and our server was really nice. We had the yakitori, shrimp pops, shiitake mushrooms and ramen- the first two were fantastic, the second two items were good but lacked a punch. I liked that the ramen only uses chicken broth since we don't eat pork. They had run out of karaage chicken (disappointed!) but just means I have to come here again! They also comped us with mochi because another server mistakenly gave our order to another table.",5,6/13/2022,Tori Jiro
598,"Nice ambience. Seated quickly and service was good. We ordered the shoyu ramen with chicken char su. The noodles had a nice mouth-feel and the broth was light but still tasty and flavorful. It was the chicken that was lacking in flavor for me, quite bland. Everything else that we ordered, the ika skewers, takoyaki, and pork belly yakitori were yummy as well. Solid meal.",4,6/26/2022,Tori Jiro

Also the food and drinks was absolutely delicious. There wasn't anything that I didn't enjoy.The decor was really nice and made it so my friends and I had a very nice and memorable time.There was also a proposal happening and the staff did a really good job in notifying all the parties in the restaurant and helping with the proposal. Definitely recommend going.",5,7/11/2022,Tori Jiro
601,"Walked in on a Sunday night around 8pm and was seated immediately. The service was awesome, but the prices are too high for what you get. There are a lot of Japanese alcoholic beverages options which we enjoyed. I liked some of the items on the menu but not all.Items I liked:Okra - loved the sauce and the texture of the okra (how it was cooked)Cucumbers- the chunks were cut very big but despite that the sauce on the cucumber was really good. Yuzu sake - Loveeee tasted really good Gyu sagari- rich in flavor and super tastyPork belly- reminded me the of the pork belly skewers from a izakaya in japan and it did not disappoint! The items that were disappointing: Shoyu ramen (rich flavor) - the flavor didn't seem rich and the consistency of the broth I was not a fan of. Very mediocre wouldn't get again. Chicken breast yuzu skewer- not a fan, just dry chicken breast on a stick with a tiny bit of yuzu sauce Shishito peppers- just regular shishito peppers on a stick, nothing special but no complaints just nothing unique about it.",3,7/18/2022,Tori Jiro
602,"Came here on a scorching Sunday for a late lunch, friendly and attentive staff, reasonable priced dishes and very clean environment; it was a great dining experience. Some of the dishes are on the salty end but freshly made. The only downfall for me is that it's very family friendly and a changing table wasn't installed but great for hangouts.",4,7/24/2022,Tori Jiro
603,"Helpful tip: portion size of the skewers are small, the pork belly ones had 3 solid pieces each.Review: come here if you're more into eating small things and drinking. I like the vibez of the restaurant but I feel like the food is overpriced for the amount you get. The skewers taste decent and I think that the ramen is meh. There is definitely better ramen places else where. I spent like around $150 for 6 people and I feel like we were all still hungry afterwards.",3,7/27/2022,Tori Jiro
604,"We tried a big selection of skewers which were all solid quality. We also got a raw egg dipping sauce for the skewers which was verrry good. However, other than the chicken thigh, they weren't mind-blowing for the price that you pay, so I would personally stick with the appetizers and cocktails. Cocktails are reasonably priced compared to Boston/Cambridge. The lechetini had a delicious lychee film on it and lychee popping boba on the bottom, and the yuzu-ito had a very prominent yuzu flavor in it.The star of the meal was the karaage chicken and fried oysters for it. Suuuper juicy and huge pieces for $9. The fried oysters weren't heavy at all, and the sweet mayo sauce on top the oysters complemented them well. Takoyaki was decent but nothing crazy.",4,8/5/2022,Tori Jiro
605,"Fine cuisine without breaking the bank! Absolutely love the Gyu Sagari, 10/10 recommend, must try! The chicken karaage in the curry rice is also a  The service quality also adds to the fine cuisine experience",5,8/16/2022,Tori Jiro
606,Great yakitori.  Loved having outdoor seating option with COVID.  Nice presentation.  Ramen is quite good but not exceptional.,4,8/19/2022,Tori Jiro
607,"Been looking forward to try this place for months, but the experience was underwhelming. The main issue is the food quality, the service was actually really great.Tried the Shoyu Ramen and not only was the meat like cold turkey meat from school lunches, but the broth barely had flavor and there was a ton of diced raw onion in it. Yakitoris were okay, don't get the Yuzu Pepper Chicken one. The Ika Karaage was by far the best one. Drinks were just okay. For the price point, the food should be a lot better.",2,8/27/2022,Tori Jiro
608,"If you know your sake, this is probably the only place we've seen Dassai 23 offered on the menu with a wall of these bottles for any customer's consumption at will.While we've been here once, we came here a second time with our friends and ordered a slew of different sakes to share and they didn't disappoint in their flavor, complexity and smoothness.Although I wished we snapped some pictures, the food (quickly dug into and consumed) continued to be point, from the grilled skewers, which we had to ordered twice more, to the ramen and the raw octopus with wasabi.They have very attentive, professional and friendly service so stop on over for the sake and grilled skewers!",5,9/1/2022,Tori Jiro
609,"I'm not a big fan. The service is excellent Mia was a wonderful sever. The establishment itself is nice, the decor is beautiful. You have the option for outside seating. The food on the other hand. There aren't many options and for me the options they had didn't seem appetizing. I ended up getting the wings, which when I got them I had to recheck the menu make sure they weren't frog legs cause they were so small and weird looking. The taste of them were cool, the curry wasn't bad either.",2,9/3/2022,Tori Jiro
610,The best restaurant in Cambridge/Watertown/Waltham and all surrounding towns!!! Staff is amazing and the food is even better. The chicken meatballs are heavenly.,5,9/9/2022,Tori Jiro
611,"The food here was ok. Definitely come here if you are looking for drinks.  On the bright side, the service was great and the interior was really nice.",3,10/1/2022,Tori Jiro
612,"I decided to have a solo lunch. Brought a book into Tori, and sat at the bar. The waitstaff was so friendly and attentive. The miso ramen was rich and comforting. The Addicting Cucumbers have the perfect name, as I got a second order to go! I'm pumped to have this location just ten minutes from me.",5,10/10/2022,Tori Jiro
613,Delicious! Food was fantastic and plated beautifully! The staff was so friendly! The vibe is beautiful and the drinks were delicious! The only thing I wish they could change was the seating. The tables were so close together that my husband almost smacked the couple sitting next to us while he was talking (he talks with his hands lol).,4,10/22/2022,Tori Jiro
614,"Amazing spot :) the service was fast and attentive & the food was delicious! We had a few appetizers (yakitori pork, meatballs, and mushroom) , shoyu ramen and curry. Forgot to take pictures of the ramen but was good size portion with perfectly cooked noodles and flavorful broth. Will definitely be back and hoping to try something from the expansive sake menu.",5,10/23/2022,Tori Jiro
615,"There's legitimately no bad options on this menu. Great small yakitori restaurant with outstanding ramen, ambiance, and service. 10/10 recommend for anyone checking out Arsenal Yards. Great spot for a dinner date if you're looking to impress without breaking the bank.",5,10/23/2022,Tori Jiro
616,"This is a great place for drinks, small bites and if your in for a lighter meal. We went for dinner and ordered the yakitori sticks, shiyo ramen bowls and a few appetizers. The menu options are catered to small eats so its a place to go to if you want a lighter meal with drinks. The yakitori sticks were flavorful but a bit pricey. The only ramen options was chicken. The meat wasn't the best quality but overall the noodles had good texture with a nice soup base. I would recommend this place if your in the mood for a few small bites.",4,11/4/2022,Tori Jiro
617,"We went here for the first time after hearing good reviews about this place. While the food itself was good, nothing we ordered was correct. We asked for 1 chicken wing and 2 meatball skewers and received 2 chicken wings and no meatballs. We then ordered 2 shoyu ramens with rich broth and 1 shio ramen with clear broth. We ended up receiving 3 shio ramens with clear broth, and none of them had an egg as stated in the menu. When bringing this up to our waitress, she stated that she verbally confirmed with us that we wanted 3 shio ramens. If this is the case and we misheard, I don't understand what she must have been writing down while taking our orders to think we wanted 3 of the same ramen when we clearly had different orders. Furthermore, she told us that the egg was missing because they were out of eggs, and the price would be reduced to reflect that. The way she spoke was as though we were in the wrong, and she had no responsibility in it. We had accepted this, only for the manager to later come to us and ask us what the issue was. Upon explaining the egg situation, the manager appeared surprised and proceeded to tell us they DID have eggs in the kitchen. This means that our waitress completely lied to us about the situation, though it doesn't make sense why she couldn't just go back to the kitchen to get the missing egg rather than fabricate this lie. Overall, while we would like to return for the food, the extremely poor service and dishonestly has deterred us from coming back.",1,11/6/2022,Tori Jiro
618,"Had a reservation for three on a Friday night, waited 10 minutes to be seated. Food was tasty, fast, but a little salty. The waiter forgot to take our takoyaki order down but was super nice about it and said it was on the house since he didn't put it into the system. Good service and good food. Definitely recommend the ika skewers and the beef tartare.",4,11/11/2022,Tori Jiro
619,"This place is amazing!  Friendly staff, food is unbelievably fresh, restaurant is spotless!!  Prices and service are top notch!!  Much better than the chain Brazilian steak houses, highly recommended!",5,2/26/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
620,"Hands down recommend this restaurant! We went with a large party of 9 including kids and the service was prompt, attentive without being too obtrusive. The cuts of meat were seasoned well and the temp requested was served accordingly. The picanha was one of my favorite cuts as well as the classic filet mignon. It was difficult not filling up on the salad bar, cheesy bread, and Parmesan polenta but we did save some room! Also there was plenty of easy off street parking and valet service was offered as well. Do yourself a favor and try it!",5,2/28/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
621,"Great food, location, and staff! I enjoyed the beef ribs, lamb ribs, and filet mignon the most. Have to love the unlimited amount of cheesy brand and polenta. They were very accommodating as we had kids in our party and also a food allergy. The salad bar had a variety of foods. I usually eat a lot of the mushrooms but I thought they were a bit too salty. I liked the peppers and smoked salmon. For dessert we tried the papaya ice cream. It didn't look fancy but it was really good. Went well with a black cup of delicous coffee. Street parking was easy for lunch. Will be back again.",5,2/28/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
622,"Overall the entire experience was good. Positives, most of the meat was cooked nicely and very well seasoned. The leg of lamb was hands down me and my friends favorite. Service from the waiters, back staff and management was extremely attentive, kind and professional. 5 stars for the service. The selections from the cold bar and sides they brought to the table were decent.    Negatives, some of the gauchos were not as attentive as the waitstaff. There were guys with meat that passed right by our table multiple times when I had my coaster flipped to green. As a result I didn't receive the rack of lamb and I think a couple other items. But received seconds on items I wasn't really wowed by, which were also obviously the cheaper cuts. I also never saw classic filet mignon even though it was mentioned in previous reviews. They did bring by bacon wrapped filet mignon but it was medium well. Which I don't really blame them too much for. In order to get the bacon properly rendered and cooked through on a smaller piece of steak its tricky not to have the meat overdone. And I've had bacon wrapped filet at other Brazilian steakhouses and it was also always overcooked.   I've never been to the fogo de chao in Boston but went to the one in Orlando and I have to say I preferred it to this place. The meats and quality of were pretty close, however the cold bar was like twice the size at fogo and I received all the variety of meats at fogo including nice big portions of medium rare filet mignon.    Still 4 stars though because this place I believe just opened and I never like giving negative reviews to new restaurants because it always takes time to work out the kinks. And as I mentioned overall the experience was positive and well worth the $50.",4,3/1/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
623,I'm Portuguese and have family in Brazil. Been to rodizio type places my whole life. This place was awesome! Meat was great and they kept bringing the good cuts not like some other places that only send over mostly the lower quality stuff. Loved it! Gotta go. And owner met us and he was awesome!,5,3/7/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
624,"The food was delicious, the owners greeted us and offered custom lamb chops, and the service was phenomenal. I highly recommend Alma Gaucha over other Brazilian restaurants. A+",5,3/7/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
625,"This place is new. The staff is so welcoming, great, and super attentive.The salad bar is smaller than I thought but good. The caphirana selection is huge and very good. They had a good variety of meat and they were all pretty good. We had the chocolate molten for dessert and it was absolutely delicious. I think when we went it had just opened so the staff would come up to us with meat even though the sign was red but I am sure they figure it out now.Would definitely go back",4,3/8/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
626,"My daughter and I were staying at the Aloft Hotel for a Volleyball Tournament and we decided to go with another mom and daughter to eat an early dinner.  It was our first experience with a Brazilian Steakhouse and it was an excellent one! The service was excellent, the food was incredible from the chicken to the filet, it was just mouth wastering delicious. The waiters just kept filling out plate with food we were stuffed!  The wine choices were also excellent. This restaurant was well worth the cost, it was a fun experience with friends. Highly recommend. I look forward to going back next time we are in Boston.",5,3/9/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
627,Very nice place and people. As in most good Brazilian restaurants they keep coming around with skewers of different types of meat and you eat until you tell them to stop. The area with side dishes was filled with fresh Brazilian dishes and I would highly recommend this place.,5,3/13/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
628,"Food is just fine. They don't have many options. I Liked the deserts. The service is very good. But I think is very expensive, considering the variety of food. $50 dólars for person. Crazy.",3,3/15/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
629,I decided to treat myself to a steak for lunch today. Sadly I chose to order one from Alma Gaucha. What was supposed to be a nice rare picanha was an overcooked hockey puck with absolutely no flavor. What a complete waste of money and calories.,1,6/1/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
630,"As a Brazilian, I hold very high standards for Brazilian cuisine. This place far exceeded expectations! The meats were incredible, the fraldinha and the alcatra was my top favorites - both extremely tender and savory. I asked if they could make a passion fruit martini that wasn't on the menu - the bartender not only made it happen, but it was by far the best one I've had in the US. Not too sweet, and not too tart - just perfection. Lastly, the service and staff was exceptional -- very friendly and welcoming. Easily the best Brazilian restaurant I've eaten at! Highly recommend.",5,6/14/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
631,"Visited post-COVID reopening (June '20), so the patio was open but unfortunately not the nicely renovated interior. Given the challenging times for restaurants, and coming off a horrible experience at a different establishment the night prior, I was braced for a rough time, and was pleasantly surprised by a fantastic experience.Service first - the staff were uniformly polite, professional and attentive. The owner dropped by at one point and truly wanted to know how our night was going. Despite the difficulty of limited capacity, having to wear masks, etc., the staff still made the night feel like a high end dining experience.The food was good to great all around. The crab cake appetizer was a little on the soft side, but delicious. The only hiccup was that the asparagus side, which was presented chilled and a bit undercooked. Though not awful, it felt at odds with the rest of the menu. But every other side dish was lovely, including perfectly cooked glazed bananas and buttery mashed potatoes. For the main experience, every meat was flavorful, tender and well seasoned - the lamb was especially excellent, but it's all worth trying. Your greatest challenge here will be leaving any room for dessert. For that, we enjoyed the creme brûlée and passionfruit cheesecake - both tasty, although the creme brûlée was the star.All around a great night despite the difficult environment for restaurants - I'm looking forward to going back when the interior is open.",5,6/14/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
632,Pristine service and excellent food. We are so excited that Alma Gaucha is open again! Looking forward to supporting this wonderful establishment.,5,7/3/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha

634,Food was amazing and the hostess was so attentive and kind. Went to lunch with my family and felt very well taken care of. Everything we tried was delicious!,5,7/6/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
635,Everything is perfect the best churrascaria in EUA .Amazing food and service .The best carajillo as after dinner drink,5,7/31/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
636,Had a great night out and only great things to say about this new addition to the seaport.  The top management from Fogo de Chao opened this establishment and their skills are more than evident.  The restaurant is beautiful even with the COVID-19 spacing.  We ate outside and it was perfect.  Everything was ultra clean and we were still able to enjoy the experience of a Brazilian steakhouse.  We went inside and selected everything we wanted from the salad buffet and it was delivered to our table.  The meats were brought to the table and they were all hot and amazing.  Much better food than Fogo and the service and management were impeccable!  I can't say enough about this place and we will definitely be back soon.  Right across from The Lawn on D and plenty of on street metered parking that ends at 8:00 pm.  Give this place a try and you won't be sorry.,5,8/6/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
637,"As a native Brazilian I can say that this place is hands down the best brazilian steakhouse in Boston and probably the whole New England. Location, food, drinks and service are absolutely top notch!!! We'll definitely come back!",5,8/8/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
638,"Best Brazilian steakhouse I've been to in the U.S. food was amazing, service was great, and restaurant looks great. Will be back for sure.",5,8/8/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
639,"I came over with friends last night. Service was excellent!!! Our server, Maycon, was super attentive! Ana was amazing too. Great food, great drinks, great service, very clean and good vibes all around. Nothing negative to say. It was a good experience and I look forward to coming back again soon!",5,8/13/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
640,"Had an extremely enjoyable meal during Dine Out Boston. Even though we weren't able to enjoy the buffet like before the pandemic, we didn't feel jipped of the Brazilian Steakhouse experience at all! Mike, our server, was excellent. The food was delicious as well! Hot and fresh meats cut right in front of us. Kudos to opening such a well-run restaurant during COVID!",5,8/29/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
641,"Ever go in for Restaurant Week specials, but then you just saw so much meet, you opted for the full experience instead? Yeah, I kept the card on green until my plate was full! I was going to keep a list of the different type of meat that arrived, but I eventually lost track while chewing nonstop. I believe the ribs were my favorite, it was cooked just right and the level of saltines...mmh, that was heaven! My friend also enjoyed her drinks, stating they were quite strong. I ordered the same, but didn't feel as such. Dessert didn't interest me much, mostly things I didn't like, so I settled to sharing the Turtle Molten Cake. Also, dessert is an additional charge. I wouldn't come here too often because of the prices, but it's a nice place to come for a celebration!Covid Observation: tables definitely not 6 feet apart and staff wore masks",4,9/1/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
642,Pretty good overall. I would say it is on par with Fogo de chao but some of the meats can be overdone or too salty here. The cheese bread and service at Fogo is also a little bit better. They advertise prime grade meat but some of the cuts I tasted were tough and went straight to the napkin. I would stick mainly with the fillet and picanha.,4,9/2/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
643,"What a place!!!! Everything at this restaurant is amazing, went on a Sunday to have lunch with my husband and couldn't be more happier with the experience.The food is absolutely delicious, so many options and everything freshly made! Caipirinha was also delicious! The service was GREAT!!!! If i can give 10 stars I would.Definitely recommend",5,9/6/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
644,"My wife and I were regular customers at Fogo De Chao. But this new Gaucha place is better! In pretty much every way! The manager at alma gaucha used to be the manager at fogo for almost 20 years. So the guy definitely know what he is doing! I think this new place will be our Brazilian bbq goto place going forward. Btw, the parking is way easier here compared to fogo at back bay.",5,9/8/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
645,"So see the Brazilian bartender,  I didn't catch his name.  Highly skilled and really knowledgeable! We had a blast",4,9/9/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
646,"What a great experience! For a business that is a buffet they do an AMAZING job giving you that full service during a time where it can be a challenge. The meat came out hot and fresh and delicious and fast! The manager and wait staff were all very helpful and knowledgeable and clean. Everyone wore masks if you are worried.The experience started with filling out the checklist from both the hot sides and salad bar and were brought over on small trays and you could always get more! We tried almost everything but my favorites were the apple salad and the polenta. The meat was perfectly seasoned and some of our favorite meats where filet mignon, picanha, and chicken hearts. The table did get pretty crowded but the sides were there if you wanted them which was nice. NOW let me tell you about this caipirinha I had. It was one the best mixed drinks I have EVER had. I would come back here and just get 10 of these if I could! It was that good. Only thing is... keep in mind that Brazilian steakhouses are expensive and be willing to spend a good amount on dinner! Lunch is a little bit better priced! I just want to say overall great experience and service and so happy with how the night was during such an odd time.",5,9/16/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
647,"It was alright. The food was medicore but I would go back for the drinks. The passion fruit/lime caipirinhas was phenomenal (I got 2). The steak was overcooked and salty. We also got some items from the salad bar which was also mediocre. The arugula looked wilted & sad, the prosciutto was dry & looked old. But the Brazilian cheese bread and the polenta fries were so good!! If I was coming back here I would get the drinks, Brazilian bread & end it with the molten chocolate cake.",3,9/26/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
648,We ordered takeout dessert for my birthday since it's right beneath our hotel. They told us 10 minutes on the phone...fast forward to an HOUR later. Still no dessert. We had to remind the bartender and she came out with it. I assume it had just been sitting around while we waited. They basically forgot they'd told us to wait for it at the bar then tried to blame us for not getting it. The molten chocolate cake wasn't even molten. It was cold and hard. Then they presented us with one bill--we assumed they'd comped things due to the egregious service--only for them to run one of our cards for 4x the amount we thought! Without running it by us first. At a place of this caliber you'd expect much much better.,1,10/17/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha

651,"If I could give 10 stars, I would! My husband and I have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before and this did not disappoint. From the moment we walked in, the hostesses were so nice and friendly, and when we got the table they took off our coats for us and pulled out our seats. Every single waiter/waitress made you feel like you were the only customer there and the experience was like no other. We were laughing the entire time because we were having so much. You are able to try out so many fine, quality, meats for one price, instead of going to a traditional restaurant and paying full price for something you might not like.The food was DELISH. My husband loves meat (esp steak), so for him this was a dream come true. They have so many different meats of really high quality. They are constantly coming around with new things to try but don't make you feel pressured to try anything! We felt so well taken care of and left with full and happy bellies. We will certainly be back!",5,11/14/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
652,"New Brazilian steakhouse on the block and was satisfied with their food and service. I would've gave a 5 stars if the waitress that was taking care of us would come by and check on us once in awhile, being that it was our very first time visiting. Other than that, food was delicious and very clean environment! Lastly the entrance!!!! I had trouble finding which door to use since they have numerous doors to the establishment.",4,11/28/2020,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
653,"If you looking for a place where you can have a fantastic food with amazing meat Alma Gaúcha is the place to go. The meats are fantastic and done just right and the buffet is loaded with a great variety of foods (because of COVID-19 they serve you the food from the buffet). It's a fixed price and are all-you-can-eat, patrons receive a red card and a green card at their table. If you put up the green card, the servers will know you are ready to eat, and the meat keeps coming, and if you put up the red card, they will stop bringing food.Delicious food!!! ... and the caipirinhas are fantastic. They make great ones with different flavors. The staff is fantastic. Excellent service. There is definitely something for everyone. I strongly recommend it.",5,1/17/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
654,"To start the staff were very friendly ! except this one server we started with, wasn't a fan of him but liked the second server we had ! he was great. it was very busy  for a Sunday night. we chose not to do their dine out Boston menus because they didn't have the steak and beef included (which made no sense to me).  i wasn't really happy with the fact that I had to ask 3 different people for more fries. it's like they completely forgot about us. i waited maybe 20 minutes for Shirley temple. ridiculous . the people serving the meats were really nice and friendly. Anyway, the food was pretty good but a lot of the beefs and steaks were wayyy too salty! i only enjoyed the lamb, ribs, and chicken. their sides were okay. i liked the chicken salad, Caesar salad, garlic bread and fries. everything else wasn't great. I was disappointed because we filled out the paper for the sides we wanted in the beginning, our first server never came to get it,  when someone else finally realized that we never got our sides, we then got them. it seems like they didn't even look at our paper fully cause we were missing items we asked for !overall the food was pretty good. if you don't like super salty foods then this place might not be for you. i felt like the place was disorganized and we never really knew who our server was but the guy helping us toward the end was really sweet. i didn't like waiting 20 minutes for things i asked for but not a super bad place to come and eat with family or friends. i definitely won't be back",3,3/15/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
655,"Delicious food and drinks accompanied with friendly service that makes you feel at home! I love coming to Alma Gaucha to enjoy the various cuts of meat (filet mignon and the lamb leg are my favorite), the grilled cheese with honey (so good!!!) and the wine and cocktail options. Due to COVID, the buffet bar where you can normally grab bottomless side dishes is now served to you a la carte. As you want additional sides throughout your meal, you have to flag a waiter to ask. Luckily, the service is amazing and a waiter is always within reach to request more salads, vegetables, or cheesy bread. I highly recommend coming here if you like meat and are very hungry!",5,3/22/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
656,We came here for lunch. Service was so slow. The drinks were good and strong. When we finally got our sides we didn't get everything we ordered. They were small plates and not enough for the entire table. We felt like we were rationing it which isn't a feeling you should have at a buffet and especially when you are paying so much. When it finally ran out we asked for more and it never came. Neither did the items we ordered but never received. Eventually we did get them once we were done eating. The meats delivered were good but they didn't have the full selection of meats. No chicken items. They were nice enough to make some chicken specifically for me but it was so dry I could barely eat it. I feel bad because they tried and I think they were just very understaffed and couldn't keep up. Maybe only go at night when they are fully staffed and have all the food options.,2,3/24/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
657,"Very good service and great selections of Brazilian meat  for the price. With the pandemic, the only exceptions to the norm protocols is that, they bring the salad buffets to you. Nevertheless, I would say this isn't a set back in anyway, as Alma Gaucha still brings some very sections. Service by individual servers (meat cutters) are great.",5,3/28/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha

659,"New favorite Brazilian steakhouse, better than the other famous name. I believe that if majority of the guests in an international cuisine restaurant are from that original region, it's approved by the local ""experts"". The guests in the restaurant proves the authenticity. I absolutely love their top loin, filet mignon and chicken heart, and everyone's favorite grilled cheese (can't have enough of it). Their waiter and waitresses are all very friendly. Booking a table was easy.",5,4/24/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
660,Best Brazilian steakhouse in Boston by farrrrr! The drinks are amazing and the all the meats are prime and you get like 8 different types!!! The service is spectacular and very formal and the two managers are the nicest most welcoming hosts I've ever had  Great sense of Brazilian culture but also makes you feel like your home,5,4/26/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
661,Ordered the filet and ribeye. Possibly the worst steak I have ever had. Asked for it medium rare and got it well done. There was a large slice on the top of the filet where the cook checked to see if it was done. Asparagus tasted like some kind of fuel. Tasted like chemicals. The only thing that was good was the mashed potatoes. Won't be back,1,4/28/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
662,"I've had  both the all you can eat and the take out plates and the food does not disappoint.

I would go here every weekend if my metabolism could handle it.",5,5/3/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
663,"Amazing!!!!!  I am an American and my husband is Brazilian. We have checked out every Brazilian restaurant in Massachusetts. Alma Gaucha is phenomenal . Prime cuts of meat that are constantly circulating the floor, a top line salad bar and a delicious bar. Service was attentive and constant and friendly. The owner was circulating as well and I do not think we have met a nicer person. Overall A+ in everything.",5,5/14/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
664,"I think this place is much better than Fogo de Chao, mainly the meats aren't over salted.

665,"I've been going to Fogo for many years and felt like it has declined over time. Alma Gaucha is a much better version of Fogo, what that place used to be years ago. A bit expensive which is why I'm not giving 5 stars, but if you want Brazilian bbq in Boston, then Alma Gaucha is your best option.",4,6/2/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha

667,"I think this is the most underrated of the popular Brazilian steakhouses in town. The servers are friendly, the meat is seasoned and cooked well, the buffet is slightly smaller but made up in the quality of the food overall. Every piece of steak was super tender and juicy.

668,"This is a great spot. I love Brazilian steakhouses and have been to many. The service here is fantastic. The atmosphere is elegant and peaceful. This is a great spot for a casual lunch or fancy night out. The food is always fresh, the meat always tender and juicy. Even when it's slow, they aren't serving yesterday's leftovers. I highly recommend this restaurant and I'll come back every time I'm in town.",5,7/7/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
669,"Excellent food, perfect if you like protein-heavy meals. Besides all the meats, they have amazing maple bacon at the buffet, and I highly recommend the corn chowder. They also have amazing cold smoked salmon, fried polenta sticks, and soft, fluffy, cheesy bread rolls. The staff are very friendly and gracious. This would be a great outing for a large group of people with diverse tastes.",5,7/21/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
670,Fantastic spot for when your belly is empty. Service was incredible and cleanliness was great. Delicious food and such a hospitable staff. We'll be back!! Enjoy,5,8/9/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
671,"We came for dinner and truly had a lovely night! The salad buffet had delicious veggies and salads as well as shrimp, smoked salmon, and an assortment of cheeses. They also had clam chowder, which had nice big chunks of clam and great flavor! The meats were tender and well seasoned, my favorite was the lamb! When you go, you must try the grilled cheese with honey; I must have had three pieces just on my own.This restaurant had some of the most outstanding service we had ever experienced. One of the owners, Anna, regularly checked in on us to make sure we received a nice assortment of meats (she knew we did not eat pork so wanted to ensure we'd get a nice variety). We felt so welcomed and comfortable, and can't wait to visit again!",5,8/13/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
672,Amazing meat and drinks. Come hungry. Make sure to ask for any cuts you don't see they will come with them right away. Best service for a Brazilian bbq.,5,9/11/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
673,"Every time I leave here I say it's the best meal I've ever had! Not only is the food outstanding , but the staff is amazing. They really go above and beyond to make sure the service is excellent!!",5,10/10/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
674,"My family and I lost power on the South Shore after an October Nor'easter. After 3 days without power, we decided to get a hotel room @ Aloft. All of us hadn't eaten since breakfast and had no idea what food options the Aloft had. We went to AG on a whim, as it was the only real restaurant in the hotel. We didn't even know it was a Brazilian steakhouse until we sat down. All I can say is WOW. This may have been the 2nd best meal I've ever had in my life. The salad bar was just a starting point but everything was delicious! From the candied bacon to fresh hard Parmesan to black beans to delicious tomatoes. Then, these amazing side dishes show up -- popovers for the table and fried bananas and polenta - both spectacular. But the the MEAT arrived. What do you mean you don't eat no MEAT!  Wow. My favorite had to be the house special (prime rib). The server would actually cut a fresh outside piece for both my son and me, so we'd each get extra flavor and salt. The sirloin was also very good (until I tried the prime rib!) and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for. My wife and daughter both loved the salmon too. The service was impeccable and waiter was incredibly attentive. The desserts were also incredible - we had the crem brulet and chocolate cake. The only one tiny thing I would have to say negatively was the host didn't explain the ""system"" very well -- how you have to turn over your card to ""no""  to stop getting meat. So for a while we were almost bombarded with meat. But once we figured it out it was fine. We 100% will be back. Certainly not a cheap dinner, but if you're looking for everything you eat for 2+ hours to burst with flavor and be perfectly salted, this place is for you!",5,10/29/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
675,"- good lunch  great during the conference for lunch hour between classes  turnover can be fast or slow as you'd like- good meats- each meat was better than the last- great salad bar  I would go, just for that- the shrimp was good- the sangria had way too much ice- good service",4,11/2/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
676,"My first trip in Boston and celebrated my birthday here in Alma Gaucha. I tried many brazilian grill around LA and Las Vegas but I might say this is one of the best! The staff and crew were also welcoming, thumbs up when it comes to customer service. I'll definitely recommend and come back to this place.",5,11/8/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
677,"Back as promised...This place is a ""grazer's paradise"" and I'm a grazer. How have I not dined like this before?This place is packed on a Sunday...reservations needed.They helped me out by putting me at a discrete table; sitting by myself made me self conscious. lolI believe I had a bite everything they sent my way...barring the chicken hearts. I think that's what they were. Little nuggets on a skewer didn't look promising to me. Everything else was fantastic...tender and flavorful. I prefer meat on the rare side but if you prefer it a little more done...ask them and they'll come back around. At least in my experience.To balance the meat extravaganza, there's a buffet. I was curious how the buffet would play into the meal; it's loaded with light options as a balance.  Fresh fruit, lightly cooked vegetables, salad, some cheese options etc. There are also some rice options in the hot buffet section along with clam chowder.No, I didn't try the clam chowder because a review would be futile. People are touchy about their chowders; especially up there.Lastly; the grilled cheese...I thought it would be the grilled cheese I grew up with; nope its ""grilled"" cheese. It's served with honey so I tried bites with and without it.  A little dab of honey is the way to go.As for desserts, didn't try them. I'm not huge on desserts; you're on your own there.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx­xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxOk, I love this place but I can only it give it 3 stars since I only sat at the bar and missed out on the food experience that you go there for. Now, that being said, I'll be back there in a few days to complete the review. I've never eaten in a Brazilian Steakhouse and the ""meat sweats"" seems like a ""shared"" experience. Since I'll be by myself, I'll go it alone; for science.As an ""out of towner"", how did I get here? I was told to stay at the hotel it's connected to due to the proximity of the event I was attending. Looks like that played in my favor. Alama seems to be a place that you have to ""know about"" due to it's location; a destination. During my time at the bar, people know about it.The crowd was a mix of families, boys night, girls night, couples, birthdays, business travelers and large groups. The patrons took their time, enjoying the comfortable atmosphere, array of food options and wonderful service.Speaking of service, the staff is friendly; genuinely friendly. It's obvious they want you to enjoy your time there. I'm sure people have mentioned the wine and spirit options; the bar staff is well educated on both. Each of the drinks were hand muddled to order; no bulk prep here.What did I eat? -Stuffed Jalapeños wrapped in Bacon - so good, these weren't pulled from the freezer.-Alma Gaucha Mini Skewers (tenderloin) - presentation was fun and the portion was a good size. Perfect for someone that's not looking for the ""meat sweats"" but still wants a taste of what they have to offer.-Pao de Queijo - (hope I got that right) essentially a warm bite of cheesy goodness; and gluten free. You could easily fill up on these as they bring them to the table. -Picanha - got this to go with a side of mash potatoes and a salad. While this was very good, I wouldn't recommend take out unless you're gonna eat it right away. I had some more wine and hung out in my room before eating it; didn't quite get the experience of having it sliced fresh at the table.What did I drink?-Alma Margarita - perfect for fall. First time having a margarita with a cranberry base.-Cranberry Lime Caipirinha - (guess I was really in the mood for cranberries) These signature cocktails were light and fresh. For those watching your ""sugars,"" this drink does have quite a bit of it.  It's easy to dial it back though; just ask.-Wine - after having a discussion with the bartender he recommended two I should try. After a taste of each both were good options for what I was looking for.Like I said, I'll be back in Boston a few days from now and will indulge in the rest of the Alma Gaucha experience.",5,11/12/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
678,Great service and quality of steak. Drinks were amazing as well! Can't wait to go again.,5,11/13/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
679,"We could not have asked for a more perfect birthday dinner. From ambiance to customer service, they have it all. Everyone in the staff is so attentive which almost makes you feel like family. This was our first time of hopefully many! Thank you to all of you. Thiago, Andres, Sherry, Vinicius and many more. Keep being great and this place should easily keep its 5 stars!",5,12/28/2021,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
680,"It gives a very similar vibe to another Brazilian all you can eat buffet around the prudential area. The service is great and hospitable. We arrived and we only had to wait a minute before getting seated. There's a lot of stuff to choose from like fruits, salads, etc. but I was really there for the meat. To be honest, the meats taste great but I just don't like it when they are too dry. I think only a couple were and that was fine with me.",5,1/3/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
681,"Move over, Fogo de Chao. We've got a new Brazilian steakhouse KING in Boston!!This spot is located in a beautiful seaport location and I was charmed by this restaurant experience that ticked off all the boxes: delicious food, outstanding service, non-stop skewers of steak coming to your table, and a great ambiance.Food: The steaks are cooked very well, with a crispy exterior but juicy and flavorful meat. Many Brazilian steakhouses get this wrong and leave large chunks of white fat on the meat, but I always got a perfect Picanha with a crispy charred ring of fat around the steak. They also brought out a specialty board of beef ribs, which was absolutely fantastic and the most tender and succulent piece of beef ribs I've had in my life.Service: We had multiple waiters help with our table, constantly checking on our drinks, food, whisking our dirty plates away and exchanging them for fresh ones. And to our surprise, the OWNER himself, Anderson Winck, stopped by our table to chat with us. After I commented on how gorgeous his knives were, he surprised us by giving a set! Amazing that the owner would be on the front lines making sure his restaurant is in top order.If you want a wonderful steak dinner fit for an anniversary, celebration, or just plain good 'ol steak, come here!",5,2/6/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
682,"I loved it here, we had come here once before and everything was delicious so I decided to host my boyfriends bday dinner here, they were super accommodating and had no problem setting up a table for 18. They have the freshest salad bar area with lightly seasoned veggies, fruits, cheeses and a hot bar section with soups and rice and beans. They also have a candied bacon that's delicious. The meats came around at a good pace I didn't feel like we missed anything each one came around at least 3 times, everyone was raving about the meats and we had a great time",5,2/22/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
683,"Alma Gaucha has come highly recommended and I was excited to have the chance to try it and see how it stands up against Fogo De Chao.What we tried:drinks-passion fruit and lime caipirinhas: recommended by the server and they knocked it out of the park; delicious flavors, 10/10-tropical caipirinhas: preferred the passion fruit over this blend, 7/10appetizers-polenta fries: solid, similar to fogo de chao's, 7/10-cheese bread: delicious and pillowy, much prefer this to the Fogo De Chao version, 8/10-clam chowder: tasted liked canned chowder, which wasn't bad! just didn't feel house-made, 5/10grill-queijo (grilled cheese with a honey drizzle): nutty and a wonderful way to break up all the meat that was being served, 7/10filet mignon: best cut of the night, 8/10-bacon wrapped filet mignon: 7/10-ribeye: tender, but not as flavorful, 6/10-alcatra (top sirloin): oversalted, 4/10-parmesan pork: a bit on the dry side, parmesan seasoning felt out of place, 4/10dessert-creme brulee: solid, but had a thick layer of caramelized sugar; its sweetness took away from the custard, which was more creamy than custardy to me, 5/10-molten lava cake: well done! perfect consistency and the center of the lava cake stayed molten up until the last bite, 9/10What I found with the grilled meats was that what was served was not consistent in seasoning and level of doneness. Some meat would come out oversalted and undersalted. Most of the meat on the floor was cooked on the medium / well done side. I'm someone who prefers rarer cuts, and often times, the servers would apologize and say that the cuts on hand were medium or well done. But once I mentioned that I liked rarer cuts, certain servers would specifically come by and say that they finally have rarer cuts. What really helped was being vocal about what you want. If there is a certain cut of meat that hasn't come by your table, you can ask the server if they're able to bring it over in the next round. Alma Gaucha staff were very attentive and would always bring what the table wanted right after we spoke to them.Overall, Alma Gaucha was plentiful in food and drink, and there were definitely certain items that impressed me, but those definitely didn't include the grilled meat--I do wish they were more consistent with their preparation. If you're someone who wants to try all sorts of meat, this is the place you're looking forward. But if you're someone who wants their meat seasoned and cooked a certain way, you might want to venture over to a steakhouse like Grill 23.",3,2/24/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
684,"Why would anyone go to Fogo de Chao with this in town? Similar prices but better meat, and amazing sides (I tried to save my stomach for mostly meat, but even so couldn't resist having multiple cheese bread puffs and fried yucca sticks). Just wish they had some dessert options in the salad / unlimited sides bar.",4,2/26/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha

690,"We made a reservation for restaurant week and we we're under the impression that it is $41 per person with that promotion. However, the bill did not reflect that and we were charged the regular rate. We've gone last year during restaurant week and enjoyed the experience. However, I am really disappointed by the misinformation this time around.",3,3/20/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
691,"We got reservation last night and expect the dine out boston menu. When the waiter asked if it was our first time there, I said yes and he seemed didn't want to hand us the Dine Out menu until I asked another waiter. We decided getting full experience instead of Dine Out Menu but all we got was just sirloin meat (which is on the dine out menu). We haven't get any ""expensive meat"" - as they described until I asked "" So do we get the filet mignon and lamb chop or we have to order it separately?"" Good thing , we got filet mignon and ribeyes once of each. And bad thing that we haven't got any lamb chop at all for whole dinner  i feel like a scam when I paid for full experience but got the cheap meat and cheap service !!",2,3/22/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
692,"Where do I start, this place makes fogo seem basic. The service is outstanding, I enjoyed the full service and ordered a few drinks and I felt happier when I left.

693,We went to Alma for my dad's birthday celebration with a group of 20. The restaurant was very accommodating for our party size. The designated server for our party was extremely attentive. Loved that they were able to generate separate checks for each family without any issues. And the food quality was on point. They have maintained their quality standards since opening. Thank you Alma Gaúcha!,5,3/28/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
694,"The food at Alma Gaucha was fantastic, fresh and well prepared. We enjoyed the service and location. Unfortunately the bar was completely backed up, we had finished our meal before our drinks arrived. The manager on duty noticed and removed the drinks from our bill. They didn't need to do this, certainly a nice gesture!! Reconfiguring the bar to match the speed of the food service would be a reasonable improvement.We would return anytime!",5,4/17/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
695,I came here for just dessert and I was not disappointed!! The cheesecake was absolutely amazing and the portion was HUGE. It's a good idea to come here to split it with someone! This place is located in the Aloft hotel. It's not a huge restaurant but the staff was nice and helpful and the service was good. They have a lot of different drinks as well and crafted some pretty cool cocktails that was saw while we were dining! I recommend to check out this place if you want good food and an exciting experience.,5,5/3/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha

Stay away from the bacon wrapped jalapenos, they were awful.Drinks were excellent!! We sat outside with our dogs, most places in the area are not dog friendly so this earns them bonus points",4,6/10/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
698,"It was my first time here and the salad bar was so basic it barely had anything good to eat or special. It was just plain sides with caesar and soups. The salad did not even taste like caesar.... Lol. The options for main courses like beef, lamb, etc was limited. I think this was the worst Brazilian Steak house I have ever been to. On top of that, we brought our OWN CAKE. They CHARGED A CAKE FEE JUST TO CUT THE DAMN CAKE FOR US. We told the server we wanted to cut it ourselves but he said it was the house rule to cut the cake for us. This is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Why do you need to charge a damn cake fee when the customer can just cut it themselves. They charged me $3 per person!!!! They did not even tell me ahead of time that there was going to be a fee for the cake. That is ridiculous!!!!! Imagine having a bigger party??? Worst place ever!!!! Definitely would not recommend or ever come back again!!!",1,6/11/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
699,"Overall, my experience here was good. Friendly service and savory all you can eat Brazilian cuisine.Alma is located right across the street from Lawn on the D.  I came after the rest of my group was there and they paid for Valet service, but the parking spots were right in front of the restaurant so they didn't move the cars for us. This was a waste of money-- my group could have parked down the street for free since it wasn't that busy that day. Disclaimer, the valet service is from Aloft hotels not Alma. The servers here are friendly and attentive. They were constantly serving us food and the managers consistently checked up on us, took photos for us and gave us advice on traveling to Brazil.I thought the food was good, not great. If you've never been to this type of restaurant before, you serve yourself sides and they bring around meat every two minutes. The sides were okay, I had rice and black beans and cold broccoli. The meats are where it's at, I had lamb, chicken, pork and most of it was amazing. However, I didn't like the chicken bacon and couldn't finish it. The price not including drinks comes to $69 per person, which is on par considering it's in the Seaport district and the rising costs of everything.Not my favorite restaurant, but I'd come here again.",4,6/21/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
700,"First of all, we've been to a lot of Brazilian steakhouses. This one had by far the very best service from managers and bussers we've ever had. Our actual waiter seem to be very bossy and critical of all the people ""under him"" which was very off putting. However there were two managers and 3 drink ladies that were phenomenal. The hostesses we're having some sort of conflict when we arrived. The food: Pros: Brazilian lemonade and pao de queijo (cheese bread) were delicious and lived up to the hype. Cons: Meat and salad bar was just ok. Not what we're used to when eating at a Brazilian steakhouse.",4,6/23/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
701,"Everything, I mean everything, was perfect! From the buffet items, fresh fruit, wonderful salads, perfect rice and black beans, it was filled with items to delight any taste. The servers were wonderfully attentive, not to mention hot! They met our every need, including practically running to get us chimichurri, hot sauce and mint jelly. The meat! Oh my god. The meat was amazing! The sirloin and filet was the best we've ever had! And the lamb chop was so perfect! Then to top it all off, the plantain was like an amazing dessert! They were so friendly! We had a blast!",5,6/25/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
702,"Not the most appetizing pictures, but this place was absolutely delicious. It was my first time at a Brazilian Steak House and the staff explained how everything worked. There were managers and waiters coming up to check up on us to make sure everything was ok. The moment you flip your thing (not sure what to call it) to ""Yes"", the servers came so quick and they were very attentive. There was a server who came around with random appetizers and I loved it all! They also have a buffet section where you can grab smoked salmon, fruits, rice, beans, soup, etc. I got the corn soup from the buffet and it was absolutely delicious. I literally had 4 servings of it. I will be returning here the next time I come to Boston. Thank you for exceeding my expectations!Also, they're right across the street from Lawn on D and it was the perfect place to digest all the delicious food we ate.",5,7/16/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
703,"When steak comes to mind. This is the place you go to. Can be on the pricier side but the quality of the food and service is next level.

The food served is outstanding and the wait staff treated us like family. We had reserved for a party of 12 but had an extra person. They readily added another table without any hesitation. Surprisingly all of the cuts of meat were of high quality for an all you can eat restaurant. The soup and salad bar had a wide variety of options and was fresh while tasting delicious. This is definitely a must try restaurant!",5,8/5/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
706,"Absolutely amazing, from beginning to end.Came on a weeknight for my birthday because I love Brazilian food. The steakhouse is a typical set up with appetizers/salad before they bring the meat around. What stood out was the quality of the food and the service. My GOD, the service. Truly incredible. I mentioned that lamb was a favorite of mine, and they brought out mint jelly to eat with it. When we wanted more ribeye, it appeared instantly. Best caipirinhas I've ever had, plus a slice of mango-passion fruit cheesecake on the house. I was blown away by how friendly and excellent the service was, and of course the steak/sausage/lamb/chicken was to die for. I will be returning as soon as I finish digesting, although that may be roughly the time of the next Olympiad. 5 f***ing stars. Obrigado!!!",5,8/10/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
707,The food is fine. Been there several times. But what is the point of a reservation system if you get there and they still make you wait 30 minutes and seat walk ups before honoring your reservation. They would have received 1 star for this but the food is decent.,2,8/12/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha
708,"Really enjoyed my lunch here. I don't usually do well at buffets but I ate so much. The meats they served were great. Variety of sides in the buffet for adventurous or more bland palates, cheesy bread was so good, along with some cultural staples like the fried yucca and plantain they bring to each table. The caipirinhas  were a bit difficult to drink because they were muddled and kept getting stuck in the straws but still really good. Ambience inside is nice. Service was great. Would love to go back at some point.",5,8/22/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha

710,"I have been meaning to try this his restaurant for awhile.  It is in the hotel and easy location to visit.I didn't have reservation and planned to eat at bar. I was told they do not serve the meat sliced off the swords in bar area . I was alone and hated to take a table when someone else could utilize... but I was here to be a carnivore with a vivacious appetite.  I visited salad bar first and nice fresh options,,but limited fruit options. The apple pear salad was very good,,cheese fresh and nice selection. Corn creamed soup,  I read was good and it was cold, but was good. The fresh cheese bread excellent, the grilled bananas excellent... I would have those for desert with some hot Carmel sauce and scoop French vanilla ice cream.Now the meat starting arriving and all very good high quality. Lamb chops excellent. Now I must have exceeded their consumption expectations... do now  the meat slices served at this point were all the fat and gristle. Many I didn't take the hint... I stack it up on the inedible plate ... must have looked unappealing to incoming guests as when they saw my pile of fat... they promptly moved it from table... then the pace of serving slowed, the chicken and sausages started being offered. I sensed they were now hinting for me to leave to get table for next guest. I had ordered a beer, I had to ask for it mid way during eating Bessie the cow.I did reward with 25% tip. Deserts looked excellent, but I passed as felt time to leave.I'll go again but probably just something appetizer in bar area. Was a nice atmosphere; even tho I was seated at the least desired table. I am not easily annoyed.  I felt they needed more meat options like some other Brazilian restaurants.It was a busy Friday night with guests at hotel looking for checking in and dinner.  A few birthdays celebrations and nice date outing for someone out for special occasion. I would given 4-5 stars but my inedible gristle servings kinda turned me off... had I eaten hose slabs...,I'd be at the Mass General hospital down the street with the metal shock paddles on me.",3,8/26/2022,Restaurant Alma Gaucha

If turned out to be four skewers , with 3-4 pieces of chops/ shrimp/ chicken - Huge! Everything was good and chops were really juicy! I also had the Tres Leches cake - super moist , right amount of sweet ( one of the best I have had). The next day I went back for salad bar ( which is half of the price of the full menu). I liked the variety and it also came with palate cleansers ( polenta) as well as sweet fried plantain. The staff is also very accommodative.

The sauces were amazing too, you get to choose 3 of them.Sadly avocado was missing altogether from my bowl. And the person who was making my bowl had their mask on their chin.Taste was a 5 on 5, but one star less for the missing avocado and mask issue.I will definitely visit again.",4,2/24/2022,Dig
717,"This is a brand new edition to the lunch bowl scene in Kendall Square. It joins the likes of Cava, Sweetgreen, and Chipotle. The vibe is more SweetGreen meets healthy comfort food. They have greens, but for the most part the sides are very hearty and mostly hot. It's comfort food you can feel good about eating. The price point is comparable to Sweet green and Cava. If you sign up for an online account, they'll give you $5 off an order (not a paid promo).The good:- Brand new so no wait or lines at peak lunch time! - clean, inviting place- low key staff- lots of choices, decent portion size- garlic aioli is delicious!- they don't charge for bags.- super close to MIT East Campus- Nice seating areaThe just ok:- food itself was ok. Nothing to write home about. - the cauliflower and Mac n cheese were a bit more charred than I like, bordering burnt.- meatballs were beef and chicken, but also had very noticeable filler (looked like some rice and veg), not bad but interesting. Clever way to use leftovers?The bad: - 2 of the employees handling food were maskless. There's still a mask mandate in Cambridge and even sans mask mandate, it's just good hygiene for those handling/cooking food to not be breathing their germs on it. I'll be back to try another bowl!",3,2/28/2022,Dig
718,"I was staying at the Marriott nearby and was too tired to venture far for dinner. Dig was open late and offered a reliable and hot meal. I stepped in around 7:30pm and had my standard bowl of half farro/half mixed greens with roasted chicken breast, charred broccoli, and mac & cheese. Staff were quick and friendly. I had lunch at around 1pm, so I was pretty hungry by this point. My bowl was really filling and really hit the spot after a long travel day.",4,4/6/2022,Dig
719,"I always pass by Dig and decided to finally give it a try. The food tasted healthy and fresh. I ordered one of the popular menu items, but next time I would try building my own. I really liked the indoor/outdoor feel with the windows fully open. I'll be back!",4,6/8/2022,Dig
720,"i got a custom bowl: - 1/2 greens and 1/2 farro (although there were barely any greens) -- farro was really good- carrots (super tasty)- broccoli (a bit too large and charred for my liking, but good flavor wise)- asparagus (really good! who wouldve thought mint would be good with asparagus??)- charred chicken -- amazing. chefs kiss. tender. total came down to about $15 which is a lot given its smaller portion size compared to cava and sweetgreen.",4,6/11/2022,Dig
721,"General Overview: Dig has always been one of my favorite grab-n-go places in town. It's filling, fresh, healthy, and also fast!Ambiance: I LOVED the ambiance of this store, it looked so modern, the bathrooms are so clean as well.Food: The food tasted tasted like general Dig food. I got the extra avocado and pesto sauce which really enhanced my bowl but since 2017, Dig has never disappointed me!",5,6/13/2022,Dig

725,"Monument is what Charlestown desperately needs: a neighborhood gathering place with great, reasonably-priced food and no attitude, right in the heart of the Town. They had me at the Iggy's bread that's served with whipped ricotta drizzled with honey. Being that it was opening night, they still have a few kinks to work out. Since the kitchen is open, you can see all the prep happening. We had the table right next to where the chef was calling out the orders, so we were getting a preview of all the plates coming out, and were trying to guess what each was from the menu. Our food was taking a while, so the chef sent over an order of the Kung Pao brussel sprouts/snap peas. They didn't disappoint. Erica, our server was very apologetic, but we were enjoying watching the show. I had the brussel sprout and crunchy quinoa salad. It was topped with salmon which had a crispy crust on the outside and was tender inside. My husband had the cod, which was delicious. We also had the donuts for dessert. They coated in sugar and have warm chocolate filling inside. I was glad we were walking home. Monument is not to be missed. I'm so happy to have such a great place in our neighborhood!",5,1/3/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
726,"FINALLY! Thank you Monument for giving our neighborhood an amazing new restaurant! I went last night with a few friends. It was packed! Wait was only 15-20 mins. HUGE bar - must be 20-30 seats - and full bar, which is another perk. Down-to-earth staff gave us honest reviews of food. Iggy's bread with to-die-for dip followed by kung pow brussel sprouts (could have eaten the entire bowl myself) and tuna tartare (delish) then I had had the short ribs (delicious) and my friends had the gyro and the pork milanase. HUGE portions so easy to share. Bill was super reasonable given we had a bottle of wine too. John came over to check on us a few times and we had a fantastic night! Can't wait to go back.",5,1/5/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
727,"Monument is exactly what Charlestown needed. Better food and atmosphere than the sports bars in CTown, but prices for food and drinks were very reasonable. It is a place you can go any night of the week. I tried the brussel sprouts appetizer which was great, I love the added sichuan peppercorns. The cod dish was very tasty, with the chowder sauce adding even more flavor, and the chimichurri sauce on the steak had me cleaning the plate with bread to make sure I didn't miss any of it. I tried one of their classic cocktails and one of their not classic cocktails and both were made well. It was very busy night, since they just opened, but our server still took the time to discuss the menu and help with gluten free choices. I see myself having dinner here a lot.",5,1/7/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
728,"I don't usually write yelp reviews but this place knocked it out of the park, so I had to!I had heard this was open so my boyfriend and I went down last night- and low and behold it was their grand opening to the public. We expected it to be busy but it was definitely packed! They quoted us a 2 hour wait at 8:15 so we got a couple of drinks at the bar- the McAvoy and the Morning Glory. Both were amazing. Especially the McAvoy, a great after dinner drink or for someone who likes sweet drinks. Anyways, we ended up being lucky and grabbed some seats at the bar after an hour or so. We had the French Onion Soup Meatballs that were PHENOMENAL. Really hit the spot. My boyfriend had the Smash burger and I had the Pork Milanese- which was huge. They hit it out of the park on both occasions. We wanted an espresso martini to cap the night but they didn't have espresso, but one of the managers made a vanilla martinis with dark coffee, chocolate, and an ancho chili liqueur. It was exactly what I wanted, without knowing it! They also have us a shot of Cooke Swan complimentary, which was a pleasant night cap!The atmosphere is great; very cosy, trendy, but classic. It was packed but wasn't loud. If you live in Charlestown you will definitely bump into familiar faces. The prices are also perfect- cheaper than going downtown for dinner and you get better food than some places. I usually give restaurants about 3 months to get into their groove and get the kinks out, but Monument is already doing an amazing job- unlike some other restaurants in the neighborhood. It's a great addition too, exactly what Charlestown needed. It was busy but you didn't have to wait long to get attention and the kitchen was cranking the food out at an acceptable speed. I will be back and am so excited that this establishment is only a 5 minute walk from my house!!",5,1/7/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
729,"Have been eagerly anticipating Monument's opening and decided to give it a try on Friday night. They do not take reservations, which I like, but apparently the rest of Charlestown was just as excited as I was to give the new spot a try and the wait time was 2-2.5 hours, which wound up being accurate. The bar area was so crowded it was hard to get a drink during the wait, but the drink list and the quality of the cocktails were great! The bartender was clearly knowledgable, quick and helpful once he spotted us. We had the last table next to the kitchen which was busy with servers squeezing by frequently, but that afforded us sneak peeks of all of the dishes the kitchen was pumping out. The menu has a fantastic variety of dishes, and they all looked great coming out of the kitchen, the portions are a great size though many looked fairly heavy with oil. Our waitress was wonderfully helpful (and patient!) with us to choose between all of the options. We went with the short ribs over mac and cheese, and the seared skirt steak with snap pea chimichurri. The short rib dish was less mac and cheese-y than we though which was alright considering the heaviness of the short ribs. Overall the dish was good, but the short ribs were excessively fatty and it was over-salted. The seared skirt steak was great, I would order it again down the line when the kitchen is more familiar with the dishes and seasoning. The polenta and snap pea chimichurri were good but in a pool of oil on the plate. The steak portion was generous and cooked perfectly, but again very over-salted. The flavors were definitely there, but the excess oil and salt took away from how amazing it could have been. All in all I left with a good impression of the food, it just needs some fine-tuning (and I would be shocked if there was nothing that needed tweaking for being so brand new!).The interior is trendy and industrial-shabby-chic and the ambience is fantastic. All of the staff were incredibly welcoming, helpful, and happy to be there- and for how packed it has been in their first week of opening, kudos to them for running so smoothly and not letting the neighborhood see them sweat! It was a very welcome change and great experience compared to other restaurants that have opened in Charlestown recently. Overall, I am thrilled to have Monument in the neighborhood and I am looking forward to returning on many more occasions!",4,1/8/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
730,"The atmosphere, food and service were great! To start, they serve their bread with a ricotta & oil dipping sauce that is out of this world! We also ordered a Margherita pizza and calamari! Again- no complaints... fresh and tasty! To top it off the doughnuts were unreal!! They were filled with a hot chocolate sauce and served with some other delicious dipping sauce! Doug- our bartender was awesome! He was very accommodating. This place is a must try!",5,1/9/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
731,"FIRST WEEK REVIEW - went Sun 1/8 - a week after open. Yes it was packed, yes they will work everything out, this is what professionals do. There's some really good here, and a few opportunities to capitalize on for improvement. I'm very happy for this ownership team's continued investment and to reboot the space, and the confidence they've earned from the City of Boston (they won a rarely awarded upgrade to a full liquor license).Most of the staff are hustling, it's evident even when the place was packed. The bartenders need training and coaching, and / or throw bodies at the situation - they're in the weeds and are struggling and seemingly not caring enough (5:30pm). The kitchen is being run very well to accommodate the volume, hiring an expediter was a brilliant move. The food is pretty damn good too. Kung Pao Brussel Sprouts & French Onion Soup Meatballs are fun and delicious standouts. Our mains were the short rib, and the soppressata pizza. Two recommendations - 1) short rib / mac n cheese - short rib was tasty, lil fatty (yes I know, it's a short rib); the mac n cheese sauce was waaay too salty, thin, and with scant cheese - tasted more like pasta water was used instead of a classic bechamel-based cheese sauce (details matter). 2) Keeping the oven was badass - just bite the bullet and honor the past - bring back the 'official' Paolo's Special (soppressata & kalamata olive pizza). And roll that crust out thin, and cook it well done. Truly the best pizza in the region, and I miss it.ONLY cons - I know you want this to be a neighborhood restaurant, I get it; and said neighborhood is now full of 'new' families that feel entitled to have infants in high-chairs in a loud, open concept bar / restaurant (no lie - 4 different tables had at least 1 infant). My faves were - the one that dragged their feet to play with baby & ipad instead of politely surrendering the table; and the one that was shrieking at the top of his little baby lungs into my right ear. If I were a server I'd be looking for ways to supplement my rent elsewhere because BABIES DON'T DRINK OR ORDER OFF YOUR MENU, and their parents don't compensate for the lost revenue. And they sure AF don't clean up after their undrunk baby throws its food all over the floor. Pro-tip--get a contract valet for strollers. All of this takes your staffs' time, and you pay your staff money, they rely on turns & tips, and fewer or slower turns costs everyone money.I will be back because I was treated very well overall, the staff is overwhelmingly positive, hopping, and on-point (coach the bartenders), and the food is good. I wish you the best of success and will do my best to contribute to that.",3,1/11/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
732,"First off, I'm basing this review on overall experience and knowing that they are still new so they are working out kinks. I really do like this place and will definitely be back. I totally understand that it's hard to control actual wait times for tables but we were quoted 1hr 15mins for a table. The hostess never came to let us know it was going to be longer and every time I went to check on the table status there seemed to be 6 other parties ahead of us. We actually had spots at the bar and would've been so happy to just sit and eat there but there were no chairs- You need enough chairs for both the bar & the tables!Anyway- after waiting 2(+) hours for a table, we were finally seated. LOVE the ricotta and bread they bring out when you sit. SO GOOD.We were starving at this point and had drooled over the menu for 2 hours so we put out order in quickly.Brussel Sprouts- way too salty. The flavor was good but salt level was insanely too high- my tongue is still swollen.Lemon Rosemary Wings- good! Crispy and flavorful- wish they they were a little more juicy/had a different sauce with them but other than that they were yummyMargherita- can't go wrong! Love the dough, sauce is delicious and overall just a yummy pizzaMeatball- this one was ok. I wouldn't go back for it- meatballs were small and dry, not what I was expecting. But still. good dough and sauce so there's thatCocktails were great, service is fast, food was good so will definitely be back for another try! Excited to have a spot like this so close!",4,1/13/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

734,"All of you folks who think waiting two hours for mediocre food are insane.  I can say that they are definitely experiencing new restaurant syndrome and do need to fix the kinks as everyone else has mentioned.  The waitstaff is great and the hostess was very apologetic for the wait.  We had the Pork Milanese and Margarita Pizza.  The pork was a very large portion, but that is what you get when you butterfly the chop out.  The resulting thin chop was overcooked and tough version of ""shake and bake""  The Milanese sauce was basically butter with capers in it and a tablespoon of volume to the chop.  The proportion of sauce to chop was ridiculous.  The Margarita Pizza was good, but not exceptional.  A basic pizza, but small in size compared to the larger pizza that was offered at Paulo's. I will return at some point in time, possibly 3 - 4 months from now, when they figure it all out to see if things have changes.  Paulo's was a Friday night favorite for us.  I was hoping this would be the same.",2,1/15/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
735,"Monument is my new favorite restaurant! We went last night for my boyfriend's birthday and were instantly in love with the decor, the service was outstanding, and food is out of this world delicious!!  My friend is pregnant and felt lightheaded when we got there and not only did the waitress come check on her but the manager also came by to check in with us followed by complimentary apps and desert! We have never been so impressed with a restaurant. Would give 6 stars if I could! Menu Highlights (really everything was good though!): Brussels appetizer, sweet potato appetizer, salmon salad, skirt steak, and butterscotch pudding. Seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu at Monument. :)",5,1/16/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
736,"Went for brunch. Nice ambiance, exposed wood everywhere, big sky light. As with most new restaurants they are still working out some kinks with service (nothing major).

Will be back to try the dinner/ lunch menu.",4,1/16/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
737,"Last night (a Wednesday night) I had a great experience at Monument.  We got there early (5:40PM) and it was already busy and lively.  We did get a table quickly, but I expect that getting there much later and you should expect to wait.  The good news is that there is a long bar if you have to wait.   The hostess was great and the servers were very nice, helpful with the menu and efficient.   The menu has great variety and items (especially in the appetizers) that I have never seen before which was a very pleasant surprise.  I had the French Onion Soup Meatballs (something I had never seen before) and they were excellent.  I also had the calamari and was impressed.  I then had the Bar Steak (Rib Eye) and it was cooked exactly how I asked (black and blue) with seared green onions and a very tasty sauce.  The portions are large and we were too full  for desert, but the table next to us ordered some and it looked great.   The prices are very reasonable.  Monument is going to be a great success and much more than the neighborhood bar/restaurant that many expected it to be.  I expect this will be a destination for people outside Charlestown as well.",5,1/19/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
738,"Went to monument tonight for dinner. It was very good. The bread and whipped ricotta was awesome. We started with the baked goat cheese and the brussel sprouts. Both were very good. For entrees I had the lobster special which was amazing. My friends had the short rib mac and cheese, skirt steak, ceased salad, tuna tartar and the scallops. Everyone loved their meals. So excited for another great restaurant to open in Charlestown. The service was very good. The place is very crowded with a busy bar scene.

740,"Living in Southie and being a frequent visitor to Lincoln, we were looking forward to trying Monument and their spin on a similar menu.  We got there at about 615 which I thought was early but still waited an hour and a half for a table.  Thankfully there was plenty of cheap (for Boston prices) wine at the bar to keep us busy.  We tried a bunch of appetizers - the brussel sprouts, sweet potato fritters, snap peas, poutine, and a side of mac and cheese.  Everything was really good - I'd definitely recommend trying it out!",4,1/27/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
741,"I really wanted to LIKE Monument a lot...but it fell short (see ""Cons"" below), albeit a ""new"" restaurant and one should go ""easy"" on them, via review process, because they may have some rough edges that require smoothing out; I would like to say that when i think about my experience last night and consider the fact that the restaurant manager never came by our table to check on us, get feedback, etc...in fact, he appeared to stand around and not be very helpful at the restaurant, that seals the deal for me, I won't be back.  There are a lot of rough edges here, but they won't be addressed and resolved properly w/ that type of leadership.PROS:- The decor is great, modern industrial look, there are a few TVs in the bar- Noise level is fun, happening, and I have no problem hearing my husband at the bar/table- bar service is quick and friendly, lots of local beers on tap- Menu is the ""right size"" good variety without going overboard on offerings.CONS:- We placed order after receiving bread - biscuits that were burnt on the bottom and ricotta cheese to spread on the biscuits - which is OK, except maybe we could have been offered butter or olive oil in a traditional sense?- Appetizer that came out - Sweet Potato Fritters - took a while to get to our table and they were burnt- Main dishes - kielbasa and spaetzel - the spaetzel was not a nice, doey German dumpling, but looked suspiciously like burnt croutons, I sent it back.- They totally forgot the Brussel Sprouts that we had ordered w/ our meal- Clam chowder that arrived at our table had huge chunks of potatoes and clam shells still on the clams in the chowder - not a fan of disassembling or assembling my clam chowder. - Ceasar salad was doused in dressing and I am sure it was not homemade- THE KILLER - I was really looking forward to the butterscotch pudding, which arrived like 20 min after we ordered, burnt pralines all over it and whipped cream that was not fresh, pudding was grainy in texture and had no taste...tasted like corn starch; I sent it back.- We were seated and there were 2 tables seated on either side of us, they got their apps/ secondary/ entrees in a very timely manner. (including brussel sprouts), pacing is very screwy.I will say that my check was adjusted for the Kielbasa, Brussel Sprouts (never rec'd) and Pudding.  3 times management was informed to remove items from our check. Management never came by my table.  What a disappointment.",2,1/30/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
742,"Amazing! I have been back every week and can't speak highly enough about the quality of the food.  I can't live without the French Onion Meatballs they are amazing and it's hard to not try something else so I always get them and bring home the left overs.  They do Brussel Sprouts right never disappointed.  The salmon over shaved Brussel sprouts and kale salad is a nice lighter fare option.  The pizza is so good and great for take out, travels well.  The gnocchi was a great choice.  So hard to try new dishes because I love everything that I have gotten! I think I forgot to mention the fresh bread and ricotta, always warm and delicious.  Save room for the donuts you won't be disappointed.  Very friendly hostess staff, I could never manage those crowds.  I usually go early to avoid the wait but it's worth it!

743,"This place is a solid 4.5 stars. The food is excellent, the service is attentive yet not pushy (you are not rushed to leave), ambiance is warm and cozy, and they have a good selection of drinks. I take .5 a star off because the communication and accuracy about your wait time for a table is not great. You can tell that they're still figuring things out and they do have a relatively small kitchen, but there is a disconnect between what the host tells you your wait time is and what it actually is. Part of that too is because they don't rush you at the table, which is great if you're eating, not so great if you're waiting for a table. I think they'll get better at this over time, but for now, expect to wait at least 30 mins longer than you're told. Other than that, so great to have a solid restaurant with a liquor license in Ctown!!",4,2/3/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

I would definitely recommend the pizzas if you're looking for something that will definitely be delicious. Also recommend the lemon chicken wings and the kung pao brussels. This is a new spot, and typical of its Lincoln roots (I think?) there will likely be a wait.If you have the opportunity I would eat at the bar. The bartenders provide excellent service. Best bar service I've ever had besides Eastern Standard.The waitstaff in the dining area is a different story.

The first time I sat at a dinner table, the second time I sat at the bar and this time I sat at a high-top table: three unique experiences because each offers a different vantage point of this really cool setting. Tonight the waiter's name was Jeff. He was outstanding. The special was a handmade pasta with delicious shrimp.  We were lucky enough to have it served to us by the chef himself. It was absolutely delicious. The environment is laid-back trendy.  The food is very fresh. And the service is excellent. I cannot say enough about this establishment. It is obvious that they are paying attention to details and they really care how you enjoy your experience.  Absolutely confident in recommending Monument to friends and  to you.  Enjoy! P.S.

They serve warm bread with whipped ricotta and honey on the table as you wait- so I was instantly happy and impressed. The hostess and waitress were both incredibly nice and helpful. We split the Mexican corn and White pizza and both were delicious. My friend had Sangria and I had wine and we were both pleased with our choices.

I order the bacon benny which was amazing and my companions enjoyed the breakfast pizza and the huevo rancheros.Pale of Prosecco with its three juice mixers was a perfect addition at a great price.Points off because although our food came out fast, it came before our drinks which in the restaurant world is a big no-no and through us off when everything came at once. Our server Julia was THE BEST! Super nice and made our experience very pleasurable and i hope to see her next time I go. I will for sure be back for bunch, love having a place like this outside the city!",4,4/26/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
760,"I took some friends in town visiting for brunch on a Saturday! Prepare for a wait, and I say prepare because it is worth the wait. The atmosphere is amazing with high ceilings and a homey environment. My friend got the breakfast pizza which was a huge serving but also delicious, I had a slice since she couldn't finish! I had the prime rib hash along with my other friend, we couldn't resist doubling up! It was amazing down to the english muffin which I don't normally prefer! I would highly recommend, and I will definitely be back to try the other menu items because wow!",4,4/30/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
761,"Walked in with 9 family members at 430pm just before the dinner rush (I'm no rookie). Seated quickly. Nice menu, covers the bases and allows you to stay in or venture out of your comfort zones. Apps: carnitas tacos and pork/spring onion dumplings, no one spoke, just inhaled these - tasty. 4 kids did kids menu stuff, but the cheese pizza looked real good. 5 adults - 2 soft shell crab specials (wicked good, the best I've had in a while, and I'm good for two or three times a year), skirt steak (staff commented on it being a house favorite), HUGE pork chop plate, and a brick chicken. All adults reported they would be back. Dessert included one of everything - they only have doughnuts, strawberry shortcake trifle, and bitterscotch pudding. Donuts were the hit, then there were 4 kids! The pudding and trifle were above average too.High ceilings, low light, LONG bar. Felt neighborhood-like. We were seated in the bar area, so the noise level was elevated, but did not affect conversation. Several staff stopped by, including a manager or two, so we felt well taken care of. The beer/wine/booze menu appeared extensive, but we were a non-drinking crowd this time.",4,5/1/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
762,Awesome vibe and excellent food. I've been waiting for a long time for a place like this is Charlestown!,5,5/3/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
763,"Over priced for Its location, it should be in the navy yard or the middle of monument square. I love the atmosphere  and the quality of the food however the price was too high for the portion in my opinion. The food does have an artisan feel. I got a $21.00 salad that consisted of a few salad shrimp, maybe 1/2-1 avocado and a green well not worth it at all. If you got the cash go !!! I don't so I won't be returning",1,5/28/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
764,Food:  The food was ok.  The guacamole and tacos were both good but the pizza was really disappointing.  It was very soggy and it fell apart when picked up.  The soppressata on the pizza was not crispy.  The food at other tables all looked very good so maybe just avoid the pizza.  I only saw the brunch menu but there seemed to be a lot of good options.  Very good beer list.Setting:  Very nice space.  Our waitress was very nice.,3,5/29/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
765,"We went here for brunch and it was pretty good. It is decently priced and they give you huge portions. The only issues were that the service was a little slow and the food was pretty salty. We will be back soon though, definitely a great addition to Charlestown!",4,6/3/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
766,"Came here twice in one weekend- the atmosphere is great, and the food is delicious. For lunch, I had the Cuban sandwich. A little greasy, but nothing uncommon for a cuban. The side salad it came with was great. For brunch, I had the lemon poppy seed pancakes. Not super lemony, but still very good. They have a good selection of beers on tap and other drinks too. Definitely a great restaurant to go to in a area that's lacking quality food. A must-visit if you're in the area!",5,6/5/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
767,So awesome! It's such a cool place with amazing food! We spent my brother's 40th birthday here and everything was fantastic. I had the kung pao brussel sprouts and fava bean tortellini. So good.,5,6/6/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
768,"It really depends why you are here. The brunch is 4 star! If you are a single girl at the bar, it's a 1 star. The bartenders pay limited attention to girls without guys & the guys always get prime attention. Don't come without a date or they need more male bartenders.",2,6/10/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
769,"Today was the second time I've been here and loved it both times! I LOVE the decor and the vibe... it's fun but casual; very comfortable place to watch a game or hang out and catch up with friends! I got the pulled pork tacos and they were AWESOME. Burgers are yummy, too. Very happy to have this place just down the road from us. :)",5,6/11/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
770,"The Monument is an amazing addition to Charlestown! I've basically been going once a week since they opened, I can't stay away. The food is absolutely incredible. I've had just about every appetizer and they do not disappoint! I highly recommend going on a Taco Tuesday. I'm typically a strictly wine drinker, but their drink menu is so good I've been venturing out of my comfort zone and trying a new drink every time I'm in. Depending on when you go, there can be a bit of a wait, but it's totally worth it! I cannot say enough amazing things about this place!",5,6/12/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
771,"Finally!!  A vibrant, fun restaurant in Charlestown that serves something other than pizza!  I've been to Monument several times, and I've had a terrific experience each time I visited.  The service is warm and friendly, and the food is extremely good. I think the pork tacos from the appetizer menu are particularly delicious, and the burger is one of the best I've ever tasted.",5,6/13/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
772,"I was there last night because my friend raved about it. I definitely don't see the hype here. The food was just ok and I had a bite of my friend's pizza, I think the pizza shouldn't be soggy. My calamari needs some salt.  I don't think i will go back there again.",2,7/13/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
773,"The first time I went to this restaurant I sat at the bar and the service and food was excellent. The second time I went here I was with people from work for drinks (we were in the bar area) and we were told by the waitress we all had to be on the same tab (even though we were in small groups). At the end of the night, my colleague received a bill for $60 even though she only ordered two beers.  She wasn't happy but she paid the bill. A few days later, she checked the amount on her debit card and there was an additional $3.00 added to the gratuity. She contacted a manager and he  removed the additional $3.00. She also told him about the issue with the tab and he stated it wasn't the policy of the restaurant to force people to be on a tab.",2,7/16/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
774,"Four of us (original townies) had Sunday brunch to try out the new place (since the old Paolo's). Great space-airy, spacious. Wonderful service from Jillian--easily accommodated my mom's walker, requests to change our food items. Two of us split a huge omelet with smashed potatoes, the others had the prime rib hash which was delicious. Good coffee too.  The dining chairs were really small and uncomfortable (we are not large people),  but otherwise a really nice establishment.",5,7/16/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
775,Love this place. Went for brunch..great cocktails. Peach Bellini was amazing. Cubano was delicious. Love that you can get half salad and half fries as a side- pure genius. Server seemed miserable and she was not happy to wait on us but I don't blame the restaurant. Everything else was great.,5,7/25/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
776,"I'm normally not too crazy about the dough component of pizzas, but theirs have such a nice texture and wood-fired flavor, I eat the entire slices. The White pizza with pears and honey is a favorite. Lemon rosemary chicken wings are also so yummy!",5,8/6/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
777,"We needed a restaurant like this and honestly, we still really need more. It is crazy to me how crowded Monument is, even on a given Tuesday night. I think it's kinda telling.. we need more restaurants in Charlestown... Anyway, expect a wait, especially during on the weekends. We've been here quite a few times and it's similar to it's sister restaurant Lincoln in Southie, although with a slightly older crowd. The Menu is completely solid with solid cocktails. I really, really enjoyed the brussel sprouts (those were ridiculously good and you should order those) and the only ""eh"" item was the guacamole which desperately needed salt. Definitely a welcomed addition to the neighborhood!",4,8/16/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
778,"I simply love this place! We live in Charlestown and it's our go-to. Great rotating tap and their food is delicious. I've been here a handful of times in the last 4 months, service is always great and the food never lets us down. We never mind the wait when there is one. The staff has always been friendly and helpful when we can't decide what to try.",5,8/20/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
779,"Great food and a comfy vibe inside.  We had lunch and a few drinks and everything from the quality to the service was spot on.  I plan to go back again.  The tacos were awesome, fresh made corn tortillas. Shaved ribeye steak sandwich was good comfort food and not too heavy.",5,8/24/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
780,"5 stars for ambiance, service, location, beer selection and food! Pizza is their specialty and that translates over into the food. There really isn't a bad thing on the menu. One of my favorites!",5,8/25/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
781,"I heard amazing things about this place from when I moved to the Boston area so I wanted to check it out. I thought it was okay, not sure if it's worth going back for, or really what the hype is? We got brussels, a margarita pizza, and drinks. The brussels weren't amazing- not bad but not great. The pizza's bread was good, but even for a margarita pizza it had little to no cheese on it. With so many places to try in the Boston area I'm not 100% sold on this one...",3,8/31/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
782,"I've been here enough now to say that I love it.  The menu is diverse and mostly delicious!They probably can't help it, but they certainly are too crowded for most of dinner service.  They are not consistent enough with quality and service to get a better rating. Tiny things, e.g. a very sticky bar area, wilted lettuce in a salad, too warm in the restaurant on hot days (leading to a way too warm glass of wine). Fix these, easily get another star.",3,8/31/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
783,"Meh, It was not all I thought it would be. We came here after seeing this restaurant on WCVB's Chronicle. And honestly I was a bit disappointed.  The decor is nice, the wait staff was friendly and attentive. We were seated at a table so close to kitchen/prep area, I could feel the heat  on my face. There shouldn't be a table there. It's too close. This area is also where the wait staff put in orders and do the checks.Its a busy congested space. Again eliminate this table. Anyways on to the food. The menu leaves a lot to be desired. Lots of peas and heavily worded items.  We started with the ""lemon pepper"" wings. These wings taste like absolutely nothing. As well cooked as they were, they were missing flavor. We had to add pepper(no seriously we did). I ordered the salmon and was just ok, I could take it or leave it. Nothing special. My husband had the skirt steak. He was so displeased that he ordered a pizza from their menu instead. For dessert we had the chocolate donuts holes. Get the donuts, they are best thing I had and if I am ever in Charlestown again I'd go back for the donuts and take them to go.  My take on this place: Order a pizza, get the donuts to go.",2,9/11/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
784,"GET THE BRUNCH. And the pizza here is bomb.com. Also phenomenal wings. Oh and the poutine definitely get that.My only gripe is that they actually serve you WAY TOO MANY FRIES with the burger, like we're talking an entire ocean of fries to the point that it looks like they just dumped the rest of the friar out to start a new batch (but every time). Weird gripe I know but you really can't take fries home for leftovers, so cool it with the fries!!Otherwise, up there with the best in Ctown.-ctown food connoisseur",5,9/12/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
785,"My wife and I have wanted to try this restaurant for a long time and we made our way to the Tavern after work on a Friday.  The place looks unreal to someone who knew the previous businesses that were in the spot back to cagney's video in the 80s.  We sat at the bar and had some of the best service I have had in a long time (I wish I got the female bartender's name). Prompt and attentive she gave my wife recommendations and made a great drink! The menu seemed small but that had the right mixture of different items on it to please most appetites. We had the wings as a appetizer - we probably got about 8 wings for 12$ but they were large and delicious with a great lemon taste.  I didn't care much for the side buttermilk dressing (the dill over powered the lemon of the wings) but my wife loved it.   We decided to split the steak and cheese pizza..WOW some of the best (nontraditional) pizza I have ever had!  The dough was certainly the best I have ever had on any pizza, soft and extremely tasty. the peppers were a mix of sweet with a tad of cherry pepper bite to them (awesome), the onions tasted lke they just came from a french onion soup which was amazing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the creative twists they added to their menu items and would recommend this place to anyone in the area or looking for a new place to dine.",5,9/16/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
786,Food and service were awesome   The waitress was excellent. We had several appetizers the best was the rice balls followed by a mussel special. One of our group had a burger. The meat was fresh and tasty. I would definitely go back again.,5,9/22/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
787,"This place is total amateur hour. The wait time they quoted us exceeded an hour beyond what they quoted us. That would have been ok but the bar is cramped and bartenders not helpful. Not a festive vibe. And, I've eaten there before and the food is not that good. When you put it all together- I give the hype a  year.",1,9/30/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
788,"I got pick-up from this restaurant so I can only attest to the food, but it was absolutely delicious. I got the steak and cheese sandwich with the truffle aioli- hands down one of best sandwiches I have had. And I was definitely a fan of the shoestring fries which I dipped in the side aioli sauce of course!",5,9/30/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
789,"This place is a gift to Charlestown! The food is different and creative but also of good portion and a semi-reasonable price. There are many options for ether light fare, splitting a pizza or a whole meal. There are great beers on tap and the bread and ricotta is actually one of the best things your mouth will ever meet! Don't miss Taco Tuesday!",5,10/10/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
790,"Live in Charlestown and agree with others who have said we've been overdue for a place like this.  The decor is cool and the place has an energetic vide.  Food and drinks are really good, a great  little gastropub.  I'm a fan of the Bjorn Identity cocktail and my wife like's the Bee's Knees.  They also have a solid selection of beers.  For apps we love the Lemon Rosemary Chicken Wings , Brussels Sprouts, and Calamari.  Our dinner choice is often the Chicken Kale Salad which comes with the same yummy buttermilk dressing as the wings.  Have also sampled the Brick Chicken, Scallop Paella and the Salmon.  All were tasty and prepared as ordered.My new go to spot .",5,10/18/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
791,"Went for lunch recently.  Sat at the bar, place was pretty busy but not too loud. Beer selection was excellent, and bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable. Food was outstanding. Wife and I had the Kung Pao Brussels sprouts which was delicious, but our favorite was the salmon Poke Bowl. Amazing combination of the freshest salmon, cucumber, sticky rice, ginger aioli and more. Incredible. We then split the pressed Italian sandwich, which, with its olive salad and fresh meats,tasted like a delicious muffuletta. The restaurant itself is beautiful, the staff is terrific. Can't say enough, can't wait to go back.",5,10/28/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
792,"Neighborhood go to!  Great pizzas and the brick chicken is awesome.... nice beer selection on tap and heavy poured wine glasses of a good selection as well.Only complaint is that this place is hot, sounds weird but it never seems to be a good temperature and I usually walk 10 mins to get there walk in and can't cool off.Is basically busy every night perfect for charlestown, both young and families",5,10/30/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
793,I went here with a friend for lunch and i am not a fan of a lot of food. When I looked thru the menu there wasn't much I wanted to order. I settled on the Steak and cheese which I do not see on their menu anymore!! I was really happy with it they made it just the way I ordered it and it was good. My friend had the Smash Burger and loved it. I really miss the Italian place that was here before and haven't tried the pizza yet. I am the worse pizza critic out there been making them for years now so I know my pizza! We keep saying we are going back I'll have to try something else if the steak is not offered anymore.,3,11/1/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
794,"I've only been here a couple of times. Once during blackout time of 3:00-5:00 pm when all you can get is pizza and wings, and once for lunch. The service is good and the decor is cool. They have a good beer list and the bar is stocked with some great spirits.The food is just ok and a tad pricey. Frankly you can get better pizza at Brewer's Fork and better wings at The Blackmoor. I have not been there for dinner or brunch, so I can't speak to those.If you're looking for a cool spot to meet for a drink and a snack, I'd say this is a good option.",4,11/5/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
795,"We called to set a reservation on a Sunday late morning for brunch. We were informed that the reservations were all full for the day but we could walk in. We arrived at 11am and were told it was a 45 to 60 minute wait. We said that was fine and found an area to wait in. 70 minutes later there were numerous empty tables and we thought we were finally going to be seated. We watch as numerous groups that arrived after us are seated until all the tables are now full again. We went to the hostess stand to figure out how much longer we needed to wait and were inform reed that there were 4 groups in front of us as well as a few reservations. We asked how long they estimated that would take and were told another hour. I understand that this is a popular restaurant, however they should give an accurate wait time. If we knew going in it was going to be a 2 hour wait we would have gone elsewhere. We will not be going back to this restaurant to be lied to again.",1,11/5/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
796,We went there for lunch we had been here before when it was an Italian restaurant. The monument is a great improvement everything was fresh prepared well and excellently presented,5,11/8/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
797,"Highly recommend the Monument. I love the atmosphere here-its such a warm and friendly Tavern with a great beer list! The food is delicious. I went for dinner and had the Ricotta Tortellini recommended by the waitress-so tasty. I wanted to save some to take home, but they were so good I devoured the plate. I went for an early dinner mid week, and by 8pm the place was hopping, its definitely a local after work hang out.",4,11/10/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
798,"I have been here many times. No matter what everyone orders in the group, it never fails to be incredible. The beer selection is top notch, rotating in new ones regularly. First place I was exposed to Lunch and Fox Farm. The bread and butter they give to start the meal is alone worth a visit.",5,11/17/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
799,"I have been to monument for lunch, dinner and brunch and have had a wonderful experience each time. The hostesses are great and always accommodate our family (which isn't always the case with a 2 year old). The wait staff is friendly and the food delicious.

800,"We were in Boston for a weekend for my birthday and picked Monument solely on Yelp reviews and the fact that we could walk to it even in a snowstorm m, and I hope my review helps some folks do the same! A great, lively tavern atmosphere with really great food including brick oven pizza and traditional modern entrees. I had the beef short ribs with charred broccolini and cheddar mac and cheese, while my partner had the brick oven pizza with pear, fontina, and ricotta. We also started with the patatas bravas, which were excellent if not traditional. Portions were extremely generous, and the service was *very* friendly. We did have to wait for a table on a Saturday night but the beer and wine selection makes that totally manageable! Definitely worth a look!",5,12/9/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
801,"I've been here a couple times, each time thinking it will be better as it moves through growing pains. The first time I went at 7:30 PM on a Wednesday and waited 1.5 hours (kept getting the ""30 minutes"" every half hour until I decided to stop waiting) and grabbed a seat at the bar. The bartender said the brick chicken was good, so I ordered that and was so unimpressed. Super bland. I recently ordered takeout and couldn't believe how bad it was (and I will pretty much eat anything). I got the egg BLT with lemon rosemary buttermilk dressing which was sloppy/soggy and SPICY! How or why, I don't know. My sister got the omelet and said it was also really bad. I'll be back for drinks and ambiance, but that's about it...",2,12/11/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
802,"I hardly ever feel compelled to leave bad yelp reviews but this was just ridiculous! My boyfriend and I decided to go here for brunch while we were staying in Charlestown on vaca for one night on our way up to skiing. Based on pictures and previous reviews, it looked great. We were seated quickly and given a nice booth, which was great. I am a vegetarian and therefore always tell my waiters before ordering - especially if I'm tweaking a dish that includes meat. I ordered the Benedict, which has bacon and braised bacon kale, but the waiter told me that would be fine and they would omit all of the meat ingredients. When my food came over eventually, I noticed specks in the kale and was sure it was meat. I asked the dish server and he told me the bacon was on the side, but I was still it was meat so I had my boyfriend try it. It was actually bacon and I then had to tell the waitress. She acted horrified and took it back to be redone, asking me if I wanted another drink. Uh YEAH, I did. My food took about 20 mins to redo and when it came back it was literally just poached eggs on English muffin... no hollaindase or cream cheese.. I could have done that myself. I was just happy to have the food, though. Then when we received the check, they had charged us for the drink that she made sound like it would obviously be on the house - and it should have. We disputed it so got it taken off but honestly my order should have been half the price too. It was absurd and I got absolutely jipped. Only giving a star because of the ambience and music.",1,12/31/2017,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
803,"Came to Monument for a New Year's Eve brunch with some friends who are ""regulars"" - now we know why!  We made reservations for 10:30 and were seated right away. The decor is very modern wth a lot of distressed wood (see pics), and the bar area is huge with plenty of seating. Despite the size, Monument did fill up quickly around 11:00, so I strongly recommend making reservations if you're coming for a weekend brunch. We got the breakfast pizza and the bacon benedict, both of which were amazing.  I could eat the bacon benedict every day (that is, if I didn't mind gaining 20 pounds). We brought some of the breakfast pizza home and it was just as good the next day. You'll probably end up doing the same as that thing is massive and way too big for one person. The menu had a lot of other traditional brunch dishes as well, such as french toast, huevos rancheros, etc., all with Monument's own twist on them. Prices are reasonable and range from $10 - $20.In terms of drinks, there are a lot of tasty-sounding cocktails and a solid draft beer list, but the real steal here is the Pail of Prosecco. For $38 you get a bottle of prosecco and a selection of delicious fresh juices. We got 7 decent-sized mimosas out of that, which you just cant beat when compared to normal brunch prices. You can also upgrade to a magnum size for $65 if you have a big party.Monument is our new favorite brunch place - definitely preferred over the ""fancy"" brunch places in Boston.",5,1/1/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
804,"We LOVED Monument!! For someone who hardly ventures to Charlestown, this was a great experience! For Yelpers that frequent Southie, it almost has a Lincoln Tavern-type feel to it. It was busy for a Saturday brunch and had a really fun vibe! For drinks, we got bloody mary's and the morning glory which is like a mimosa but with elderflower and citrus undertones. The iced coffee was a little watery but not too bad. To start, the 5 of us shares tater tots which were crunchy and delicious. I ordered the Bacon Benedict- it had so much flavor and the rosemary hollandaise was amazing. I didn't love how much kale was on them, it was a little too much, but there was plenty of bacon to make up for it!! The herb cream cheese was very unique but really tied the entire dish together.",5,1/8/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
805,"Had a great experience with my friends for brunch at Monument! The decor has cool rustic, warehouse vibes but still very modern. We went on a Saturday morning and it was busy, but we had a reservation and were seated in a booth by the bar. Everything on the menu looked so good, it was hard  to decide what to get! We started with drinks - Bloody Marys and Morning Glory's. I'm a new fan to Bloody Marys and really enjoyed Monument's! For me, it had a good amount of spiciness & they had a few garnish options to add so I chose the pickle spear. They didn't have any, so they gave me a a stack of pickle slices which was fine. My friends loved the drink Morning Glory. For food, I went with the Benedict per the waitresses suggestion. It was delicious! It was a generous portion of food, and I especially loved the cream cheese on the English muffin that gave the Benedict a little something extra. Good serving of bacon, though a little too much kale for my personal liking. The smashed potatoes were also crispy & delicious. We also got the tots as a side to split - they were perfectly cooked - crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I would definitely recommend Monument if you're in the area.We also drive here and were able to find street parking a block or two from the restaurant which was a plus!",5,1/12/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
806,"This restaurant in my home town has a wonderful vibe.While it's a bit noisy for 'older folks', the atmosphere is fun and vibrant.  My go to brunch item is the steak burrito. I think it's the smashed potatoes which put this item over the top. The bloody marys are very special; the tomato is light and yummy and fresh. Dinner is a toss up between the seared salmon, which is delish and fresh and bright, or the brick chicken. Yum! The staff is young, upbeat and very knowledgeable about the offerings. Monument brought a new vibe to Charlestown and has been very balanced in clientele, which is a good thing. Props to a kid who grew up here to wonderful parents, Damien Donovan, who is part owner.  I'd recommend you make a reservation, you'll be glad you did!",5,1/13/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

Highly recommend the Banana Foster French Toast for the sweet tooth or the lemon poppy mascarpone pancakes (super filling btw. 4 giant fluffy pancake). For more savory items, I'd go with the breakfast pizza :)",5,1/15/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

The beet salad - so good! I love beats with burrata so it would have been hard to disappoint me, but the dressing that came with it really made it.Brussels sprouts - must try. They're kung pao Brussels sprouts which is really different (and definitely not healthy!) but great.I would order again and definitely will go in person someday soon!",4,1/30/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

810,"My wife, baby daughter and I were in the area and were in need of some good lunch. Co-workers who lived nearby had mentioned this place a few times and one of them specifically mentioned how great they are with kids so I figured, why the hell not. We easily parked nearby and walked right in.The place was bustling but service was top-notch. We got a nice table with a big window and while slightly cramped (not enough space between the bench and the table itself), everyone had plenty of elbow room.We ordered some nice beers and some food to boot. We ordered the chunky guacamole to start ($10) and the large portion was amazing. It was some of the best I've ever had. Simple but incredibly well done. I then went with their brunch menu and settled on eggs Benedict ($13) which were tasty although very rich. The portion was big and I couldn't finish in spite of my best attempts at it. The wife had their smash burger ($14) which she said was very tasty as well.The place itself has a great vibe to it. A neighborhood feel but yet incredibly welcoming to outsiders. The service was top notch and their menu was varied enough where regular trips wouldn't get boring. They definitely have something for everyone.I cannot wait to return in the future and look forward to more great meals there.",5,2/12/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
811,"Great brunch and cool atmosphere. Their servers are also super friendly and helpful. Their cocktail list is a little strange, but their bar is fully stocked so you can get pretty much whatever you'd like. Would definitely recommend",5,3/4/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
812,GREAT food at reasonable prices and great atmosphere. Bustling but not so loud you have to yell to have a conversation.,5,3/24/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
813,"Stumbled upon this place after looking for a late night dinner spot on a Monday near our hotel after arriving in Boston on an evening flight, and so glad we ended up here. Ordered the grilled salmon salad and it was fantastic! Others in my group really enjoyed their pizza and calamari too. Friendly service, and we were seated right away and notified that we only had a few minutes to order off the dinner menu before it was pizza only. Will return next time I'm in Boston!",5,3/25/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
814,"I saw Monuments ""Cinnamon Toast Brunch"" on Instagram. The next morning, I had one of my own. I somehow stumbled into what will surely become a go-to brunch spot. I made reservations for Saturday morning at 9:45. When we walked in it was still pretty empty, but was pretty much filled up by the time we left. Parking was street and we got lucky by finding a near-by spot pretty easily. The space is incredible. The wood bar, exposed brick walls and high ceilings make it incredibly gorgeous. Salmon Lox Bagel - Their salmon lox is house cured and you can tell. It is very silky with a rich texture. Every bite was SAVOURY HEAVEN. One of the best I have ever had.My boyfriend had the Corn Beef Hash. Also, excellent. Cinnamon Toast Brunch - Vanilla Vodka, Kahlua, Cereal Milk. It's SO GOOD. Will probably start doing this to all my cereal milk. There is no doubt we will be back. Those lemon poppyseed pancakes are calling my name. If I could parallel park I would have taken myself out for Sunday brunch, but alas, will have to wait for my boyfriend to come home.",5,4/8/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
815,"I frequently visit Monument for brunch on Saturday/Sunday with the occasional week night dinner option as well. Being a Charlestown resident this spot is one of my favorites. Their brunch menu has something for everyone. Their avocado toast is a menu item I get each time. To be honest if you love avocado like I do, I recommend the black bean and avocado torta. Paired with a few peach Bellinis you can't go wrong! While they do have excellent brunch, dinner is just as good. They have different menu items throughout the week. From tacos, and dollar oysters to Frosè and ramen; the really know how to keep patrons coming back for new and exciting dishes.",5,4/10/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
816,"Really solid restaurant! I feel like my friend and I tried various dishes and many of them could've gone wrong, but they were all very delicious. I had the pepperoni pizza with hot honey. Chewy dough just the way I like it. My friend had the chicken sandwich on onion foccacia. It came with a heaping side of fries and salad. We also shared the salmon poke bowl, which I didn't have such high expectations for at a tavern, but it was DELICIOUS. Flavors were on point. All the portions were so generous and ambiance was great. Very busy--I walked in around 6 on a Friday night and it was already packed so I recommend making a reservation.",4,4/10/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
817,"Amazing!!! New favorite brunch restaurant in the Boston area. The lemon poppy seed pancakes are incredible. The service was good, our waitress was nice and helpful. Next time I am definitely getting the cinnamon toast crunch cocktail. Overall 10/10. Will be back!",5,4/16/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
818,"One of my favorite spots in Charlestown. They have a great selection of beer and cocktails. The food is outstanding. All cooked in a brick oven. The sandwiches are the best. I highly recommend the Ruben and Cuban sandwiches, they are very tasty. The pizzas are really good was well. It gets busy in the evening so I would recommend a reservation if you don't wanna wait for a table, though the wait is worth it.",5,4/23/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
819,"Incredibly Impressed with Monument's brunch spread. And coming from one of nine bro-heems here for a first time brekkie as a kickoff to a bachelor party, that's saying a lot!First, the atmosphere is spacious, welcoming and trendy to the max. So much so, it made me use the phrase ""to the max,"" which I never do.Second: Lunch on tap and killer Bloody Mary mix. For real, bottle and sellout immediately - it's thick, rich and full of... horseradish.  Third: Fried Chicken and Biscuit is a glorious mountain of pre-gaming grub, with a fresh and crunchy chicken fried, and her little broken yolk on top.  Served with smashed potatoes, I was super impressed.",4,5/5/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
820,"On vacation and staying in Charlestown. Found this place our first night and came back twice more. Had a different server every time but all three were good. Wings were amazing and the smash burger was the best. Great neighborhood vibe, good service, good drinks. Nothing not to like.",4,5/18/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
821,"This is our single favorite place in town. The beer is amazing, the food is great, and the staff are friendly. Great for catching a game too! My only complaint is they took away my favorite sandwich...even still, they're great. Give it a try!",5,6/29/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
822,"This fine restaurant deserves the positive praise it gets on Yelp for its food, drinks, and enjoyment. It can be quite difficult to get sat without a reservation, but it's well worth the wait. I tried the fried rice entree and am looking forward to trying more (e.g. brick chicken, etc.). You can't go wrong with any of the local microbrews on tap.",5,6/30/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
823,"We had a nice supper here, and will definitely come back, since we live nearby.  We went on a wickedly hot day (95 degrees at 6PM) and the air conditioning and fans were struggling a bit to keep up, but it was OK considering how miserable it was outside. The brussels sprout salad with chicken was good-- a little pricey at $18.00 with the chicken, but the vegetables were perfect and the dressing was good.  The chicken breast had been flattened or something to make the outside a bit crispy; it was tasty but definitely too dry.  The chicken sandwich and garden salad were also very good.  All the salad vegetables were really fresh, and the food came to the table quickly.  The beer and cider list was good, but I was kind of put off by the by-the-glass prices for wine and the cocktail prices.  I don't even want to pay that much in town.Our waitress was prompt with water refills, drink orders, and checking in to see how things were.  We had one kind-of-odd drink request (tonic water with lime, no gin) and she got it right.  You would be surprised how many seltzers or alcoholic G & Ts you get instead of ""tonic water with lime, no gin."")  The music wasn't too loud, the tables were a good distance apart so that we weren't on top of the people at the next table, and the lighting was good.  Hopefully that's the case if we go back on a non-Sunday night.The one weird thing was this:  there is an open kitchen, which we were seated next to-- and they were doing tons of work and putting out really good looking food.  Every single customer or waitstaff appeared to be white, however, while the kitchen staff all appeared to be Latino.  Charlestown has gentrified a lot over the years, but it hadn't ever been so visible to me as it was on this visit, when the only people of color in the place were working away in the kitchen.",4,7/6/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
824,"Fantastic dinner: love their Manhattan; watermelon salad with burrata was excellent; paella fantastic, with side of street corn - never go wrong. Delicious!",5,7/6/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
825,"Monument is a much needed addition to the casual dining landscape of Charlestown, MA. Arriving around 6 PM on a Saturday evening, the restaurant was busy, but not packed.  We were seated promptly, and exceptional service continued from there.  The staff is attentive, focused, and well trained.Their menu is born from the typical gastro pub ""new"" american style. You can tell that the ingredients are discerningly cultivated.  Preparation is pretty good.  Some aspects of the meal indicated a spectacular attention to detail where others indicated they were still finding their way.I had the Greek Steak wrap.  The steak was prepared excellently.  The tatziki needs improvement (if not a total overhaul). The filling of chick peas, grilled peppers & onions, kalamata olives, feta cheese, arugula similarly needs work.  Rather than put whole chickpeas in I would opt for a spread of humous.  Less is more when it comes to whole kalamata olives.  They should have been diced so they could contribute to the wrap in a more even and cohesive way.  Our waitress indicated that this dish was a new addition to the menu and it was easy to tell.  With some refinement this dish has the ability to be a standout!One of my fellow guests had the Mexican Street Corn which they rated very highly.  It was was served sprinkled with Cotija cheese as opposed to some of the cremas which I have previously enjoyed on Mexican Street Corn.  We also ordered the Smash burger.  It was also perfectly cooked and rated very highly by one of my fellow guests.The decor is well appointed and the atmosphere ably meets conditions for a fun and casual meal out.Prices are a bit high for the location, but not out of control.Monument is on our list to watch!",4,7/14/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
826,"I have never been to Monument but was pleasantly surprised this evening with a great atmosphere and great food for a group of four!Keep it relaxed, enjoyed attentive wait staff, and had a great time here tonight on our double date!",5,7/14/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
827,"Although we had to wait almost an hour or a table, the meal was legit. The place was crowded for a reason. The bar area was jam packed on a Friday night. A nonstop stream of locals came in to pick up to-go orders. Excellent pizzas. Funky flavor combinations. It's a little too loud for easy conversation, but it's a fun place.",5,8/5/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
828,"Best wings ever. Great atmosphere.  Awesome brunch.  Chicken sandwich, pizza, scallop dish, Brussel sprout salad...all are great picks!!",5,8/18/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
829,"First off, let me just say that I really, really, really miss this place. I lived literally right next door to The Monument before they opened. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but since there aren't too many options in Charlestown, I was eager to try it out. Well, I ate there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and I must say that everything I have had off their menu was incredible. The chicken wings--to die for. The pizza--delicious.But what really had me coming back every single weekend (no lie) was their lemon poppy seed pancakes. I made it a routine. Every Saturday, I'd wake up, prep for the gym, go downstairs to the Monument and sit at the bar and get me some of the best pancakes I have ever had. They put a generous layer of real whipped ricotta on top, give you a delicious side of berry syrup/compote, add some serious lemony zest, and top it off with some fresh berries. The pancakes are the perfect blend of light and fluffy and dense, so you don't feel overly stuffed after finishing the entire plate (which you most likely will). The service was also great, too. Everyone was friendly and chill, no attitudes to be seen and the level of coffee in my coffee mug was always attended to. I have since moved away to New York City, and I am going to be honest, I have yet to find pancakes half as worthy as the ones made at the Monument, and trust me, I've made it my personal mission to try every place I could to find pancakes that match theirs.So, my recommendation, if you are a foodie and love a good, rustic yet trendy atmosphere with great service, you must, and I mean MUST, try the Monument.",5,8/29/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
830,I love this place!  The atmosphere and space is incredible and the food is amazing.  The steak burrito they serve at brunch is incredible and super filling.  The guac is also amazing.Can get super busy as there really aren't many restaurants in Charlestown especially in this area but they have a huge bar and always are changing their cocktails so if you need to wait they make it worthwhile.,5,9/12/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
831,"Chicken sandwich was incredible. Half and half fries salad option as a side. Cool vibe, good beer selection.",5,9/13/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
832,"Delicious food, gorgeous dining room, very good service.  Also, I can get in and out of here quickly on my lunch break if I need to. The white pizza was my favorite. Haven't tried the drink menu yet. I'll have to come for dinner for that!",5,9/21/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
833,"Can't say enough good things about this place. There is nowhere like this in Charlestown, and because of this I HIGHLY suggest you make a reservation. Their menu is unique and friendly for anyone. Their staff is friendly and no matter how busy it is your food comes out in a timely manner. Great bar atmosphere and right now on Thursday nights they have live music. No complaints here.",5,9/29/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

835,The person I went with is extremely allergic to all nuts and Jon the manager was so wonderful and on top of it. He called about 3 weeks ago to ask about nuts and Jon reassured him that although there are nuts in the place he will do everything he could to make sure we had an amazing experience. When we made reservations he made sure to make note of it so his team knew as well. Last night when we met Jon was there to greet us. He checked on us multiple times and as did the chef and waitresses to make sure everything was safe. The food was absolutely delicious.One of our best dining experiences ever and you can tell Jon truly cares about his job. Thank you Jon! 1000% recommend,5,10/7/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
836,"Great Beer selection, they had several nice Hazy IPA's to choose from. The guacamole was great, the wings, also buffalo chicken pizza was great. Overall it was a great experience.",5,10/20/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
837,Love the history and environment of this place. The building just demands your attention. The food was good - pepperoni pizza with hot honey and a chicken sandwich with avocado. Good portion sizes. TV's at the bar for sports lovers but this place has plenty of natural light and an open kitchen so you can watch the masters at work.,4,10/26/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
838,"Stopped here for Brunch while exploring Boston & enjoyed the food/experience! Service was quick, but not rushed so we were able to enjoy coffee before eating. The kids ordered chocolate chip pancakes with a side of bacon. We also tried the breakfast pizza, special of the day - a croissant with ham, stone ground mustard, cheese, & a sunny egg, and the fried chicken biscuit. Portions were large & tasted excellent!",5,10/27/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
839,"After all of my visits to Boston, my expectations  were high. I started with a cabarnet savingon blend, turned out to be a bad choice. Sour, but tasty at all. I thought, maybe I should've started with a beer... Than for starter, a cup of chowder. Runny, with interesting bits of corn tasting good, larger chunks of bacon, out of place, and little lobster.İ didn't finish my wine, switched to a pale ale, which was the best option so far. Continued with Faroe Island salmon. They need to learn not to overcook it. It is really hard to mess it but, they were successful. So, back to pale ale. It was good",2,11/13/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
840,"Everything from the food which was great, to the service including, Lauren who seated us and looked out for us was really super. Fried chicken over a rosemary biscuit was hot, crunchy, juicy, and well seasoned. I had avocado toast with a perfectly poached egg on top with micro greens and a non tomato type salsa that was just the right fresh crunch with all of the creamy avocado richness. As good as the food was (and it was great) it was the staff that stole my heart. Thank you!",5,11/18/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

842,"I have been to Monument for dinner twice and everything I've had, from drinks to appetizers to entrees, has been magnificent. The service has been just as great.Recently, I threw my brother-in-law a surprise 40th there. The event was perfect! The food was delicious (per usual), the server was attentive, and a good time was had by all. Also, I let the managers I was planning with know ahead of time that I wanted to come in for dinner before the party. I was impressed to get a text while I was getting ready at home notifying me that my name was on the list. I was seated right when I arrived and was able to eat dinner before setting up the decor. Monument cares for every detail and makes you feel like you're the priority for an intimate occasion even though they are most often super busy.",5,12/7/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

844,"For fun, flavorful and delicious food, this is THE place to go in Boston. Every meal I eat here is outstanding and we eat here a lot. From brunch, to lunch, to dinner, to takeout, I am consistently impressed by the quality of the food. The menu is extensive enough for anyone to find something tasty that suits their palate. Each dish is a unique spin on a familiar favorite. The atmosphere of the restaurant is jovial and lively, and the decor is modern and industrial, with a revolutionary era throwback feel consistent with the Charlestown vibe we all know and love. We are lucky to have this restaurant in Boston!",5,12/28/2018,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
845,"I've been going to Monument since it opened and it is very solid.  Bar is great and the bartenders and servers are pros. Great spot to meet friends for a drink and watch the game too. Some of the menu items are terrific (salmon poke bowl, pimento sliders). They really need to change up their wings. They have 2 kinds but no buffalo wings or no tavern wings. I asked for plain wings before but they said they can't because they pre marinate them.",4,1/4/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
846,"We love this place - great atmosphere, great service. I talked with my gf & my roommate and we decided we would definitely give this place 5/5 if there were more veg options - tofu for the salad topper etc, especially for the price of the food. Otherwise, a amazing!",4,1/5/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
847,"Went here for brunch for the first time yesterday to celebrate a friends bday! Loved the atmosphere super fun and nice. Service was OK. Got to order just in time for brunch which ends at 3pm. We ordered a pail of Prosecco which I think is a great idea. Split the bacon Benedict and the lemon poppy seed pancakes. Both were really good! Loved the cream cheese on the bene and the honey ricotta on the pancakes was amazing. Wanted to order brunch drinks after the pail, but was surprised to know that they are over at 3pm. I'd like to go back to try another meal! Good spot.",4,1/20/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
848,"Monument Restaurant & Bar gives off a unique vibe. The tall ceilings and modern decor definitely pave the way to its chic ambiance. The food on this restaurant's menu is just as amazing as the atmosphere.

Highly recommend! #fivestars",5,1/23/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

The drinks for the experience are sub par.",3,2/16/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

851,"Courtney P. is a liar.  I sat next to her all night and had the pleasure of listening to her disparage other paying customers all night.  I am not one to meddle in other's business, but as a teacher, Courtney P. should be setting a better example and not spending her time bullying others.  She had at least 5 drinks, so I don't think she had any issue with the bar service.Amanda took care of everyone at the bar all night with a smile on her face.  The food was incredible as always and the service was even better.  This is the best restaurant in Charlestown and worth a trip.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu... and sit in Amanda's section if you can.",5,2/17/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

Oh yea and the burger....well you have to have one of those!",5,2/19/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
853,"Every time I've eaten here the food has been outstanding. My particular favorite is the chicken sandwich, the roll is so fresh and delicious mozzarella on top it is my go to menu item. The menu frequently changes but I have also enjoyed their mac & cheese and meatballs. Also recently tried the donuts for dessert. The server was very helpful setting up a friends birthday meal here.",5,2/24/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
854,"I am lucky enough to live right around the corner from Monument. My wife and I eat here once or twice a week and always feel aren't just ordering the same things over and over again. The food is all fantastic. You can get a few apps and share them. The beet hummus is outstanding. So are their wood fired wings and their carnitas tacos (2 per order). The pepperoni pizza is a stand-out. The honey drizzle? Forget about it. So good. I think the best part of Monument (beside the exceptional beer list) is the choice of food. Wanna pig out on cheat day? Go for it. Need a salad because yesterday was cheat day? Try the chopped kale salad or the shaved Brussels Sprout salad. You can split their massive sandwiches with one person or eat it yourself. Typically, we sit at the bar. The bartenders are super-helpful and very nice. They're open to letting people try beers and they're knowledgable. If you get Andrew, he'll talk to you about the beers all day. He knows his stuff and will recommend beers based on what you might like and even just slide a small pour of something you'd never think you'd like. Charlestown needed a joint like Monument. It's perfect for a few stops a week or splurging for a date-night.",5,3/2/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

858,"The atmosphere, location and service is very good. The servers and Bartenders are for the most part, very good.The food is average or slightly above. The pizza is very good. Poke Bowl is terrific and other items quite good. I wish they would change their sub-standard wing recipes that feature the same two tired choices since opening or soon thereafter. Please shake it up and offer buffalo and tavern wings. I've been going to the Warren Tavern to satisfy this urge instead of monument.",3,4/9/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
859,"Awesome spot! Laid back, interesting decor, cozy and best of all they were playing 90s alternative through the speakers. We started with their guac which was fresh and creamy.

860,"I live in Charlestown and regularly get food or takeout from monument. I wish I could give them a higher review however I have now TWICE gotten food with either plastic or glass in it. When they first opened I found a piece of glass in my donut. Luckily, I felt it and was able to spit it out without cutting my mouth. I gave them a break for being newly opened however today it happened again. I ordered the brussels sprout salad and bit down on a hard piece of plastic. They were nice enough to comp my salad (that's it) but it still does not excuse the recklessness of their kitchen. I am hesitant to go back for food. Proceed with caution !",1,4/14/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

They also have Monday dollar oysters which I would love to try.",4,4/16/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
862,The breakfast pizza is amazing.  I could eat it everyday.  Perfection.  Brunch here is absolutely delightful.  The hanger steak is the best dinner I've ever had.

Third time in a row bartender's friends are sitting at the bar and she ends up ignoring everyone. Then she starts running around because she has multiple tickets at the service bar, everyone sitting is asking her for checks and other things and standing people are trying to order drinks. I get it that you want to say hi to your friends but that shouldn't be at the expense of other customers.",3,5/19/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

867,We ate here a few years ago when it had just opened. Wide open placeWith super high ceilings. Nice long bar ...Just recently went to a fundraiser here a few weeks ago  and ate a bunch of complimentary apps. The wings were insanely good. Different rubs were awesome. Wings were huge and very tender. Not tiny and or dried out like most places. I'm really not one to eat guacamole but their homemade Guacamole was very good. Tortilla chips were awesome and warm.Wait staff were very attentive and pleasant. I will def have to come back to sit down and have the entrees. Can't wait !,5,5/26/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

The french toast with fresh strawberries, pastry cream, and a bit of granola - Real Maple Syrup my friends! The breakfast burrito - warm tortilla wrapped around delectable breakfast filling, oh yeah. The Lox & Spicy Everything Bagel - was just that. Peppery salmon with a perfect bagel and accouterments too. The fried chicken sammy was delicious with perfect crunch on both the chicken and the biscuit. Nice brunchy cocktail menu as well - just what we needed before departing Boston. Thanks Monument!!!",5,6/24/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
874,"My friends and I came here for the first time last night. We were blown away! The ambiance is perfect and the staff is super friendly. We each ordered a Smokey the Pear margarita, one of the best margs I've had and my friends loved it too. We had the crab dip for an app, it was amazing. Our meals were well prepared and quite flavorful. Our server, Emily was very nice, attentive, and provided great service. We will definitely come here again",5,7/6/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
875,We spent the day walking around Boston and ended up here based on a yelp search. We weren't disappointed. I had the grilled chicken sandwich ($14) which was delicious and came with salad and fries. I highly recommend it. The kids split a kids cheese pizza ($10). You won't be disappointed - great food and service,5,7/6/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
876,"This is a MUST go for brunch. We started off our experience with the 1.5 liter champagne for mimosas - awesome. The passion fruit was my choice for the splash of juice. Inside, this place is great! Open floor plan with high ceilings. I ordered the southern BLT and added an egg.... I've eaten a few southern style BLT's living in the south. This is hands down the best sandwich I've had. I was actually sad when it was gone. Other orders at our table included the breakfast pizza and the bacon Benedict. Everyone raved about their meals. My brother lives here, we are visiting, and he said he'd be making this his go to brunch spot with friends.Y'all gotta try this place!! I'd love to try their dinner next.. I'm drooling thinking about how good that would be!",5,7/6/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
877,"Went to Monument twice while on family vacation. We love this place. Really has something for everyone. Great beer selection, great kids menu. The sandwiches, the bread, the fries, the wood-fired oven. It's all so good. The service was excellent as well. If you are in the area I would make this a must stop.",5,7/16/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
878,"IF HEAVEN IS REAL MONUMENT SERVES FOOD THERE.This place consistently is just flat out amazing.A MUST for brunch. That French toast though....Dinner options constantly deliver as well.Lucky to live in Charlestown, would travel here even if I didn't.If you haven't checked this place out your missing out.",5,7/20/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
879,"Trendy brunch spot in a large space, good for getting a civilized midday buzz with your friends.  I ordered the wood fire roasted chicken wings (read: not fried sports bar wings) and breakfast ramen.  The wings were the highlight of the meal.  The meat retained it's moisture (not frying oil) within a crunchy char of the seasonings, to the point that only a dab of the buttermilk and chili dipping sauces were necessary.The breakfast ramen is really just a carbonara with ramen noodles.  Sure there's bacon and avocado on top to align it with millennial breakfast demands, but once the fried egg mixes with the bacon-cheddar ""broth"" - I  say broth in quotations because it's thick like ranch so unless you engage in that social media clout chase, it's not broth - it's totally just carbonara.  Great for hangovers (speaking from experience) but just ok on its own culinary merits.",3,7/23/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
880,"Last meal in Boston! Stayed in Charlestown, so this was a great option. We were seated promptly for a Sunday morning. Awesome high top table next the window. Our server, Emmy was friendly & efficient. The good was excellent! Great way to end our trip!",5,7/28/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
881,"My boyfriend got the huevos ranchos for brunch and it was delicious. I got the bacon Benedict. Do not order this dish if you do not like kale. There is ALOt of it. And it was overbearing. Also I ordered toast and they came out with one piece of bread... no butter, no jelly, just one piece and then once the check came I was charged $3 for it!Everything else was good. Very good cocktails",4,7/28/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
882,"Great place in Ctown . Food is always on point and the atmosphere is nice .  Big props on that . However i stopped in for just a glass of wine recently and had a can of seltzer with me i had just bought and the bartender picked it up and said "" should i toss this for you ?""  I replied "" no i just bought it ? "". She then replied "" I'm sorry you can't have outside drinks at the bar "".    I took it back and put it in my bag , affronted .  I could see if i wasn't ordering an almost ten dollar drink , but who the hell is anyone to tell anyone, "" lemme toss the soda you bought bc you're in our establishment?""  Really ?  I had Two drinks and still tipped over 20 percent but that was really untoward. Otherwise I've been happy with monument, the food and atmosphere but slow the roll over drink monitors when you have a Paying customer.  Jeez .",4,8/3/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
883,"Best wings I've never had in Boston! The pizza was just so delicious! You can't go to Charlestown without stopping by Monument Restaurant and Tavern. The day we went we arrived at an hour in between lunch and dinner, unfortunately the Linner doesn't exist yet the same way the Brunch as been created! Ahah.So they did not serve the full menu which was a little disappointing at first -- but when the chicken wings and the pizza arrived we were in the food heaven ! Don't miss it if you decide to spend time in Charlestown!",5,8/3/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
884,"Great 1st experience here.-Andrew at the bar was friendly and on point.-Beer selection was solid!  Had a Fiddlehead IPA and a Whirlpool (Pale) by Nightshift.-Burger was amazing!!!-Smashed potatoes also amazing!  As leftovers-just as good!-GF's Steak was sick!  -Mac was solid.  Not my fav mac in the world but solid 4/5.-The vibe there is cool.  Not a ton of screens-which is good and bad depending on your needs.  I like the space.-Don't come here with a car, take Lyft.  Parking on Maine St can be a pain in the ass.  In a pinch, maybe you can park near the 99 and get away with it but I wouldn't spend too long if you do that.",5,8/6/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
885,Favorite spot in Charlestown. Honesty only been here for brunch but it is always right what I was looking for.  Good Bloody Mary breakfast pizza and always a friendly staff.  I suggest going early because it does get busy after about 10:30. I'll miss this place when I leave the area!,5,8/6/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
886,"Saturday around 5pm, right when dinner menu started, without reservations and as started filling up. Cool modern place, pretty typical for nice new trendy Boston restaurants. Service was good. They've got a long list of alcoholic beverages, including a few ciders, which I'm a fan of. Free bread was great and the butter that came with it was slightly sweet, almost like fig-sweetened. Quite liked it. We started with artichoke dip, which I'm pretty sure was just 4 lbs of melted cheese, but was delicious. I got the burger, which was like a fancy Big Mac - 2 patties and a pinkish sauce that tasted like the Big Mac sauce. Of course, delicious. Fries were thin and crispy, which is my style and I liked it. My cousin got the Cubano, which was good, slightly less flavorful than mine, but quite tasty. His wife got the salmon pad Thai, which sounded wrong to me, but was quite tasty. Overall quite solid.",4,8/18/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
887,I have been here quite a few times.. gave it many chances..both take out and Big party dinners about 4 times..  My husband and i ordered pizza's to go last night and when my husband went to pick them up..The Hostess told my husband she gave his pizza to someone ELSE..ugggh she then walked to kitchen and came back and said too wait they would pop another one in the oven . he waited 15-20 more minutes after all the other waited time..Bottom line he was charged full price after all this???  the pizza was raw and disgusting.. save your money . GO TO FIGS INSTEAD,1,9/2/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
888,"When moving there are several adjustments one makes. Rerouting commutes, where to grocery shop, and take out/eat out spots. Lucky for us that transition was at lot easier after discovering Monument! With kids and without kids Monument is always the answer when cooking is not in the cards. The menu has something for everyone and they keep things interesting by adding special offerings during Taco Tuesdays and Wonton Wednesdays. Almost everything is amazing. I haven't tried the pizzas so can't vouch for those but the following aré no fails: chunky guacamole (love the Tajin dusted chips), carnitas tacos, shaved Brussels sprouts salad, smash burger (one of the kids says that this is THE best burger ever and he has tried many! Lol), brick chicken (the Cauli rice is insane), strip steak, breakfast sandwich, patatas bravas. The kids love the breakfast ramen (kind of tastes like Mac and cheese goodness) and we love there is a kid menu for the younger ones. The space is cool and open. You can't go wrong coming here. If traveling with kids this place is super family friendly and will not disappoint kiddos and grownups alike.",5,9/29/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
889,"This is clearly a very popular spot for brunch on the weekends and it's easy to see why. The vibe of Monument is very laid back but still 'upscale' enough to document on instagram :)We had a reservation, but weren't seated until about 15 minutes after since the group before us was running long. Once they left the table was bussed and set relatively quickly and it was smooth sailing from there. The service was friendly and attentive without being too much, and the food was delicious! I tried the goat cheese omelette which was so fluffy and came with smashed potatoes - also very yummy. The portion was just enough for brunch and didn't weigh me down for the rest of the day which was nice.The only small disappointment was they ran out of juice pretty early in the morning. I wanted to try a blood orange bellini (or any other flavor listed on the menu) but all they had at 11am was orange and grapefruit juice. My drink was still good, just not as fun as I was hoping for.Overall I would return to Monument again!",4,10/11/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
890,"Much better service sitting in the dining room than the bar. The margarita pizza was excellent, thanks!",4,10/12/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
891,"My partner and I both got sandwiches, which barely fit on the table together with water and drinks. I kept thinking I was going to knock something off. This is also one of those places where you will be on top of the table next to you -- so probably not good for a first date (it was not for us, but seemed like it was 2 tables down). We thought the server forgot about us a few times, but maybe they just didn't see our table since they did all look like one. I had the veggie torta which was really good, but a lot of bread. I could have done with more filling. There was also an over abundance of fries, which made me think they were just trying to fill me up on carbs (I was going to a party after so I'm not really upset with that), and, again, I could have gone for more substance.",3,10/16/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
892,"Definition of a 4 Star spot. Great beer selection, nice ambiance, solid menu options... but every time I've gone there's been at least one thing that they didn't get right (cold stale rolls one time, 20 minutes to get the bill another, patatas bravas that were essentially big uncut potatoes). Solid spot, they could be better by tightening things up.",4,10/18/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
893,"Love having this local gem down the street. Food Is nearly always fabulous. Love the rolls with fresh whipped ricotta and the donuts for dessert - yum! Pail of Prosecco for brunch is an awesome addition. Sometimes the mains are merely good - paella last month comes to mind so 4 stars not 5. It is never a quiet place, serving the hip, old  and young families alike. Lovely staff!",4,10/19/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
894,"Muahhhhhhh, perfection! The food was soooooo delicious and the ambiance was great. We had pepperoni pizza, and you could taste the honey drizzle. Mouth watering crab-artichoke dip topped off the night, and that's just the late-night menu. I would most certainly come back here to have dinner.",5,10/29/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
895,"Awesome space, mediocre experience. Apps were solid, Arancini Carbonara and Crab/Artichoke dip with grilled pitas were both tasty. Smash burger and fries was excellent but half of our party had the overpriced $30 short rib entree which was actually beef disguised as the murder weapon. A blackjack of tough chewy flavorless sinew that was so untender you needed a knife to hack it up which is not an optimal short rib quality. It was topped with onion rings in dire need of seasoning over a bland ""creamy"" pasta which was no cheesier than a kraft original dry mix sans the milk and butter...which at least has nostalgia going for it...service was ok though we had a couple of bone dry drink stretches. Bartender before seating was capable but surly. As if our order put him out. All in all I would go back, I think this is a case of digging for what they do well and what they don't. Pizza looked nice and they have a brick oven but it might be months before we even bother.",3,11/1/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
896,"Came here for my first brunch experience in Boston. Arrived around 10 and was surprised to see a mostly empty restaurant, though by 11 it was definitely packed and people were waiting. I can speak from experience that the Croque Madame and apple cinnamon French toast were both delicious. I did not try it but I was told the fried chicken biscuit was also a delight.",5,11/14/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
897,This place was a find! We went and shared the lobster and corn chowder which was de-lic-ious! Ordered the wild mushroom pizza also excellent. Waitstaff was very friendly. Would go again. Keep in mind they do brunch sat and Sunday. A number of the brunch items looked fun.,5,11/16/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
898,"So I decided to come back to give Monument another shot--this time going for brunch, and left happier.I came back and decided to try their brunch menu, although admittedly ate more lunch than anything breakfast related. Unfortunately for my wife, there weren't too many egg free/gluten free options for breakfast foods (usually you'll see a sides option where you can order just bacon, or potatoes--although we did ask for an order of potatoes and they were able to place that for us). Food: Much better than previously. My wife had the carnitas tacos (which she said overall were a bit disappointing due to the pork being a bit dry, although still flavorful and both tacos falling apart while eating them. Maybe it needs two tortillas? The rosemary chicken wings were phenomenal (her favorite part of the meal and we surprised they came with 8), the side of potatoes great and my white pizza was delicious as well. I know this might be me being picky, but for a 2 dollar extra charge, I'd have been even happier if there was a possibility to put prosciutto on the white pizza.Drinks: I stuck with something easier here and it didn't disappoint. The Mexican mule was excellent. Décor/ambience: Packed to the brim on a Sunday mid morning. Can't say enough the place looks great. Really love the ceilings!Service: Overall decent. We did only have napkin/cutlery set at our table when were seated, and it took two reminders before they brought over just the napkin lol. Luckily most of the food could be eaten by hand (wings, tacos, and pizza), and we just shared the fork for the potatoes. It didn't really take away from our experience and it was pretty crowded so I won't judge this too harshly.Overall, will be coming back for the pizza and to try the spicy chili chicken wings.",4,11/21/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
899,"Monument? More like MOMMYment! So many babies my ovaries are hurting and I'm 70+. On another note great ""carnitas tacos"" Not sure what it is but it tasted very innovative.What a nice afternoon in the neighborhood! Thank you Mommy's everywhere!!",4,11/24/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
900,"I've never been disappointment by their brunch. I'm almost scared to come at another time of day because I don't want to break the spell. Making reservations is easy and it doesn't take 3+ weeks of forethought, like other places in Boston. Even when I wanted a last-minute table for Father's Day, they were able to deliver. They've never had us wait for our reservation and service is always warm and attentive. But most importantly -- the food. It's never missed the mark. I've had wildly different things (savory vs. sweet, breakfast vs. lunch) and have always been impressed. Get pancakes for the table. You won't regret it!",5,12/12/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
901,"Experienced the best breakfast/brunch in Charlestown this morning.  If you are visiting or live in Boston make your way to Charlestown and visit Monument Restaurant and Tavern.  Exceptional menu for both breakfast and brunch featuring distinctive dishes, including pancakes(both lemon/poppy and blueberry) made today's breakfast choices.  Scanning the menu we saw a Breakfast Pizza, breakfast angus steak burritos, fried chicken biscuit, pastramI reuben hash...all patron favorites.  Weekend Brunch served from 9am to 3pm.  Great food, great service, Monument Restaurant stands out in the city of Boston.",5,12/28/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
902,A fantastic place within Charlestown with a very eclectic menu that borders on Spanish/American with a southeastern flare.  This place does get packed on the weekends so your best bet is likely grabbing a high top by the bar if you don't have a reservation.  They have a great beer and cocktail selection and the food is definitely top notch.  One great thing they do is a half fries half salad mix for sandwiches which I haven't seen in a lot of other places.  Highly recommend for anyone looking for a casual night out in Boston/Charlestown.,5,12/29/2019,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
903,"Small menu until 5pm, a couple apps and pizza.  We tried the margherita pizza.  Good sauce and great crust.  We also tried the salmon pad thai and the brick chicken.  I loved the salmon dish with noodles and he loved the brick chicken.  Really liked the ambiance here.  Nice lighting, you can see what you're doing but still has low lighting.  Exposed wood and the booth seating is great, comfortable and street side.  Drinks were good.  Our waitress was very efficient and friendly.  Must have filled my water 5 times.  Kid friendly too! ...but didn't see a kid menu.  Lots of families and it's not quiet in there so you can bring your toddler without interrupting anyone else's dinner.",5,1/5/2020,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
904,"Monument is where I take all my friends visiting for brunch in Boston. It has a great ambiance and never disappoints. It has a great variety but also has very tasty food. The Brussels sprout salad is great, avocado toast, steak burrito or French toast. I've honestly never had a bad meal here. They also make their own Bloody Mary mix which is amazing. I only come for brunch because at night has more of a family vibe which I am not for yet. 100% recommended for brunch! Oh also great prices",5,1/5/2020,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

The drinks were awesome and priced fairly, the service was quick and Courteous.

909,"We've been to Monument twice since they opened up their patio. The food, drinks, and service were exactly what we've come to expect from them. What I loved with these recent visits it's how seriously they are taking the heath precautions for COVID. Check in is outside and they do a good job keeping people from congregating there. The food pick up got moved further inside to separate the two stands. Hand sanitizer at the front, took our number for contract tracing, QR code scanner, and easy check out from our phone. Monument was already a favorite - we go there more than any other restaurant around. Their commitment to safety makes us even happier to support the restaurant and the staff. Food & drink: - Lobster & corn fritters are amazing. Sauce is great. - My wife got the Salmon Pad Thai. It's her favorite there - massive portion. Perfectly cooked fish. Always some noodles to take home.  - I got the scallops for the first time. Again, perfectly cooked. Risotto was deliciousThank you Monument! Glad y'all are back in action!",5,7/4/2020,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

911,"This is the first restaurant I've been to for indoor dining since phase 4 of CoVID has allowed us to. (If you're reading this in 10 years kids, don't ask us about the C word. We WILL cry!). I was nervous at first about indoor dining, but it was such a pleasant experience. The waitress had a face shield on, which made me feel extra protected. The tables were well spaced apart, menus were digital, they just seemed to ensure cleanliness. The menu has delicious and unique drinks like cereal milk cocktails. My fave is the watermelon crush cocktail on a sunny summer day! As for the brunch foods, we were disappointed because all the savory items have some kind of pork in the breakfast menu, unless you get an appetizer or sandwich. We don't eat pork so it was limited to basically French toast, pancakes. Omelette and other main dishes had pork in sausage form. Fortunately one chorizo dish was kindly substituted with steak for us, but most dishes were not able to be modified for non-pork consumers. The French toast and huevos rancheros (with steak) was delicious! I just hope they are able to accommodate other diets in the future.Ultimately, it was a great experience with delicious food. They did pretty well adjusting to the circumstances of CoVID. Highly recommend!",5,8/2/2020,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

Our party made reservations online ahead of time and while they don't explicitly reserve outdoor seating we called ahead and was able to score a table outside. We had a reservation for 12:15 and they were running a little behind but the waitress was so sweet and brought us all some waters while we waited for the table sitting to finish up. Everyone followed COVID protocol and everything was super sanitary. The meals were delicious and came out super quickly. I went with the Salmon Lox Bagel and others at the table enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros, Chicken Sandwich, and Bacon Benedict.

When we arrived we had a small wait, but were greeted with friendly service and waters (it was really hot out!). Once we were seated, the service was attentive and helpful. The menu is fairly large, and about 10 items sounded equally amazing to me. We all had difficulty deciding our dishes but landed on: bacon eggs benedict, lox bagel, nashville hot chicken, and huevos rancheros. To cut to the chase, they were all delicious! Special shout out to the hot chicken sandwich, it came with a whole mess of crispy fries and a salad. In terms of COVID, they cover all the bases (masks, wiped down tables, outdoor dining options, spacious) while still maintaining a normal dining experience. All in all, I highly recommend Monument Restaurant for a late-morning meal, it was a *brunch* of fun!",4,8/11/2020,Monument Restaurant & Tavern

The pizza was alright, not as fresh as I had hoped and a bit to charred in the bottom. Delivery was pretty quick so I don't think it was a case of delivery issues. Would still be worth to give them a try when things go back to normal...",3,9/5/2020,Monument Restaurant & Tavern
921,Constantly impressed by the food and service here. The best pizza around. We love the Hawaiian and the white pizza. The patatas bravas are absolutely delicious. The short rib is a must try also.

The honey and goat cheese pizza was good, but the burger I got was terrible. Gross 'secret sauce' on it and the meat had no flavor. My friends agreed their meals weren't great either.It's possible I'm the dumb one for this: I tried to salvage the burger by scraping off the sauce and adding ketchup and what I thought was mustard. But it turns out the yellow and black-speckled sauce they had on the plate (by the burger, next to the ketchup) was not mustard, but garlic butter. =/I might go back for a beer, but I think I'll steer clear of the food until they've better figured things out.",3,1/1/2017,City Tap House
931,"Went to city tap today for there first brunch... my waiter was very attentive and helpful with answering any questions on the menu. I got the beer mimosa and it was amazing!! My new favorite drink, I highly recommend you try it. For food I got an egg breakfast dish and it was delicious. My new favorite spot can't wait to go again!!!",5,1/1/2017,City Tap House
932,"Great food and service, awesome atmosphere! I strongly recommended city tap house to anyone who likes having a great time!",5,1/2/2017,City Tap House
933,"Went during the first few days of opening.  Thought the food was great, staff was attentive and on their game.  Beer selection is the best in the area.  They have done an amazing job with the space; the restaurant is inviting and very well decorated.  Will be back again soon.",5,1/3/2017,City Tap House
934,"My wife and I decided at the last minute to celebrate the New Year in Boston. Since we were staying in the Seaport District we decided to check out the City Tap House which had just opened up days before and we are very happy we did. Our dinner reservations were for 8:00 PM and were were seated immediately. The restaurant has a great vibe to it. Very open concept but with a clearly defined bar and seating area. Plenty of TVs for viewing the Bruins, Patriots, etc. without the TVs taking over the bar. Well thought out layout and very comfortable. As the name suggests if you like a wide variety of beer on tap this is the place to go. Our server was great and the food was excellent. My wife and I split the Buratta appetizer. We were unsure as to whether or not to order it, however, the waiter highly recommended it and he was right. It was outstanding. As to our entree, my wife ordered the mushroom and truffle oil pizza. Again, perfect amount of truffle oil. Enough to give you the truffle flavor without overwhelming the pizza. I ordered the double cut pork chop and it was thick, juicy, and cooked perfectly. Overall, great atmosphere, great location, and great food. Well worth the trip.",5,1/3/2017,City Tap House
935,"I work in Fort Point and with so many great places in the neighborhood I didn't realize that a place like City Tap was missing till I went there. The beer selection is fantastic (as you would expect with their name)  And the food was great.. (Was eating the Brussels sprouts with the serving spoon...though that might say more about me than it does the sprouts, but they were SO good!).  Also had the pizza and it was terrific.  Everything about the place is warm and inviting...including the staff...you could tell they liked being there also.  My friend's sister was drinking a cocktail called Whitehead (I think) and though she claimed to not like the name she was certainly enjoying them!  Said they were ridiculously good. City Tap House is a great addition to Seaport/Fort Point. Highly recommend the place.",5,1/3/2017,City Tap House
936,"First time was a charm! The newly opened restaurant has an impressive amount of taps (60) and also includes an attractive selection of scotches/Whiskeys. The place is very warm and welcoming and has a blend of modern industrial meets cozy tavern. It was immediately comfortable upon entering. Immediately connected with our wait person Caitlyn, who gave us just the right amount of attention.  She allowed us to take our time but was always there to tend to our needs.We started by sampling several beers from their extensive list. I started with the Raging Bitch IPA, which I felt suited my personality well.  My first time trying it and I would definitely get it again.  It was refreshing with a nice hoppy finish. Several more beers were sampled but suffice to say, there are an abundant amount of options for beer lovers of all styles.Our first food selections were appetizers, the curry mussels and the sriracha cauliflower was just perfect.  the Cauliflower was just the slightest bit crunchy under the creamy sriracha sauce. I had a hard time sharing this dish!   The mussels were also cooked to perfection.  They melted in your mouth and the curry broth could easily have been served as a soup menu item.Main courses we chose the Tartufo pizza was almost too much.  Almost.  It is rich and creamy and smothered in roasted portobello mushrooms.  Crust was just bubbly, crunchy and chewy the way a good pizza should be.  My partner had the Rib Eye which he requested rare.  It was cooked to the correct color of pink and plenty of juice.  It was served with shoestring potatoes which, while hot were delicious but when cool, taste more like potato sticks.  Not that this is a bad thing, just an observation.   We tried the Pots de creme for dessert which was not terribly sweet, to my liking and was a lovely texture.After dinner we took to the bar for a final cocktail and had some of the best bar servers. Melissa was friendly and very helpful about the cocktail options.My only critique might be that the menu is heavy on the meats and since I do not eat beef or port, it leaves few options but still the options were perfectly presented and flavored. It won't stop me from returning and I could really make this my ""go-to"" place.Congratulations City Tap House and Welcome to Boston!",5,1/4/2017,City Tap House
937,"Went for a closed off event that was open bar and horderves. Awesome food and their menu has variety. I loved the Korean tacos, tuna sticks, and crab balls. Boston usually slacks when it comes to brunch, but this place has it from 11-3. Very excited to come back to this place.",5,1/6/2017,City Tap House
938,"This place was great. The first thing I noticed was the beer menu, it's massive. They have a beer for anybody and every body. There are 60 beers on draft which is impressive! There is also an extensive bourbon, whiskey, and scotch menu.The service was great. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable. The manager Kurt was very hospitable. I had their Margherita Pizza and the Tap Burger. The Tap Burger was amazing and the pizza crust was very good.The bar area is very nice and has plenty of TVs which will be great for watching games. The music was really good and helped give the bar a good vibe. They played a mix of everything. It went beyond the boring top 40 or elevator music.I will definitely be returning. Fyi... the parking isn't the best due to the location.",5,1/8/2017,City Tap House
939,"Great addition to the Boston restaurant and bar scene. I went there on a Monday night for a drink and appetizer to try it out and upon entering it has a great ambience. The wooden beams from the original building was a nice touch. The bartender concocted a tasty drink based on my tastes while my partner had one of the best Manhattan's he's had before due to the wide variety of whiskey's (100+) they have to offer. We had the Israeli Hummus appetizer and it was delicious. We will definitely be back based on the tap menu and food menu (can't wait to try to the blue crab mac&cheese). And the beverage manager, Greg, was very pleasant to chat with as he went around to customers to mingle and make sure everyone was enjoying their experience. A great personal touch as they are just newly opened. Will be back!",5,1/10/2017,City Tap House
940,Just went for first time last night. Great wings and pizza. I was there for a work event so I can only speak for the apps. I would definitely come back for dinner and brunch menu looks appetizing.,5,1/12/2017,City Tap House
941,Seriously had the best experience! I went for an event. The staff is great especially Tiffany behind the bar! She knows how to mix a great drink and she's extremely friendly! The management made it a point to come over and make sure we were enjoying our experience! A++! I recommend to all to check this spot out!,5,1/12/2017,City Tap House
942,"Let's start with bad. Came here for brunch and get sat asap, unfortunately no server came to greet us for about 10-15 mins. I'm pretty sure we were forgotten about until the manager came over with water and informed us a server was coming. Got the chicken and waffles and the chicken was burnt.Now the good: the restaurant is very spacious and they have a wide selection of liquor. The pulled pork nachos was delicious (highly recommend as a starter). And the chicken waffles (when it wasn't burnt)...was interesting. Eaten individually the chicken was very bland, but combined with the waffle, whip cream, syrup, and jam; it became super good. Also the way the restaurant handled my burnt food was very well. Gave me another one, apologized, and taken off our bill.They're still new so I ain't gonna get petty with my review, and I understand these things happen. 4 stars.",4,1/14/2017,City Tap House
943,"Heard about this new restaurant and thought we'd give it a try.  Great selection of craft beers on tap which were grouped by types on the separate beer menu - pale ales, wheat, bitter , etc.  The food menu offered a variety of choices and everything we tried -starters and entrees - were tasty.  There was a great buzz of energy from both the customers and staff who were very attentive.  Overall seems like a great place to meet friends to watch a game on the multiple TV's or just have dinner with a great selection of craft beers.  Parking lot right across the street is very convenient so no time wasted looking for a place to park. Will definitely be going back.",5,1/15/2017,City Tap House
944,"This restaurant has a large, rustic space with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Coming right after work, the spot was filled with people popping by for after work drinks. The bar was packed! The set up does a nice job of separating the bar and seating area so you can still have a more intimate dinner. I noticed there was also another room that would be perfect for a large private function. Come here with an appetite! My friend and I split the Brussels sprouts, Abigail mussels, and flatbread pizza with generous leftovers. The Brussels sprouts where perfectly grilled with pomegranate seeds. I also loved the Abigail mussels that were drenched in butter. There was just enough garlic to add some flavor without overdoing it. Can't wait to come back!",5,1/15/2017,City Tap House
945,What a great addition to the already great restaurants in Seaport! Super impressed with the brunch and how accommodating they were with making awesome brunch drinks by the carafe! The Gluten Friendly menu was a hit with the GF too! Ohhh make reservations though this place is hot right now!,5,1/15/2017,City Tap House
946,"I came here for an event so keep this in mind, but either way the food and staff were amazing. I tried a mini version of their sliders and the meat was amazing quality. It also included their special sauce which is sort of like a 1000 island sauce and delicious!My favorite was their pimento cheese and biscuits. It was everything I wanted. Delicious biscuits and cheese with a little kick. Another huge favorite was their crab and corn hush puppies. Like omg. Let me repeat, crab and corn hush puppies!! So good. Their taretare, tacos, and shrimp and grits were winners too. Also worth mentioning is that they had this cool version of a mule that uses ginger infused kombucha which was a huge hit of the night, and I dont even like kombucha. I believe it was called something like the wolf and the mule. The staff was also extremely friendly and helpful. The bar manager personally came over and spoke with us and the manager, Shannon, was very eager to answer any questions I had about the menu!",5,1/15/2017,City Tap House
947,"We were very excited to try the ""Hot & New"" spot whcih is right around the corner from our hotel and a place that our adult children working in Boston were anxious to try. The place is VERY loud.  We had a party of 6 for my husband's birthday. My Son arrived first and they showed him to a booth. NO WAY 6 people fitting in the booth.  The place is new - so I am being easy on them.  I am an avid Yelper and we are frequent travelers so we are out ALOT.  We travel to Boston, New York, Miami and Naples on a regular basis. We were there on a Friday night and the bar was PACKED and loud.  The deocr was pleasnat and the location was great for us. Easy for my daughter who lives in the North End and my son who lives in Southie to get to.The food was ok -we have the wings, rice balls for apps and we all had cocktails.  Everyone had 2 drinks except me.  My husband and I shared a salad and pizza, my daughter and her fiance did the same. My son and his girlfriend had a pizza and each had a salad.  They brought a dessert for my husband for his birthday.  The food was good.The bad news - it cost almost $300 with tip for the 6 of us for pizza, salad and cocktails. They charged us for the ""birthday dessert"" and an extra cocktail - which I didn't notice on the bill until I got home. It should have been 11 drinks - I had one. They charged us for 12 (at $15.00 a drink and an up charge for Grey Goose A $300 bill and they didn't through in a piece of cake? $$$ is accurate.",3,1/17/2017,City Tap House
948,"A very welcomed addition to the Seaport/Fort Point area. Easily a top three beer list in all of Boston. Also, multiple large screen TVs makes for a great place to watch a game. If someone hadn't informed me, I would have no clue this place is a chain. Shared a bunch of apps, such as the pulled pork nachos and sriracha cauliflower, which were very good. The star of the show was one of the pizzas we got, which had truffles, mushroom, egg, and taleggio. This was easily some of the best pizza I've ever had.I can see myself spending a lot of money here, as I will be back over and over again. I am excited for when their taps rotate again, and hope that they add more to the sour section.",5,1/17/2017,City Tap House
949,"The atmosphere was great. The crab Mac and cheese was to die for, a must have. I had the rib eye, which was cooked perfectly, and the ricotta fritters were a delish ending to dinner. Also give the southie shake a try! City Tap is a really good addition to the fort point/ seaport restaurant scene. Can't wait to go again.",5,1/17/2017,City Tap House
950,"This is a great addition to the seaport! I came the first official weekend of being open, and they were packed! The bar area was overwhelming, but I had a dinner reservation and that area was much more manageable crowd wise. Service was fantastic, this is a huge thing for me, and City Tap was top notch. Our waitress was attentive and even the managers stopped by to check in on us. Drinks were good, not huge but they were strong. We had the Brussel sprouts (A MUST TRY), the mussels, and a pizza. All were delicious!I will definatly be back to try this place again!",5,1/18/2017,City Tap House
951,"This place is a great spot and I'm happy it's open! I have actually been twice now since it had opened. My first experience was brunch on New Years Day. It was pretty good but we certainly had some mishaps on things that we ordered. For day 2 of it being open I wasn't turned off and I recently went back with some coworkers for after work drinks and appetizers. We tried the charred brussel sprouts, the hummus, the fig & prosciutto pizza, and the 10 spice wings. All of those appetizers did not disappoint, they were great! I'll be back as a regular customer.",4,1/21/2017,City Tap House
952,"SO HAPPY BOSTON HAS ONE! This place was located next to my college campus, and my friend mentioned them opening in Seaport! We went for drinks and some appetizer on a Friday night and it was THE place to BE! There was a great crowd- with plenty of room at the bar so you didn't feel like you were fighting for space or climbing over someone for a drink. Beer selection is always impressive--wow! Close to anything under the sun you can think of an most likely on tap, even my all time favorite summer beer which is hard to find dead middle of winter.Had the 'corn and crab  hush-puppies' and 'maplebrook farms burrata'. On point! All of it. The hush-puppies were perfectly golden crispy on the outside with the light fluffiness on the inside, and the crap adds that wonderful Boston undertone we all have come to enjoy....and don't forget to dip them in that sauce! The burrata will become my new go-to appetizer as I'm a huge prosciutto fan and this did not disappoint. Just the right size and flavorful in itself. The bartenders were friendly and attentive and overall the staff was helpful which is a major kudos considering the crowd that was there. All in all we had a great time, we enjoyed some great beers and tasty food and will be making this our go-to spot!",5,1/24/2017,City Tap House
953,"Overall, the food was very good! A friend and I shared a few items. We started with the hush puppies, which were delicious. We also got the Panang mussels with fries. The coconut milk broth was very good and I would definitely get them again. However, the fries weren't the best. They were on the soggy side. We finished with the prosciutto and fig pizza. It's hard to mess up anything with fig in my book. I normally prefer a crispier crust, but I really enjoyed the softness of the crust and thought it was delicious! I'll definitely be back to try some of the items on their daily specials list.My only complaint was the service, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt that it was a one time thing. It took 15 minutes from the time we sat down for someone to fill our water glasses and took 30 minutes until a waitress came over. She did apologize saying there was a mix up on server sections. The service afterwards was fine.",4,1/25/2017,City Tap House
954,"The food was pretty good, pretty much what you would expect in the Seaport..Mac n cheese and over spiced wings.. The service was awesome though..Elizabeth took such great care of us, made us feel at home & had some great recommendations for beer/wine. I would definitely go back..She made our night!",4,1/28/2017,City Tap House
955,"Went in on a Friday night and was able to get a reservation for 2 for dinner quite easily. The staff is super friendly and engaging, from the hostess to the waitstaff. Service was fast and never had to ask for a refill on drinks. Definitely try the Wolf & the Mule, very tasty drink! The Burrata and their pretzel were great and the salumi pizza was super spicy. Had a great time and will definitely return!",5,1/29/2017,City Tap House
956,"Came here on a Sunday around 5 because the pics on yelp look really good! What I wanted the most was chicken and waffles but they only serve that on Tuesdays or brunch womp. Hostess was normal no wait so that was good, waiter was a cool easy going guy. They had a mixed crowd between hip adults, families, and college kids watching the game. The menu optioms weren't that exciting to me but perhaps I will try back on a Tuesday or weekend brunch. My bf ordered the 10 spice wings, I ordered maple porkchop. It was good , I liked the salad and sweet potatoPurée the most added great flavor. The manager came to the table at the end of our meal and asked how everything was , & he wasn't asking just to ask, it seemed like he genuinely cared which is good to see in any food establishment . Id come back ... Just on a Tuesday instead",4,1/29/2017,City Tap House
957,"This place is pretty cool and amazing that they just opened on New year's Eve. Our waiter paid attention to us, checked up on us without being overbearing, and told us about his life. The food was phenomenal. The ""big chick"" was filling and rich. Great gravy, seasoned chicken and homemade biscuits. It came with home fries which were underseasoned and kinda burned but it didn't matter to me much because the main food was great. The beer was good and they have a very wide selection. I will be back!",4,1/30/2017,City Tap House
958,"I have only been here once. My coworkers and I had a really bad experience with a bartender where he rung up our orders on the wrong cards, cashed out tabs we asked to keep open, got snippy with us about his OWN mistake, refused to hand me a menu for the ladies standing behind me, etc. He was rude and just an all around miserable man-bun disaster. Now....that said, I asked to speak to a manager and I was introduced to Kurt. He was professional and apologetic. Offered a refund, but I refused. The main thing was that Kurt wanted to make it right and was willing to listen to us about what we had just experienced. He was kind, courteous, and quite honestly it made up for the one turd of a bartender we had. I'm SURE the other staff were all pleasant and excited about working in this new, beautiful location in South Boston in the Fort Point area. This place is beautifully decorated and set up. Very cozy and really cool lighting, They even had multiple sours (my favorite) and a great beer selection. I would definitely recommend and I would definitely come back here.",4,1/31/2017,City Tap House

960,Best chicken and waffles (brunch) in Boston!!! A must try!! Also had the burger (dinner) and it was delicious. Will be coming back again.,5,2/4/2017,City Tap House
961,"This place is great! I went for brunch and will definitely be back. The beermosa (beer, elderflower liqueur, champagne & OJ) is incredible - I wish they sold it by the pitcher. I ordered the Hangover pizza (breakfast pizza with egg, cheese, sausage gravy) and it was soooo good. Also got the Big Chick which was to die for - the bacon is smokey perfection & the home fries come with perfectly caramelized onions that will make your mouth water! Service was great, food was even better, and the atmosphere was cozy & cute. I will be back for brunch & to grab drinks with friends!",5,2/6/2017,City Tap House
962,"The beer list is extensive and fairly priced for the selection, but everything else is okay. I know that sounds obvious with ""tap house"" in the name, just wanted to throw it out there. Ordered the 10-spice wings, foie gras, chicken and waffles. I found the portion of bread for the foie gras to be light since it is a hearty app, I would pass on the wings at the $14 price point. my friend enjoyed her brunch, so I can't comment on that. decided to leave after we finished our bites/drinks. the bar area has communal tables with foot rests and HD tvs. the resaurant side has plenty of seating, they take reservations for major sports events like the Super Bowl. the game is on a projection screen.",3,2/7/2017,City Tap House

965,"Great food, great drinks, and great service...what more could you want?Daily from 5-7 they have a selection of apps on their happy hour menu that are fantastic. I went with a group of friends and we ordered 1 of each. I highly recommend the pate and hummus dishes. They are all big enough to share as well which was a nice surprise. The amount of beer they have on draft is impressive and while the bar can be packed there are always waiters walking around taking drink orders throughout the night so you will never have to wait too long to obtain some alcohol.",5,2/13/2017,City Tap House
966,"Beer and bar service are both good to great - Food has underwhelmed me my first few times here.  Most recently, roasted beets not as listed on menu and were just average.  Fries were soggy and barely warm.  People to the right and left of me had pizza and nachos and they said it was decent but would not order again.Hope the food improves - the beer brings em in, but the food would get em to stay",3,2/13/2017,City Tap House

969,"This place had a really cool vibe - sort of like an upscale Bugaboo Creek or Applebee's... located in in an odd part of the City of Boston/Seaport/Southie it's a little bit hard to find but the vibe was good. The good:+GREAT service. Excellent server; even comped our pizza b/c my 2 friends had their lips on fire from the peppers on it! +apps were good - liked the beets a lot and the babagonoush was very good+cozy vibe, good spot for singles probably?The bad:-menu can't decide wtf it wants to be... Mediterranean? Bar Food? Burgers and pizza? Salads and seafood? totally confusing menu-not that good food generally. Didn't love the avo grapefruit salad - shrimp was kinda raw and I even had to send it back. Also, the dressing was wayyyyyyyyyyyy too much- do you want some arugula with that salad dressing?Great HARD cider menu and beer listings - would come back for sure and try their lunch maybe but nothing too great compared to the other places in the area.",3,2/15/2017,City Tap House
970,"Got into late and this place was walking distance from our hotel. As total beer nerds it was absolutely awesome! A tap list with a bunch of variety and a big menu with nice selection. We weren't too hungry so just did small plates: baba ghanoush, burrata, and crab hush puppies. All three were great I would have a really hard time picking a favorite, maybe the burrata because it came with these really interesting mashed peas. Cheers Boston peeps, this place is great wish NYC had one",5,2/17/2017,City Tap House
971,"I'd love to actually write a review about the food, but the hostess was not able to seat a party of two at 4:10p on a Sunday afternoon, despite plenty of empty tables, because they were awaiting shift change at 5p. The bar was full, so we went to another restaurant that was able to seat us. Definitely put a sour taste in my mouth about giving this place a try.",1,2/19/2017,City Tap House

973,"Heard a lot of good things so decided to check it out last weekend. The bar area was stacked 3 people deep, we were fortunate to get a table in the dining room without a reservation. Food was good, but not as great as some of the reviews indicate, essentially it's better than average high end pub food. Great draft beer selection, service was excellent. A solid 4 stars",4,2/20/2017,City Tap House
974,"Really solid spot.  This neighborhood has been in dire need of a full-on craft beer spot, and City Tap fills that niche.  The tap list is fantastic and worth digging through to explore.  Prices are about what you'd expect for a new craft beer spot, so don't be surprised if the bev you're most interested in hovers around $8.  There are still some slightly cheaper options if you're going for quantity over quality.  My one wish is that they'd devoted more of the space to the bar and high-top area - the bar can get very crowded on even a weekday evening.  They do have a patio area that should be opening up once the weather gets nice, and I'm looking forward to that.",4,2/21/2017,City Tap House
975,"Went here with my wife on a Friday night for dinner and had a great experience. The seafood special was fantastic and the Shrimp and Grits were delicious. I had a flight of beers from their incredible tap list and was blown away. The service was outstanding.

976,"I went out for dinner on Valentine's Day with one of my girlfriends and we had an amazing dinner!! They have 60 beers on tap and a rotating selection. The specials that night were incredible - $35 for a delicious Filet!! And I would definitely recommend the Blue Crab Mac&Cheese. Great atmosphere, awesome waiter and the manager stopped by to check on things as well. Overall we felt like we were taken care of very well and our meal was delicious. We definitely spent a pretty penny but it was worth it!",5,2/22/2017,City Tap House
977,"Food:I tried the salumi pizza and the nachos.  The nachos were phenomenal.  Among the best I've had in boston.  The pizza was surprisingly really good as well.  In all I have to say their food was very very good, the only thing that was tough is how narrow the menu was.  They are definitely going for an upscale pub vibe but I thought their food got a little off track and strayed from the upscale basics you would expect at this type of place.Beer:Awesome beer list.  Great variety of all types of beer.Setting:Cool vibe.  Upscale sports bar setting.  I did find the TV situation kind of tough.  A lot of seats dont have the best view of a tv if your actually planning on focusing on a game (and dont want to sit at the bar).  To be fair it was quite busy both times I have gone so perhaps I was just late on finding a spot with a good view.Conclusion:Great food, cool setting, and a welcome addition to the seaport/fort point area.  It would be great to have a few more standard american food options done really well on their menu as opposed to ""chicken paillard"" ""duck confit"" and ""grilled bronzino"" but what they did have was very good.",4,2/22/2017,City Tap House
978,"The food was mostly great - We had the burrata, sriracha cauliflower, brussels sprouts, beets, Verona mussels, grapefruit and avocado salad. The burrata, cauliflower and brussels sprouts were excellent - would definitely get these again. The beets were also very good, but the dish was simple with not a lot to it. The salad was only meh - maybe because we didn't get a protein with it - it just seemed like a plate full of arugula with a few pieces of grapefruit and avocado thrown on top. And the mussels were not my favorite. The broth wasn't very flavorful and the mussels did not taste as fresh as I'd have liked.  For dessert we had the apple crisp and the chocolate creme pot. both were good, but the apple crisp was definitely the favorite. Can't speak for the beer list but the wine selection was good, though a little pricey - nothing under $45 a bottle, with most hovering around $60-70. The space is very cool, with a separate bar and dining area, as well as a small room in back for private functions. My only complaint is the noise level. It wasn't exceptionally crowded in there, but it was so loud we had to shout in order to hear one another.",4,2/23/2017,City Tap House
979,"Great food and great service. On our impromptu trip to Boston, we had no idea where to go. Our trolley driver Michaelangelo recommended the City Tap. We really enjoyed the French dip and the wings (probably best I ever had and we live close to NYC) . Will be returning if we're in Boston again! The only con I would say was that my son had a small bowl of literally noodles and butter and they charge $10 for that.  I guess you pay for location though.",4,2/24/2017,City Tap House
980,"While the inside of the restaurant looks really pretty, they skimped on the acoustics to make this a tolerable sounding location and painful to be in if you want to hear your friends or order a drink or be able to think. Low ceilings with lots of wood make for a painful bar experience on a Friday night. Also, they have some work to do with ordering beer on tap. The Top 3 IPAs were sold out by 5:30 on a Friday night.Hopefully, once they get their outdoor patio permit, they will allow the bar to spill out onto the outside patio which will transform this place into a 5-Star drinking establishment. Sadly, i expect it will all be reserved seating and it will not be a fun place to grab a drink and talk to friends.",2,2/28/2017,City Tap House
981,"My friends and I came here to celebrate my partner's new job. I'll say right off the bat, the only downside to the experience was that we were sat right beside the men's room, and the high traffic killed the vibe a little. However, everything else about the experience was a strong A+ for all of us. Our server, Patrick, was super friendly without getting the weird ""I'm a dude serving a tableful of ladies!"" attitude that is so unfortunately prevalent in servers. He knew everything about the menu, didn't pressure us either to make up our minds or to order more stuff, and was just generally a delight. We started with drinks (they have a cocktail menu as well as a bartender that knows all the classics) and the pulled pork nachos, which were indescribably tasty (what's in that cheese sauce anyway?). Then, dinner. Oh, dinner. This was one of those great nights where everyone ordered the thing that was perfect for them-- we barely even shared tastes around the table, we were so in love. I had the panang mussels with fries-- which is a generous portion even for an entree-- and the broth was so good I had to hold back from drinking it straight from the bowl. My partner had shrimp and grits, bestie had duck fried rice, her partner had the chicken and waffles special, and our friend got the margherita pizza. For a solid ten minutes we barely spoke, we were so involved in our food. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention their extensive drink menu-- a several-pages-long list of beers and ciders; a great cocktail menu and, as mentioned, the full bar; and a huge list of whiskey, bourbon, and scotch offerings if you like a sipping spirit. Overall this is firmly in the three-dollar-sign category for me, but worth it. The menu was great, the service was great, we will definitely be back.",5,3/1/2017,City Tap House
982,Probably 3.5 stars but I'm hoping with a few months it will find a groove like other city locations. Lively on a nice Sunday night but was able to grab bar seats within half an hour. Beer selection is fantastic. Brussels sprouts were so so delicious. Service on my end of the bar was a bit lacking-unattentive and a little unprofessional- but I saw the other bartender was the opposite so it could have easily been the other way around. Patio looks awesome and I'll definitely be back to check it out again and update review.,3,3/2/2017,City Tap House
983,"This place just opened in seaport I was a little skeptical thinking it was just a beer place since I don't drink beer but at my surprised this place has awesome food. Oh man. The chicken and waffle is awesome. The nachos oh la la. And the eggs are delicious. I was pretty surprised and knowing that Boston doesn't have a lot of good restaurants (that I love) this one became one of my favorite brunch place. Waitress was nice and helpful.For beer lovers, they have a wiiiiiiide selections of beers that I'm sure you'll enjoy. I would definitely go back there",5,3/3/2017,City Tap House
984,"Came here for brunch... everything was really good. Biscuits a little dry. But besides that we enjoyed our food. Service was ok. Didn't check on us during our meal but after she did and gave some recommendations of where to go after.I ordered cava and they were out, instead of asking what I wanted the server just ordered me prosecco. I would rather make that decision for myself as to what i am drinking. Thick chic was great and the brewers breakfast was also great.",4,3/5/2017,City Tap House
985,"Lots of places brag about their ""beer selection"". Unfortunately, not too many places get it right. City Tap House gets it right! You see, having 15 taps doesn't make it a ""great beer selection"" if 12 of them are IPAs, dig? Give us some variety! We stopped into City Tap House before hitting the trade center for the golf expo this past week and we really enjoyed it. Bartenders were super friendly and attentive...food was yummy....and they have a GREAT selection of beers, all listed BY BREW STYLE on the menu. I really wish more places would do it that way. They have several of each style (what a novel concept!), so it makes navigating your beer adventure easier and more fulfilling. Check this place out!",5,3/6/2017,City Tap House
986,"I was excited to try City Tap House - we decided to give it a try for brunch. The food was great, the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was lively. I'm sure this is an awesome spot to catch games. And I'm sure it will be a popular spot for the summer months. Excited to go back for dinner!",4,3/13/2017,City Tap House
987,"This rating is solely based on experience in the bar area.I have been to City Tap House twice- once for late night drinks and most recently during Sunday brunch hours. Brunch was much busier as there was a wait for tables as well as the bar high tops and bar area- that being said, we were able to get served at the bar with short wait time. Beer selection: As someone who likes to try new beers, I appreciate what City Tap House has to offer. I am impressed by the extensive beer selection both on draft and in bottles/cans. I love how you can make your own sampler (4 beers) from beers across the menu to get a little bit of everything. They have run out of beers before but unlike other restaurants, I find a reliable alternative. The price point is also very fair, especially in the Fort Point area---if a beer lover, I suggest coming here. Food: Their pulled pork nachos are delicious! As someone who loves nachos, I was impressed by the unique ingredient selection, the serving size and that no chip was left dry- you got what you paid for. The liquid like cheese and pulled pork were balanced out by the spicy peppers on top. Each chip had a great bite. I was also impressed by their fries and truffle aioli- I wish the serving size was bigger but as a side, I understand. Unfortunately, this is where my food review ends. I am intrigued by a few other items on the City Tap menu especially the pizza or to share items with other. That being said, the person who I was with is more selective with his eating and would rate the menu as ""tough"". If you are unsure of unique flavor combinations, you may think that City Tap takes a menu item and has it go one step too far. This is just from reading the menu however and not from actually trying- others seemed to be impressed by their meals and I would be willing to try a few things out upon another visit from other ratings and table appeal.Service: We sat at the bar and it was a very busy brunch hour. Our bartender seemed to be very frazzled and it took awhile to even get a drink order in. I rate the beer selection highly but was not impressed by the Bloody Mary she made. Our fries were forgotten about but when brought to the attention of another server, we received within minutes. I would say besides our direct bartender, the service was great- our water was always filled, food came out fast and from a friendly server and other bartenders were willing to step in to serve us. Overall, I think this a great addition to the Fort Point area- good to watch games, more casual than other restaurant options in the area, fun to try new beers and I am excited to experience the patio as the weather gets warmer. The decor is very cool and the restaurant is quite spacious. I will 100% be back.",4,3/14/2017,City Tap House
988,"Catching up on my reviews:Great place. It had  opened about a week before when we went.We popped in after the car show at the convention center without a reservation.There was a Patriots game that night and the bar was already filling up and hopping.We asked for a table, but given it was a Patriots playoff game, all the tables had reservation associated with them according to the hostess.It was two hours to game time so I asked could we get a table for just an hour and offered  to pinky swear that we would be done in an hour. We were hungry, cold and tired from walking around the show and the walk there and didn't feel like trying our luck somewhere else.She agreed to the pinky swear and said we could have the table for 1.5 hours.The food, wait staff and management were outstanding.The manager checked in on us often to see if everything was alright.We did have one problem with my coffee and it was no big deal, but the manager went above and beyond to remedy the situation.Overall great place in a cool area, great staff. The place had a great energy.Go you won't be dissappointed..",5,3/18/2017,City Tap House
989,"City Tap House is a fine addition to the already great selection of bar-restaurants in Seaport. I first got to know of it from a friend with whom I lived in Philadelphia. I did not know what he was talking about when he suggested having dinner here, assuming he was talking about the wonderfully memorable West Philly location of our grad school days. I was pleased to learn they opened a location here in Boston, and checked it out within its first few days of opening. I since returned with another Philly friend (who expressed the same initial confusion). All of us concluded that the Boston installation is a pretty solid location, though it lacks some of the attributes (central bar and fire pits) that makes the original so great. It's fair to say this review is colored by a comparison to the original, and indeed I was not so impressed with the tartufo pizza I had, expecting it to be similar to Philly's (it was a little oily for my taste). The dry rub wings however were just as good, and of course preserved was the extensive beer list. So, even though this review is biased by my high expectations from the original, City Tap House Boston is still a great location with a nice ambiance which I will definitely return to.",4,3/20/2017,City Tap House
990,"Very excited to have this new addition to the Seaport! While I wouldn't say it's inexpensive, it's nice to have a reasonably priced restaurant/bar that doesn't verge on dive-bar. It's definitely one of our new favorite after-work/dinner/brunch spots in Boston. The food is excellent, as is the friendly service staff and manager, who has come to introduce himself a couple times since opening. My one reservation about this place that I hope and cross my fingers they may take into consideration sometime soon... is the lack of sound attenuation. Sitting on the dining room side after work or on a Friday/Saturday evening is almost unbearable because the noise from the bar carries over. I can barely hear my table-mates right next to me and it makes for an unfortunate shouting experience over an otherwise really nice meal.",4,3/22/2017,City Tap House
991,"Huge selection of craft beers on tap and bottles, including meads, ciders, and sours.  Came here for lunch, although the menu is fairly limited for lunch, I ordered the prime rib french dip, which had tender juicy slices of prime rib with horseradish, au jus, and a basket full of fries.  We also got the City burger, which was excellent as well.  Nice big bar/pub room, very friendly service.  I would come back here again for sure.  They also have daily supper specials, and the website has a menu with them on it.",4,3/22/2017,City Tap House

993,"Was traveling to Boston for the first time and before we started our day, we wanted to grab some brunch. We walked into a very nice, moderately full restaurant and was immediately seated, greeted, and served water. Service was very attentive and incredibly nice. We ordered the Big Chick and the Chicken and Waffles and the food served was amazing with large portions given. The chicken was very crispy but still nice and juicy. The biscuits, gravy, and bacon that came with the Big Chick were perfect. The waffles were fluffy. The drinks were also great. The restaurant was incredibly clean. There was also free and fast wifi which is another plus. Although the price was a little steep, I'd say it's pretty typical for the area and justifiable by the fact that it was kind-of a special occasion.",5,3/26/2017,City Tap House
994,"Great brunch and drink menu. Settled on the roasted pork sandwich and got cheese sauce on it instead of the pepper jelly, delicious. The broccoli rabe in the sandwich gave it a nice crunch. Will be back!",5,3/26/2017,City Tap House
995,"I am not sure where to start.  I don't write many reviews here but this place kinda blew me away and I feel I need to.  Out here on business and there are many other places nearby that beg for me to stop by but there is something so ""real"" about this place that I am compelled to come back time and time again.  I know I will be here every night I am in town and would encourage anyone who has good taste in beer to make it a point to stop by.  If you don't you are missing out.  The bar service is A+ and the food is really amazing - had their signature burger and a Cesar salad with chicken - both of which were insanely good!  Stop by and you won't regret it.",5,3/27/2017,City Tap House

999,"Great place, with a fun environment, especially in the warmer months. Their food and drink options are all excellent, and quite tasty. I would highly recommend their 10 spice wings.

Our bartender was the best.  We were never left waiting (or wanting!). The restaurant is spacious and well equipped with TVs.  It would be an awesome place to watch a game.  Or hang on the back patio when the weather is nice.  Make sure to visit if you are in Boston.  We will definitely be back!",4,4/19/2017,City Tap House

1005,Great menu great atmosphere! Can't wait til the weather gets better and we can be out on the patio!!! The staff is very helpful. We were a party of 12 so that couldn't have been easy. Something for everyone on the menu. Lots of other menu items I want to come back and try! The bar is fun too. I came here once before for brunch and the beermosa is great!!!  Definitely make a reservation.,5,4/27/2017,City Tap House
1006,Terrible customer service...After waiting with the hostess our party was sat at two separate tables only to be told half our our party could no longer have that table. The wait staff and manager were quite rude and it was very disappointing to see such rude service. Will not be returning.,1,4/28/2017,City Tap House
1007,Stopped by this Saturday and the place was rocking. The beer list is extensive as you might think. Both indoor and outdoor seating. Bartenders were attentive and seemed to know the tap list pretty well if you need help. Will be back.,4,4/30/2017,City Tap House
1008,"My friends and I had dinner here last Saturday night; we wanted to check out a new restaurant in the Fort Point area. While we all enjoyed the food and service, the loud atmosphere was a huge turn-off.CTH serves ""elevated American pub fare"" and we were very impressed with all the dishes that we ordered! Recommend: wings (well-seasoned), Pancho mussels (meaty mussels and flavorful broth), Saturday Special 16 oz. steak (perfectly cooked and juicy), and the pizza (the most pillowy dough ever and great toppings). I'm not much of a beer drinker so can't review the craft beer selection. The cocktail menu was not very appealing to me either (Moscow Mule with kombucha? Eww), but I learned that the bar can make any custom cocktail - will have to test them out next time!CTH also had coat check, patio seating, and outdoor fire pits. Meter parking in Fort Point is usually impossible - definitely take Uber.I am docking off stars due to the bad acoustics/noise level; it was unbearably loud coming from the bar area! Expect to shout during your entire meal if you're here on Thur-Sat evenings. I will return for the food next time, but probably on quieter nights like Sun-Wed.",3,5/1/2017,City Tap House
1009,This review is only for the bar area and having beer. They have a great selection of drafts here. You can get flights and small pours or full pints. The only issue is that during busy times they are understaffed and ordering a beer can take a long time.,4,5/7/2017,City Tap House
1010,Only had drinks here but had a full bar with a nice selection of wine and beers.  Tried Kentucky Vanilla Barrel Cream Ale and it is our new favorite beer.  The bartender was pleasant and more than willing us to sample drinks before ordering.,3,5/9/2017,City Tap House
1011,"Came in on Sunday afternoon, service was pretty slow but thats because they were slammed. beer selection was good but I thought it could have been better, food was on point! we got the wings and a pizza and it was delicious",4,5/10/2017,City Tap House
1012,"I had very high hopes for this place as it is always pack with young professionals but left quite disappointed .We were sit right away on a Wednesday night and the bar was packed .We ordered some apps and stop right there.We ordered the trout sliders and we couldn't eat them. The bread very heavy for a delicate dish and the trout ""maionese "" concussion were extremely salty. The Korean short rib tacos was also salty and Luke warm.The Brussels sprouts were delicious just like I like it, a little bit salty, completely toasted .The atmosphere was great but this is a very loud place. I don't mind but not a place for a Roma tic dinner.The absolutely plus is the staff. I will come back because you can fix the food .The staff is very attentive and very fast.They have a full bar and has everything someone ca n ask.Hopefully ; management will read this review and take care of the food. The options on the menu sound awesome but the execution is terrible.",3,5/10/2017,City Tap House

We got corn and crab hush puppies, Mexican corn and chips, crab Mac n cheese, Brussels sprouts, Sriracha cauliflower, prosciutto and fig pizza, pesto and honey pizza, and the ricotta fritters. (I was with a large group) We tried many cocktails and a ton of beers from their extensive collection of craft beers. Everything Keith suggested was spot on phenomenal! I cannot wait to come back! Seriously, Keith will make your night and make you want to come back weekly!",5,5/11/2017,City Tap House
1014,"Great place, cool vibe and if you are lucky enough to get Keith as a waiter, you are going to have a great night! He was friendly, proactive in refills and honest about helping with menu selections. He talked us out of some of our food order because he looked at our table and knew we were ordering too much. That's a great waiter for you. If you go, ask for Keith's section. You won't be disappointed.We had a table of 7 and we did a sampling of lots of their small plates and appetizers. We had the Sriracha Cauliflower, Corn & Crab Hush Puppies, Charred Brussels Sprouts, Blue Crab Mac & Cheese, Abigail Mussels, Elote Street Corn Dip, Prosciutto & Fig Pizza and the Honey & Goat Cheese Pizza.The beverage manager, Greg, was also great and very knowledgeable of everything they have on the very extensive beer list. He spent plenty of time with our table making sure we ordered something to our taste preference.We were there from 5-10pm on a Thurs. night and the bar stayed crowded the whole night.Great place! Will be back many times.",5,5/12/2017,City Tap House
1015,"Was here twice this past week...First time was for Sunday brunch.We decided to sit outside in the patio- it was a little chilly but the sun was out and the all of the tables receive direct sun so we didn't even notice. The outdoor space has fire pits to sit and drink by and there is corn-hole set up as well. The space is pretty large and you don't feel like you're sitting on top of any other tables which is always nice.  Had a Bloody Mary (their mix is perfectly seasoned not to salty and just spicy enough) and their Beer-mosa (very light and refreshing). Both great. Food wise we tried the Brussels Sprouts, Tartufo pizza and a burger. The Brussels Sprouts are a must. The second time I was here was for after-work drinks on a Thursday. We reserved a table ahead of time (inside) since we were with a big group and it's a good thing we did! It was PACKED at 5 PM. Our waiter was Keith and he was an absolute pro. Incredibly personable, attentive and knowledgeable. He was eager to make drink recommendations and didn't fail us once during the evening. Definitely recommend trying the house mule with vodka infused hops. Food Highlights: crab & corn hush puppies, Brussels sprouts (again!),mussels, and the Honey, Goat cheese and pistachio-pesto pizza. Kieth rounded out the evening with a surprise dessert for us- fried ricotta balls rolled in cinnamon-sugar...I mean... what else can you ask for? BIG thank you. Will be back soon!",5,5/12/2017,City Tap House
1016,"This place was AMAZING! By far, the best blueberry pancakes I've ever had in my entire life and the Hangover pizza -- whoever thought of that was a genius. Top it off with the Beermosas -- absolutely amazing. If I lived closer, I'd be here every Saturday morning.",5,5/12/2017,City Tap House
1017,"I want to give it more stars, but the host ruined that. We waited for them to get someone to take us to our table and then happened to see a friend while we were waiting. We chatted with them and then the host was ready for us so he began saying ""ummm hello lady???!!!!"" Because we talked with a friend. This is a social place and I'm about to spend $$$ here, give me a break and don't be rude.",2,5/13/2017,City Tap House
1018,"I came here Sunday for brunch and was super happy that I did! I absolutely loved the ambiance inside...very trendy with exposed ceilings but still a cozy vibe. Unfortunately the weather was not on our side so we didn't get to take advantage of the outdoor seating, complete with hanging lights and firepits, but I can't wait to come back and hang out in the warmer weather.The food is ""elevated"" american type cuisine. The wings were to die for! They aren't tossed with sauce but instead covered in their ""ten spice"" recipe. Amazing! The big chick brunch meal had some of the best fried chicken I've tasted in awhile. The only downfall was that my burger never arrived. We weren't in any rush so I wasn't annoyed at the time. The waitress noticed immediately that I didn't have my food and took care of it right away. Although everyone was finished with their meals by the time mine actually arrived, the manager came right over to our table to apologize and let us know that the burger would be taken off the bill. The staff did this proactively, instead of waiting for me to complain, which I greatly appreciated. Great customer service! Overall, I will definitely be coming back here for the wings and the outdoor firepits!",4,5/15/2017,City Tap House
1019,"I was surprised how empty this place was on a weekend night when I visited for dinner, and maybe this should have been more of a warning. We were seated immediately, but things started to go downhill from there. Our waiter seemed to be living in another world. We rarely saw him. Even when we were served our meals, he ran away to hide immediately. He didn't check in afterwards, so one member of our party missing ketchup for her burger was left helpless for 15mins until we went to ask at the bar. The bartender then sent another worker to promptly deliver the ketchup, and shortly after that we finally saw our waiter trying to cover for his absence my briskly walking 5 ft from our table, asking, ""are you alright?"", responding without hesitation to himself, ""yeah,"" and then running away once more to the kitchen. At least they left pitchers of water so we weren't constantly demanding refills while he was missed.The food made up for some, but not all of the poor service. The Abagail mussels were a surprisingly great way to start the meal, even for someone who has never been a big fan of mussels. The elote corn dip was another delightful appetizer, though the dish was much to shallow to take full advantage of the chips it was served with. For a main course, the steak and egg fried rice was supremely disappointing. $19 for a well done, simple steak served over gooey, far to liquidy rice with a fried egg. On top of the strange consistency of the rice, the whole dish was pretty bland, and I would have loved to have been offered sriracha sauce to add some flavor. As far as the other main entrees at the table went, no one was overwhelmed. The price point was pretty high for all of the plates, and no one was wowed enough to justify the cost. Side annoyance about not only this place, but almost every restaurant in Boston: why can't you separate checks for large parties?? It is 2017, folks! Every other place in the country asks you as soon as you sit down how to break out the checks, how to split shared appetizers (yes, it can be divided evenly on each check!), and the ones with suggested tips based on set percentages are just top tier in my book.",2,5/17/2017,City Tap House
1020,Great atmosphere and concept. BUT We sadly had some of the worst service I've had in Boston. One of the bartenders was flat out rude and acted like she didn't want to be there. We repeatedly checked on our table (which took two visits to the host stand for us to actually be entered). We were told 1.5 hours and after 2.5 hours left to go elsewhere. Even when asking where the restroom was or about sitting outside the staff was rude. Hopefully the issues get resolved as I want to like this place and make it a regular stop but there's plenty of other options in the seaport with good service.,2,5/17/2017,City Tap House
1021,"What an amazing experience! Our waiter Keith was THE BEST! We ate on the outside patio and ordered a bunch of apps and drinks. Keith made the best suggestions and our food was amazing. Highly recommended the brussel sprouts, pizza, and bone marrow!",5,5/18/2017,City Tap House
1022,"Cool place with outdoor seating and fires to sit around. Gets pretty full on weekend nights but what do you expect in the city. Beer prices aren't terrible and the selection is decent enough. Only down side is they serve their ""full"" pints in those crappy pint glasses that have have 2"" of solid glass on the bottom so they basically are ripping you off 2 ounces(you're not getting a standard 16 ounce pour that you usually do in a a pint of beer...you're getting 14 ounces).",3,5/22/2017,City Tap House
1023,"Came here for drinks and snacks with a few friends. We ordered a couple beers, wine and the pulled pork nachos and chorizo arancini. This place gets pretty crowded and I would say they are short staffed. Our server was friendly, but she was really busy, we didn't get to her much and the food and drinks took quite a while. They also messed up our drink order for the first time, everyone was served the wrong drink....I ordered the ginger kombucha from urban farm and it was rather enjoyable. It was light with a 1.5% ABV and had a strong but not overwhelming ginger taste.The pulled pork nachos was pretty decent. It had a good amount of pork, that was seasoned well and juicy. It was topped with BBQ sauce, cheese sauce, onions and peppers too. Overall, a decent nacho dish but not fantastic. Personally I didn't really like the arancini because I couldn't really taste the chorizo, and it wasn't very cheesy as well. The tomato sauce just overpowered almost all the flavors.",3,5/28/2017,City Tap House
1024,"I'm thinking the rating should be more like 2.5 stars. The biggest shortcomings here is the absolutely terrible service!! The servers aren't pleasant, no sense of urgency, no manners, not even an ""I'll be with you in a few"". We sat at a wet table, was given a wet menu when asked what was on tap. The Brussel sprouts were amazing however the Tartufo pizza was not cooked enough. Not only was the yolk of the egg runny on the pizza which would've been ok, but the egg white was runny too, making us unable to finish it. You've got work ahead of you!!!! Start with training your servers basic customer service skills....instead of just saying I'm sorry for the delay, what can I get you.....telling me that you're slacking behind the bar is definitely not what I want to hear. Never once did I also hear or see ANY of the specials for Shuckfest.",3,5/29/2017,City Tap House
1025,"Good beer selection. Otherwise, the food is hardly worth mentioning. Ordered steak and eggs for brunch, $22, left hungry and unsatisfied.Here's why - ordered rare steak, got about 3 oz of medium rare steak. Ribeye? Maybe. Two eggs, over medium. Got one easy, one hard. I guess they average. And the filler - potatoes - were hard and undercooked. I didn't see a single plate at my 8-person table finish their potatoes. To the owner - I went on a Sunday, after the half marathon. I understand you bring your second string to brunch, that's industry standard, but they need to know how to cook potatoes. Especially if it's 50% of your $22 dish. Caramelized onions were a nice touch though.",2,5/30/2017,City Tap House
1026,"There are two things I cannot recommend more: the pancho mussels and the honey and goat cheese pizza. The pancho mussels are a big plate so good enough for your meal and if you're weirdly not full, ask for more bread to dip in that most wonderful broth. The honey and goat cheese pizza is sooo good, I wish I could recreate/cook it at home. It's light and has a hint of truffle oil if I'm right? I liked this pizza especially because it doesn't have caramelized onions like most goat cheese pizzas. And obviously the beer selection is good and they keep the beer coming.",5,5/30/2017,City Tap House
1027,"I want to start out by saying I'm in the industry. I've worked all around boston for the last several years. I totally get how difficult it is when places get busy. I rarely have Saturday nights off but I went this past Saturday night with two other people. The bar was full but from a front of house standpoint, no where near ""packed"". There were two bartenders on and what looked like a manager helping out on service bar. I stood over the bar in between a couple eating for 11 minutes. I timed it because I was in disbelief that I stood there for so long. The bartender couldn't of been more than 1 foot from my face refusing to even look up to make eye contact with me to say hello as she put away glassware. I normally give places a second chance, and believe me I get when you're busy. But in hospitality, you're never too busy to say hello. And after 11 minutes of waiting to be greated for a cocktail, its safe to say my friends and I will NEVER go back here again.",2,6/1/2017,City Tap House
1028,"Me and 3 girlfriends went last night as repeat customers. Our server Shannon was awesome from the get-go. We immediately ordered the pulled pork nachos.So nachos need layers, yes? These were not what we expected and Shannon knew right away when we asked her if she could just add some more toppings....Shannon immediately sent them back and brought out a NEW order that we were proud to call our nachos! These IVY LEAGUE nachos were done RIGHT.In the meantime, the GM, Kurt, came over apologized and talked with us about our first world problems (this weather stinks, we love the goat cheese pizza, the fire places are LIT) then offering us free round of beers - fine, thank you Captain Kurt! Once we got the bill we saw our nachos were taken off as well. Although we had some bumps in the road everyone there did everything they could to make up for it. We will be back for sure! (Also, the noise has been reduced because of the soundproofing products they recently installed.)....and the apply crisp was a must.",5,6/2/2017,City Tap House

1031,"I love City Tap. If you are looking for a new place and the best brews in the city, you have come to the right place. Jaclyn was our server and she was phenomenal.

Thank you very much!!",5,6/3/2017,City Tap House

1033,"I've never posted before, I usually just go one here to find good places to eat when I'm out of town, but I just had to write a review after my experience last night. When we arrived for my uncle's birthday party I was worried because it was really loud. We had family in from all over the world and wanted to catch up. This is the last time I was worried all night. They had us in a private room and once our entire party arrived they closed the doors and it was like we were in a totally separate space. Things just got better from there. The manager introduced us to the Head server Carrie and Jess. They were all extremely helpful and seemed genuinely happy to be there. Now let's talk beer! Wow! Carrie went over their sections on the menu and her knowledge was extensive. I wanted bud light but ended up being glad they didn't carry it. She recommended Pivo Pills and she knocked it out of the park! When I ordered another, she joked and said let's take a step in another direction and told me about the original wheat beer and I loved that too!Food! Everything was amazing. The goat cheese flat bread was pleasantly surprising. Not a fan of goat cheese normally but the sweetness complimented the cheese and I couldn't put it down. Other notables were the hushpuppies, Korean tacos and BBQ pork sliders. Next time I'm back in Boston I'm going back. Everything was above and beyond! Hopefully Carrie will be there to help me find another favorite beer. City tap: you're on to something and your service and food are 5 stars all day! Thank you for memories that will last a lifetime.",5,6/4/2017,City Tap House
1034,"Went here on a Sunday for brunch and if it weren't for the hostess this place would have 4 stars. I saw they had 5 open tables outside, and asked if we could get a table for 2 outside, to which she said ""no, the wait was over an hour"".  The inside was empty so you would think they would sit us near the window, but instead escorted us to the way back of the restaurant. I see there are about 10-15 empty booths so I ask if we could sit in one of those and she tells me no, with no explanation. OK, I thought this was City Tap, not the Capital Grille, so why all the attitude?? Literally within 10 minutes a different hostess seats another party of 2 next to us and said ""would you like a table or a booth"". Seriously? Why couldn't that be the hostess that seated me? Instead I got the one with the attitude. Luckily our server was really nice and did a great job.  The rustic décor was awesome and seemed to have an overall good vibe, playing old school hip hop.  We order the fig and prosciutto pizza and blueberry pancakes to split and both were yummy. We also tried the Beermosa which was actually pretty good. Unfortunately I just can't get over all the attitude that was thrown my way within my first 5 minutes! With so many other ""rustic"" pizza kitchens in the area, I probably wouldn't go here again.",3,6/5/2017,City Tap House
1035,"I've been lurking on Yelp for a while, but never felt inspired enough to leave a review until my visit here.I came here with my family this past Friday and sat on the patio. Our server was Axandra, and she was fantastic. The beer list was a little intimidating, but in a good way. I wound up with a flight of wild/sour beers(love them but I don't have a ton of knowledge on them), which she helped me choose, and it was PERFECT. We got a few family style appetizers to start, everything was good, we all agreed the corn dip was the best. For dinner I had the salmon, which knocked my socks off. The ambiance was great, Axandra was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. As a fellow server, I know that that is a delicate balance, and she nailed it. It's hard for my family to find a restaurant that we all agree on, we rarely visit the same spot twice as a group. We already have plans to go back for brunch",5,6/6/2017,City Tap House
1036,"Great after work spot to blow off some steam. The beer menu is excellent, and the apps and pizza were excellent. The arancina was delicious! Great attentive service, and we LOVED the patio.

1038,"I've been in customer service for years, and I rarely take the time to write a review, but we came here for brunch and after waiting an hour had the rudest host who sat us in a room with an entire birthday party when there were tons of other tables open. He then had the audacity to ask to take one of our chairs that all of our belongings were in even though there were about 30 empty chairs within sight range. Very disappointed with the customer service, and I hope the rude gentleman host has since been let go. It was because of him that we ended up leaving after our first drink and taking our $100 brunch bill somewhere else. We probably will never come back. We never got to try the food, and the waiter was kind but it was too little too late.",1,6/9/2017,City Tap House
1039,Just finished an excellent lunch at city tap! Our server Keith was AH-MAZING. Definitely eat on the patio. Try the avocado/grapefruit salad and the burger (SO good). Awesome selection of beers. We will be back for weekly lunch meetings!,5,6/9/2017,City Tap House
1040,Great beers and service! Came in with a friend and had a few rounds on a hot Friday. Tiffany is really friendly and knowledgeable about the product at the bar and we'll definitely be back! Looking forward to spending some time outside on the patio as well.,5,6/9/2017,City Tap House
1041,Amazing food. Don't leave without trying the honey &a goat cheese pizza. Staff is awesome every time I come here.  Refreshing to have a staff this is accommodating and doesn't require the entire party to be present to be seated.,5,6/9/2017,City Tap House

1045,Keith kicked some ass. Food and beers were good.  I would've liked a better beer selection (particularly considering they're right around the corner from Trillium). But all in all had a solidly enjoyable time.  Outside seating was pretty easy to come by and the mixed drinks were pretty good.  Had a shot of whiskey from some bone marrow that was nifty.,4,6/10/2017,City Tap House
1046,"I love this place for brunch or a drink, not too crowded... yet. I was here last week and our server Jaclynn was great! I'm from Belgium and told her to just bring me a delicious Belgian beer as I was feeling home sick (and to keep them coming) and that's what just she did!",5,6/11/2017,City Tap House

1048,"5 beer tastes for $15. Not too shabby as they have many beer options available. Great deal! This was our pre dinner appetizers, and they were okay. We got the corn dip with tortilla chips, burrata with bread, and Brussels sprouts. The Brussels came with this hoisin like sauce, it was a bit too thick and sweet in flavor, but had a great crunch. Felt like it needed some pancetta or chorizo bits. The corn dip and burrata was decent... nothing fancy, so taste what it looks like. Place was pretty packed around 4ish and it was raining outside. Staff was friendly.",3,6/14/2017,City Tap House
1049,"Pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the food here. The brussels sprouts and sriracha cauliflower apps were both delicious, as were the Verona mussels. The tomatoes in the sauce over the mussels alone were to die for. The avocado and grapefruit salad was also very good. We dined here on a Friday for a friends birthday and they provided us with complimentary shots post dinner. Would have given five stars if the management didn't try to push us to purchase the 3 liter bottle of rose... but overall great experience and will definitely be back!",4,6/14/2017,City Tap House
1050,"Our man Jon - the best waiter of all time - made our dining experience superb. He provided us with flowing liquor, prime pizza and the smile of all smiles.

As written on a bathroom stall - call this place for a good time.",5,6/15/2017,City Tap House

The interior is rustic and spacious with a large bar and 7 or 8 big screen TVs. Large patio with outside seating under shaded umbrellas available. We had absolutely no wait for a party of 4 on a late Sunday afternoon during Sail Boston. The mussels were delicious as were the salads. We didn't go much further into the menu, but there is a good mix of steak and seafood. Each table has its own chilled bottle of water which is a really nice touch on a warm day - and the air conditioning is a welcome relief.",4,6/18/2017,City Tap House
1052,"Came here with a large group and no reservation one Saturday and they were completely accommodating. Reeeeaaaaaaally loved the pizza I had, think it was the one with honey.The space was dope, the beers were tasty, and the location was right around the corner from other cool bars to hit up after eats.I even left my shades in my drunken revelry and an hour or so later when I returned they were still there waiting for me (still, I don't recommend doing this).Go here.",4,6/22/2017,City Tap House
1053,"I love sitting outside at City Tap and having a beer.City Taps's 5 page beer menu is one of the more impressive beer menus I have seen in Boston.  On my last visit, I particularly enjoyed the von Trapp Golden Helles Lager (Stowe VT - Pilsner - 4.9% ABV - 14oz - $6.50).  ***DEFINITIVELY A 5-STAR BEER MENU!***The location of their outdoor seating is great; as the evening comes the seating area becomes shady so on hot summer evenings one does not swelter.  The only drawback is the outdoor seating is located near busy streets.As far as the food goes I only have had the giant pretzel (served hot with dipping sauces) which I seem to get every time I come here.  The pizzas and massive servings of pulled-pork nachos I always see everyone ordering always look amazing.To this point, I have not had any issues with the service.After 5pm things do get really busy here.",4,6/24/2017,City Tap House

They do not take reservations for outdoor seating but we got there at 7:30 and put our name in for a table outside. In the meantime we were planning on sitting at the bar inside but the little benches with the fire tops are first come, first serve seating and the server comes over there too. It worked out so well- we had a drink and were able to sit outside, you can  eat in that area too but we wanted to sit at a table for dinner. By 8:30 we had moved up to table outside. I had the pesto pistachio pizza and it was delicious!! My two friends both got the crab sandwich- they both said they really liked it but also wished it came with fries :) There are TONS of beers on tap which I loved. I made a little flight and then ordered my favorite for dinner. My friends had sangria and also liked that. I will definitely come back!",4,6/28/2017,City Tap House

1059,I went here on a Friday night and made a reservation 2 days earlier for 6. We were seated right away. Service was a little slow but not too bad. Our waitress was so nice. She recommended the Brussel sprouts and they were delicious! I also split the margherita pizza and pulled pork nachos. I loved the pizza and would get it again. The pulled pork was different than the way I usually have it. The texture was more like tuna fish rather than pulled pork. I'm not sure if I would get it again. The atmosphere was great and I will definitely be going back!,4,7/1/2017,City Tap House
1060,"Visiting Boston today we stumbled upon this place.  Good atmosphere, happening place, outdoor and indoor environments.  We had pizzas and salad to share with my party.  Pizzas were great!

1061,"Hard pass on brunchPros: good beer selection Cons: brunch food and serviceI visited for Sunday brunch and my eggs Benedict was barely meh.  It seemed like it was preprepared and sitting under a warmer for a long time.  The eggs, biscuit, and pork belly were all overcooked.  The potatoes were hard  and the hollandaise sauce had the appearance of nacho cheese sauce.The restaurant was way over staffed with groups of servers and bartenders socializing. There were very few customers in the restaurant or at the bar.   I sat at the bar and only got service each time I waved one of the three  bartenders over. This might be a good place for happy hour but I wouldn't eat a meal here again.",2,7/2/2017,City Tap House
1062,"Food was good...HOWEVER, there is one thing that I have a MAJOR complaint about - I wanted to sit inside. My asshole friends made me sit outside and the hostess sat us at a table with no umbrella. After 20 minutes of sweating my ass off we asked to move tables. For the rest of our meal we watched the hostess continuously try to seat people in the sunny ass table with no fucking umbrella. Each time they asked for a table in the shade and the hostess seemed annoyed when they moved them. Our forks were on fire too.",1,7/2/2017,City Tap House

I've tried to go here two other times after work and it's always packed with a long wait for tables (good problem to have!) The beer and cocktails were great, we also ordered a margherita pizza and mussels with fries. The mussels were very delicious. They serve them 4 ways, and we chose the dish with tomato sauce and chorizo. The bread they serve with the mussels is the perfect compliment and the sauce was so rich and tasty. The manager took the time to stop by and chat with us to make sure we were having a good experience (he also suggested adding fries to the leftover tomato sauce- YUM) which was a nice touch. I've been to places less than half full of guests and you aren't normally treated special. SO yummy, can't wait to go back and order the same thing and try something new on the side!",4,7/3/2017,City Tap House

The food was pretty good (much better than expected), the drinks good, and prices modest.However, we will not be returning due to a very bad experience with one specific waiter. It was super sunny out, and we sat outside. There were a couple of umbrellas and one at the table next to us. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to cover us, but we accepted that, as all were in use.When the table next to us left, a good while after we came, the server came over and immediately moved the umbrella next to us. However, soon after a 3 men came and sat down, and the server came running over, and told my friend and I he was going to move the umbrella to cover the men, and we could move our table if we wanted to stay under. We were shocker, as were the guys next to us, who stopped the waiter and just moved their table towards the umbrella.We found this to be incredibly sexist and rude, and are extremely upset about our treatment.",2,7/3/2017,City Tap House
1067,"2 stars bc the food was actually good once we got it and the beer selection, particularly their sours and lineup of kombuchas were nice. We came across this place after not being able to get into Row 34 since they closed for a private event. The good:-convenient location -beer selections-elote dip-burger (if it comes hot)-goat cheese and honey pizza The not so good:-There was a manager who came to the table a few minutes after we sat down but it wasn't a cause for concern yet because we had been greeted and had our waters. We were waiting on getting our beers and ready to place the order when she got back. We understood things sometimes take time so we weren't upset at that point. From the moment put in our drink order (2 flights and a beer) it was over 20 minutes before she came back to say that one of them was out and asked what to substitute it with. I knew exactly how long because I was able to reference my ""check in"" time on Yelp. She didn't ask for our food order at any point during that wait or even when she came back to the table to tell us about the beers. -the table next to us had to send back their burger for some reason but they did seemingly comp him a beer for the inconvenience -we finally put the food order in and the apps came out at the same time as the other food. We saw a tabletop of 2 that came in way after us get served their food before we did -there were only 14 people in the restaurant (not including a 1/2 full patio) and it took 57 minutes from the time I ""checked in"", until the food came (I frequent made to order places and understand some orders take 45 minutes to make, but this is not a fine dining establishment) -even after waiting the long time, the burger and the French dip were lukewarm and the fries that came with each order were also not hot (the pizza was perfectly cooked and hot...maybe they held the other 2 orders until the pizza was ready?)-we didn't want to return the burger or French dip since we didn't want to wait again-we eventually had to ask another waiter if we could get new fries since our waitress not once came back around after the food was delivered -we got one order of fries replaced (~10 minutes), he offered to bring another since we had put 2 baskets to the side. The 2nd order didn't come back out. The new fries were really good, crunchy, hot, seasoned well -the men's bathroom only has a urinal and a stall, the stall was out of order-the women's bathroom has 5 stalls and 2 were out -overall we were there for a little over an hour a half when the restaurant literally appeared to have more staff than patrons If you like feeling held hostage and drinking good beer while doing so, you'll love this place.",2,7/3/2017,City Tap House
1068,"Excellent and unique brunch food that is all made in house! The veggie burger had a great depth of flavor and held together nicely, as it is made with beets and oats and topped with aged cheddar. The hollandaise sauce on the pork belly Benedict was complex in its flavor profile and creamy in texture. The Bloody Mary was great, especially the paprika-salt rimmed glass. However, the drinks were a little expensive. But, the service from our friendly and informative waiter, Jeff, was on point! Highly recommend for brunch!",4,7/4/2017,City Tap House

1073,"Just don't order the Avocado and Grapefruit Salad. Great beer selection, really yummy wings. I appreciated that the waiter offered to take order for our toddler son when he took our drink order without even needing to ask. And the kitchen dubbed a really nice bowl of roasted veggies instead of French fries for him (I don't get kids menus but that is another issue). I ordered the avocado and grapefruit salad with grilled chicken. When I saw it come out, I immediately knew that I should have asked for the dressing on the side. It was covered. Then I started to eat it; it tasted like it has been doused in sea salt, I mean doused. That is only thing I could taste. It was difficult to eat. There were white flakes all over it so I wondered if I had missed some part of the description. I pulled up the menu online to check - salt was not mentioned but it must have been the feta. I have never had something even with feta taste that salty though. I figured I would just pick out the grapefruit and avocado and try to see if that was edible but there wasn't much there. I'm not sure if no one in the kitchen has actually tasted the salad or if someone really loves salt. I recommend the restaurant overall - just don't get this dish!",3,7/8/2017,City Tap House

I mainly needed somewhere to kill time before flying back to Denver, and saw a packed patio with many twenty-somethings decked out in America gear. Tired of carrying around luggage and happy that somewhere was open in general, my friend and I stopped in. A table was surprisingly easy to get to considering the place was busy, but most people were congregating in the patio or bar area. We were seated right away, and our service continued to be consistent and friendly. The beer list was extensive, and and there was a frozen specialty cocktail that made my day. The food menu had a nice variety of dishes, with several vegetarian options. We split the burrata, the brussels sprouts, and the honey and goat cheese pizza, and I was more than happy with our meal. The biggest standout was the burrata (though honestly when is it not) as I loved the mixture of the creamy cheese with the fresh peas. All in all, it was a great place to spend time and eat a meal on an extremely quick trip to Boston.",4,7/11/2017,City Tap House
1076,"The hostess gets 3 stars and everything else about this place gets 5.My friend and I came here on a Saturday night around 7pm to get out of the rain. I realize 7pm on a weekend is prime dinner time. We were hungry but figured we could hang around the bar area if we had to wait for a table. We go in, and the hostess isn't the friendliest and when we ask for a table for 2, she says it will be at least an hour wait. We say that's fine, and ask if the tables in the bar are first come, first serve, and she says yes and that the tables are full service. At this point the bar looks pretty packed and all the tables are taken so we have her put our name down. We need to use the restroom and have to walk through the entire restaurant, and see that the dining area is literally OVER HALF EMPTY. Sooo an hour wait for 2 people?! Umm ok whatever. We use the restroom, walk up to the bar area, and sit right down at a table that just opened up. Within five, maybe ten minutes, of sitting down and already ordering drinks from our super nice server, I get a text that our table in the dining area is ready. OH REALLY? So the hour wait for a table in a half empty restaurant is ready within ten minutes? Make sense. We stayed at the bar table and enjoyed the chorizo arancini, and crab mac n cheese. Completely finished every last bite, both were sooo good! Our server also gave us a few great recommendations on bars to visit after our dinner. There were a lot of tasty sounding things on the menu, so when I'm back in Boston I'm going to make it a point to stop by here again!",4,7/12/2017,City Tap House

1078,"OBSESSED! I had been told to try City Tap House for a while now, and I finally know why! We went on a Friday evening around 8pm and were able to sit right outside. The outside had fire pits and corn hole. Our waiter was so nice and really made the experience great! We weren't sure what beer to get so we had him surprise us and he made a great choice! Though we didn't eat, the couple next to us got pizza and it looked incredible....so we decided we will be going back for the pizza really soon :)",5,7/19/2017,City Tap House
1079,This place was great I was not expecting much but omg it was great I ordered the Vietnamese inspired mussels (I forgot the name) the were great I wish I could have tried more,5,7/26/2017,City Tap House
1080,"Great place to go after work for a drink or dinner! Had a party of 3 and were able to get right in quickly. We didnt sit on the patio but loved that it was an option, and big and inviting. The place does fill up quick and can get a bit loud but luckily we were over in the corner and away from the bar and crowd so were able to continue to have good dinner conversation without yelling across a table. I did eat here again a few more times and HOLY SMOKES if it isnt obnoxiously loud. We sat in the back in the smaller room and even there had to yell at the top of our lungs to have a conversation sitting by each other. Love this place but the noise is enough to not relax you after a day at the office but drive you to insanity. It was horrible.We decided to share a bunch of small plates. Everything we had was fantastic and came out super fast! We tried everything from the tacos, to the cornbread crab hush puppies (hands down my favorite) and even got a giant bowl of the peanut mussels. They were so delicious, like a thai flavored seafood treat! Each dish came out fast too, so from the time we ordered until all dishes were out was perfect to keeping everyones appetite in check. One of the guests also ordered the steak which came out piled high with friend potato sticks. I will say it was a few two thousand many sticks but either way, they didnt go to waste when the rest of us snacked on them.One downside I will say, they have this smoked trout slider on the menu that they should really take off. We ordered it and all 3 of us were disgusted by it. The flavor was not great what so ever. We all took 1 bite each of the sliders and couldnt even finish past that one bite. It was awful.",3,7/27/2017,City Tap House
1081,"I had heard great things about the City Tap house and they did not disappoint.  From the excellent atmosphere to the attentive service and delicious food--- great dinner! Went on a Sunday night and with a Party of 6 and were sat immediately.  I had the PROSCIUTTO & FIG wood fired pizza ( prosciutto, orange-fig jam, arugula, shaved Parmesan)- so tasty and crispy.  I would order this again, although everything looks good here.  Friends had Caesar salads and burgers that they were absolutely crazy about.  Good beer and wine selection.  Fun place for dinner!",4,7/28/2017,City Tap House
1082,"Not impressed. On a fairly busy Friday night, we sat outside on the patio. The waitress helped a couple sitting inches away and ignored us. When we asked for Assistance she was rude. It took almost 20 minutes to get a round of drinks. Another couple commented to me that they were not planning on coming back due to the lack of service, I agreed.",2,7/28/2017,City Tap House
1083,"Good vibe, good scenery, good service and good food! My friend and I came for lunch on a Thursday and was seated right away. Our server Shannon did an amazing job with getting us water and always making sure our cups were never empty. The food was delivered in less than 10 mins! Highly recommend this place.",4,8/3/2017,City Tap House
1084,"The small plates here are amazing. I've heard good things about the pizza, but was way too full to order one after the appetizers. The roasted brussel sprouts are phenomenal and I could easily eat an order by myself. The ricotta was my favorite. There is a jam on top that perfectly complements the cheese and isn't overwhelming. They give you so much ricotta you'll need another order foccacia, and I was putting very generous amounts. The hummus with pita is good, but I preferred the other 2 small plates.The staff was very friendly and super accommodating. They have a nice patio with some tables and seating around fire pits, plus corn hole if you're feeling more active.",5,8/5/2017,City Tap House
1085,"Fantastic Food. They already stopped serving brunch when we arrived at 2:30 even though it was advertised to end at 3pm, though it didnt really matter. I had some Turkey Reuben sandwich that had some awesome dill pickle coleslaw? Not sure but it was awesome. The fries that came with it were excellent as well, and the fig and goat cheese pizza had the perfect level of sweetness. The price was decent as well.",4,8/11/2017,City Tap House
1086,"Updated (8.15.17) from 2 to 4 stars due to the quick response from City Tap's management team. ---------I'm conflicted giving City Tap such a low star rating. If I were to simply rate the ambiance and food, I would give it a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. Not bad, right? My issue with the establishment is solely based on the outright rude, condescending, and inappropriate way my friends and I were spoken to by one of the staff members. Anyway, this is Yelp so I'll talk about the food first because let's be real, that's prob why you're sifting through reviews and I don't want to stand in the way of a hungry stomach and food (#hangry).We were a group of 10, so we started with a bunch of apps to share. If you like veggies, get the brussel sprouts. If you don't like veggies, get the brussel sprouts. They're so. damn. good. I have no idea what they are cooked in (loads of butter? Duck fat? Crack? Wait, what?), but this was definitely my favorite appetizer. We also ordered the wings, cauliflower, and some sort of dip (clearly, very memorable). These dishes were good, but nothing to rave about. Would I have them again? Sure. Would I go out of my way to get them? Nah. If you're someone who gets concerned about portion sizes and whether or not you'll leave hungry - you probably won't. The portion sizes incredibly generous for apps/entrees/etc.  As for my meal, I ordered the Pancho mussels without the fries. It was really flavorful (a tiny bit too salty, but still really good) and filling. Recommend.Okay, now the part that will likely keep me from ever returning to City Tap:Like I said, we were a group of 10. City Tap doesn't have a policy regarding how many cards you can split between, so we split the check between 8 of us, with the totals written on the back. Our waitress, who was really nice, was clearly a bit annoyed and told us that she couldn't run the cards with the tip amounts included because their system won't let them swipe for amounts higher than the check. She couldn't stress this enough, the system cannot charge over what the total check is for. Fine. So we deduced $30 from one person's total, which we would add later to the tip line. When the waitress came back, one of the receipts, which should have only been for $48.00, was charged $78.00. Oh, so your system CAN charge more than what the bill is - cool. Anyway, so you're probably thinking, ""Lisa, sure that's annoying, but no big deal."" .This is when things get exciting. And by ""exciting"" I mean, super unprofessional. My friends and I decide to continue the night by drinking beers by one of the fire pits outside. We're sitting outside, chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool, when this dude approaches us and asks, ""Hey, how was everything? I just want to make sure things were okay. Food, service..."" ""Things were great! Thanks-"" ""Oh, great, yeah I just wanted to check because you guys only left a $15 tip on a ~$300 bill so I just wanted to make sure everything was okay."" Pause. Let that sink in for a second. This random man, who didn't introduce himself, comes over to us, and accuses us for leaving a $15 tip (which was incorrect, obviously, we're not savages) in front of OTHER GUESTS!?!. He started to explain what the waitress had already told us with regards to the system being unable to process amounts higher than the bill. Then, he started explaining what a receipt looked like and how there is a line that shows the total and then there is a line for the tip (oh, is that where the tip goes? In the line that says...""tip""? Thanks for clarifying). We tried to tell him numerous times that that we understood and that our waitress already explained this to us; however, she somehow managed to charge us more than our bill. He then started rubbing his temples saying, ""I know this is confusing. Math is hard. How else can I explain it so you understand?"" Excuse me? Oh, I forgot to mention that when he came over accusing us of leaving a $15 tip, we asked to see the receipts and pulled out a calculator to add them up. He was missing the overcharged slip (the one for ~$78.00) - a little suspicious and also are you kidding me?! After rounds of him telling us things like ""math is hard"" and ""(sigh) how can I possibly explain so you can understand it?"" - he went to look for the missing slip, came back and said the waitress ""didn't do good math"" and overcharged. They reversed the $78.00 amount and ran it for $48.00, which to be clear is what we had written down to be charged initially. There was no apology. We told him that the conversation was incredibly awkward and his response was, ""Yeah, these conversations are always awkward."" Bro, how many tables are you going to accusing them of not tipping well? Also, tipping is totally subjective, based on someone's experience. Yes, it's customary to tip, but do you really think it's appropriate to call a group out on it in front of other tables? That entire experience was mortifying and embarrassing. -3 stars.",4,8/15/2017,City Tap House
1087,"Updated (8.23.17) stars since City Tap's management team got back to me. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I went out with a few friends for a late night bite on Saturday. The food was really good and I wish I had the recipes but the service was pretty much non existent. We had to call the waiter over 2 times since he didn't take our drink orders and also forgot to bring them. Then a day later I was looking at my receipt and noticed I was charged for something we didn't order. So I decided to call the restaurant to see if they could charge my card back. They said they would do that if I left them my receipt number, phone number, and email (I gave them all my info). They stated it would take a day or two but it took longer.  A manager ended up reaching out to me and they made it right. The food was great but the experience but the dealing with mixed up with the receipt and customer service is making me dock some stars.",3,8/15/2017,City Tap House
1088,"Let's face it... sometimes I'm a basic white girl. I like locally sourced ingredients.I like leisurely brunch.I like fussy micro brewed beer.I like highly Instagrammable patio seating with twinkly lights.I like tastily roasted Brussels sprouts. And sometimes... I want to go to a place where I can get all those things. City Tap has been great for brunch, drinks, and dinner. The only thing I haven't done is come with a larger group, which can sometimes result in a different service experience. The best things we've tried have been the breakfast pizza, steak frites, cauliflower (I could eat this for the rest of my life), Brussels sprouts, and hummus. And yes, their tap selection is enormous. They even have a Sip of Sunshine!However, I have a hard time giving places like this five stars. You don't ever walk away thinking ""that was the best meal of my life"" - except about the cauliflower, maybe. You wish it was a bit quieter. You wish the waiters would be more attentive to your drink level before it's completely empty. But you know you'll be back, again and again, because it generally has all the things you need.

Once we put in our drink orders we ordered a variety of food.

We sat at the bar and our bartender was attentive and great with our requests to try different beers and suggesting others. Ballast Point Thai Chili Wahoo is a new favorite.

1091,"This will be the last time I update this review, because I am as sold on this spot as it comes.  This makes my 6th or 7th trip here.  Two of the recent ones we've had a waiter that left a lot to be desired, but this time, we had a great waitress.  The food, atmosphere, beers & overall package of City Tap makes it a 5-star.I've had a good portion of the menu at this point and I've never been disappointed in the food.  This time Kelsey and I went with the crab hush-puppies for an appetizer.  Delicious, lightly fried and the sauce that came on the bottom was incredible.  For a meal, I went with the Hamburger and I was extremely impressed.  You can taste the flame right in the burger and the portion of fries served with the meal are huge.  Cooked perfectly and the sesame bun was great.Kelsey ordered the Chicken Paillard which was out of this world.  I had never had this before, and I was very surprised by how good it was.  They take nearly a 1lb. chicken breast, pound it out and marinate it over night.  Then they cook the chicken and serve it UNDER arugula, shaved veggies, fingerling potatoes and mushrooms that have been tossed in a vinaigrette & olive caper relish.  It's slightly sour but the sweetness in the marinade and olive oil balances everything out perfectly.  Highly recommend.  I would never have ordered it for myself, but now I think this would be my go-to dish.Hannah L was our waitress and she was awesome.  Got us out drinks very fast.  She also went into detail about all of her personal favorites and made the ordering much easier.  Hannah was very friendly and walked by a few times to make sure we were all set with our meals and to see what we thought of it.",5,8/17/2017,City Tap House

1102,"As a previous recommender of city tap, I was very disappointed with our last experience. Heavily advertised, they hosted a 'fall for cider' event last night. (A great idea to bring together Bostonians to try local ciders just in time for fall- we were* excited. ) We arrived about 45 min after the start of the three hour event. Unfortunately, upon arrival we were greeted by stressed and rude hostess' whom were saving half the empty restaurant for reservations during a heavily advertised event. Perhaps not their fault, but a poor idea by management. The outdoor space, which is usually first come first serve make a friend and get close was closed off to reservations. Again, you are having an event and poorly utilizing the space. So, not wanting to wait two hours for dinner, we went to the bar. Oh, there were only three bartenders working the event for the entire restaurant. So, after waiting and being ignored for upwards of 25 minutes, we left. My recommendation, next time you see a really cool event at city tap on Facebook - skip it. Management and service has got to get it together.",2,9/13/2017,City Tap House

However, myself and my group were sold on the outdoor area where we could sit. Mini fire pits scattered about and lots of seating to enjoy a nice night in downtown Boston. The beer and mixed drinks offered were very good as well.

1105,"Came here for the patriots opening night with a group of six. Wasn't as crowded as we thought, but we sat at a table and not at the bar. We were served quickly and our group ordered lots of beer, the nachos, wings, and brussel sprouts. The wings and nachos were on the back of the menu and were a little tough to find. When you are seated, you get two menus, one with cocktails and food, and one extensive beer list. In terms of food, the nachos and wings were solid. The nachos had lots of ingredients that all mixed well. The wings had a sugar coating and were very crispy. Not very healthy, but tasted good. The brussel sprouts were by far the best appetizer. They were sweet but also roasted to perfection. For an entree, I got the avocado salad with steak. The steak was too well done and tasted burnt. The salad itself was good, but nothing spectacular. I liked the addition of nuts as it added a nice crunch and texture to the dish. Lastly, the service was decent. We were served pretty quickly but sometimes had to wait a long time to be checked on. Overall, a good experience.",4,9/15/2017,City Tap House

1109,"My wife and I had a fantastic dinner here, and ended up coming back for brunch (I forgot my hat, but they found it and held onto it for me).  First, dinner:  we started with the Bavarian pretzel (it's HUGE) and a side of french fries, and then went with a series of recommendations from our waiter, Keith.  While everything was delicious (I particularly recommend the Korean-style tacos), the Brussels sprouts are pure genius.  I love sprouts and try them every time I see them on a menu, and these were hands down the best I've ever tasted.  The tap list is impressively extensive, and covers every possible taste, in my opinion.Then, brunch:  the cocktails were phenomenal.  My wife had ""the wolf and the mule"" which is one of the most complex flavors I've encountered at a bar, and I tried the ""Southie Shake"" which was delicious and kind of dessert-y.  We then split the Big Chick, which is almost like asking the chef to take every unhealthy breakfast thing they had in the kitchen and putting it on one plate:  fried chicken?  Check!  Bacon?  Sure!  Sausage gravy?  No problem!  Buttermilk biscuit?  Got you covered!  Let's round this out with some fried potatoes and a fried egg!  Every bite was delicious, though I'd have preferred the egg over easy, and there should be twice as much gravy (seriously, guys, never skimp on gravy).All in all, a fantastic experience with delicious food and excellent staff.  I look forward to going back.",5,9/25/2017,City Tap House
1110,"The ambiance provided by the outdoor space at City Tap is gorgeous. I love the bench seating with the crackling fires. They are extraordinarily strict about the number of people per seating area in the outdoor space. Perhaps aggressively so. My friend was celebrating her birthday here and had probably 15 people show up for a cocktail hour before we were heading to the main event. Her husband had called ahead to request some outdoor seating and we were provided one area that sat six people. Most people were inside at the bar until we were offered a second table outside so that more people could come out and join the birthday girl. En route out, a couple people stopped at our seating area to say hi and give hugs and we were immediately told by a manager that those folks had to move on. It was obvious they were making their way to another table, so it seemed slightly over-aggressive for them to repeatedly tell us that it was only six per table. I both understand and appreciate that they are just keeping aisles open and following rules that I assume are for safety reasons, however, we are all well into our thirties, professionals and very polite. We aren't party animals and weren't acting like it, but it did fleetingly feel like management was expecting us to be trouble...That aside, the evening was very lovely. There are talented bartenders there and I really enjoyed the Whitehead Tart cocktail. It packed a punch so I only had one! The atmosphere is worth the visit and I've heard great things about the food. I'm looking forward to another visit, but next time, I'll come with a much smaller group.",4,9/26/2017,City Tap House

I went on blind faith cuz the aforementioned friend raved about this pizza and we were not disappointed. Even with this fab food and perfect old-fashion, Keithe was the highlight of the night for us. I don't think I've ever said that about a server. Keithe guided us through the menu and drinks (everything he suggested was what we wanted and absolutely perfect) and he even gave the shirt off his back for me. For those of you haven't been to City Tap, the servers wear tshirts with various sayings on the back.

Catherin made sure we had a to great table on the beautiful outside patio, just perfect for a warm September night. Our server was Katie. She was fabulous, so attentive and perfect at describing the menu and helping us choose just the right food and beverages. Speaking of beverages there is just so much!! They have specialty cocktails, a nice wine list and the largest Craft Beer menu I have ever seen. I ordered the flight just so I could try a few!! My coworkers and I had the most incredible appetizers, Burrata, Chorizo Arancini, Ten Spice Wings and Charred Brussels Sprouts. We also added a specialty of the house, the Pancho Mussels all were delicious beyond belief. By the time we were ready to order our entrees we were nearly full. But I did make room for the City Tap Burger cooked medium, just the way I like it. I also added the bacon which made it over the top. My coworkers had the chicken and waffles. Two big pieces of white meet chicken breast a top a huge waffle with maple syrup. When Katie offered desert, I just couldn't look. I was just so full. But the deserts looked delicious too. It looks like I will just have to go back soon to enjoy the deserts and try another fight. I think I could be 100 years old before I've tried them all.

1116,"For food, this place is at best, average.  I went for dinner on a Thursday night before a concert.  The place was bursting at the scenes with the afterwork crowd.  Fine, except it was so loud that we had to shout at each other just to hear our conversation throughout dinner, which was in a back room (which was quieter than the main part of the restaurant).  Our server was in training.  Maybe she hadn't ever worked as a server before, not sure, but I was not impressed.  We ordered the cauliflower appetizer and each got the Thursday special (crab cakes). The beer list is extensive but the IPA selection was uninspiring.  Our appetizer and entrees came at the same time and before the beers, which is unacceptable on all counts.  The cauliflower was pretty good, but wasn't very hot.  The crab cakes were supposed to be served with cole slaw and fries.  We got a pile of mayonnaise-y carrot slaw (a flashback to a disgusting pre-school lunch involving carrot slaw may color my opinion here) and waffle-cut chips.  We had seen fries at another table so I informed the server that the dinner ($27 and one of the most expensive items on the menu, btw) was supposed to come with fries.  ""Ah, nah, just the waffle ones,"" was her response.  When she saw my dejected expression, she asked if I would like fries.  Yes! Thanks!  But when they came out, half were burnt (the other half was so-so).  But then she charged me for them! The crab cake was OK, too much breading for my tastes and also not very hot and not enough sauce to dip them in.  It was a disappointing $100 dinner.  Wish I had just gone for a burger somewhere else and I will not return for food.  However, if you are just going for a lively after work bar scene, I guess it'll do, especially the outdoor seating looked nice.",2,10/6/2017,City Tap House
1117,"OH MY GOD!!!! That was absolutely the best fried chicken I have had in Boston. I swore off brunch four years ago, just because I felt it was a little cliche. Because of City Tap, I have put my ego aside and I am back on the brunch train!Shout out to Tory, best waitress ever!",5,10/7/2017,City Tap House
1118,This place is awesome. Great food and service! The big chick sandwich is amazing and the best fried chicken in Boston. Great place for brunch. Our waitress Tori was super nice. I definitely recommend this place.,5,10/7/2017,City Tap House
1119,"Have been there 5 times now. The service is inconsistent and it is extremely loud. The food is always great and the burgers are good. A member of our party for one of the dinners has celiacs and they provided a gluten free menu. It turns out it is NOT gluten free so please beware or you will get sick!  Staff is certainly not trained on allergies. Again -  good food, inconsistent service, very loud atmosphere and I would not recommend if you want a conversation. Probably will not be going anymore.",3,10/8/2017,City Tap House
1120,"Awesome food and great beverage selection (they are known for their beer, but they easily have one of the best cider selections in Boston). The service can be spotty, but the food and drinks are worth it. Have tried the cauliflower, pretzel, Brussels sprouts and burrata appetizers: all amazing. I'm not sure I could pick one that's a favorite, they're just that good. The veggie burger is great, and my husband loves the pork sandwich. The atmosphere is cool too. We love sitting on the patio by the fire with a class of our favorite beverage :)",4,10/8/2017,City Tap House
1121,"We had a larger group: around 6 people and got seated right away. Server was nice and got everything right, but he was quite slow. We waited an hour to be able to put our food order in. Drinks came slowly as well. Food was good for the price (ordered the blue crab Mac and cheese, pulled pork nachos, margarita pizza, etc) but the best thing about here is the gorgeous outdoor area and the extensive beer list. Great selection of seasonal beers!",4,10/9/2017,City Tap House
1122,"I came here about a month ago, and to this day, I still dream about the Brussels sprouts with pomegranate seeds.  This dish essentially combines two of my favorite things ever, but even from an unbiased point of view, there's nothing not to like about this dish!  It's so flavorful and and the Brussels sprouts are cooked perfectly (most places can't get them quite right, but this place does). I came up with a group of eight and we sat outside and shared a bunch of the small dishes (Brussels sprouts, mac n cheese, wings, tacos, etc...but the Brussels sprouts...did I mention the Brussels sprouts?) I also love the decor of this place.  It's super chill and it's nice to sit outside, weather-permitting.  Their drinks are also pretty strong, so I highly recommend  their cocktails.  Our waitress was super attentive and accommodating to our requests.  After writing this review, I definitely made myself hungry and may plan a dinner at City Tap in the near future...",5,10/10/2017,City Tap House
1123,Yelp doesn't allow for separating food from service so I want to quickly say our server was great.  Not a ton of attention but he was efficient.  Beer and food came out quickly which we appreciated.  Additionally the manager walked around and checked in with tables.The food was not great.  People that got pizza liked it.  I had a caesar salad which was kind of weird - didn't taste like caesar salad and the breadcrumbs were stale or so hard I felt like I could break a tooth. One person in our party ordered pulled pork nachos and the meat on it was actually cold.  The restaurant was very dark and super loud.  I understand it's a casual environment but I don't understand why they have to be dark.   The outdoor seating area was lovely.  I would be willing to give it another go just for cocktails in the outdoor seating area.,2,10/14/2017,City Tap House
1124,"The Fort Point Channel and South Boston Waterfront is an area home to dozens of artists, the new Institute of Contemporary Arts, the newly expanded Children's Museum, MBTA's modestly rapid-transit improvement - the Silver Line, a recent huge convention center and perhaps the future (though regrettable) site for a move of Boston City Hall.  By all accounts, it is one of the hottest parts of the city to be developed in decades.The bakery and cafe, Flour, is a very good sign of the way that the community should be heading, and a welcome addition to the paucity of Fort Point Channel food offerings.  As of this writing, Flour is open on weekdays as well as Saturdays (their website says they will be open on Sundays starting in June) which points to the activation of an area which is far too quiet on the weekends.The interior is very clean and simple, and the people who work there seem to enjoy it and are very friendly, by contrast to nearly every other takeout lunch joint in town.  One feels a great sense of community from the postings on the walls, the laptop and cappucino denizens, and the respect for the building's design qualities and surroundings.From what I can tell, the food is the same as at the South End location: coffee, homemade pastries, fresh bread, soup, creative sandwiches, etc.  See that location for more information: yelp.com/biz/SvSjcS0jjnF…  ps:For this location, I would recommend one eats their lunch at a customary hour if the notable daily lunch specials are to be an option, as they often sell out on weekdays before 2:00.",5,3/12/2007,Flour Bakery + Café

1127,"UPDATE: Changing my original 4 star review to 5 stars because Flour took my advice and added egg sandwiches to their menu and they are really freaking good! *************************************************************************I am really glad this place opened up near my second home (my boyfriend's neighborhood). But, I'm a little disappointed in the breakfast options.Just pastries? No breakfast sandwiches?  I had a blueberry muffin for breakfast today and a scone the last time I went. Both were delicious but each time, I was ravenous an hour later. I need a breakfast with some protein in it. I saw they had pre-made yogurt parfaits but I don't like those - the granola gets soggy. Please Flour, I know your name means ""Refined Carbohydrate"" but can you please add some sort of egg product to your breakfast menu?  I will add that the coffee is very good. And, I have yet to try any lunch items but they also look very good.",5,3/20/2007,Flour Bakery + Café
1128,"This place is... I can't find the words. I haven't tried the sandwiches but heard they are excellent. What I'm here to talk about is the chocolate cookie with nuts and chocolate chunks.

Seriously, best cookies of my life!I do wish they were a bit faster, however -- you can get stuck in line for awhile.",5,3/26/2007,Flour Bakery + Café

I loove the industrial feel to it. This place is always packed around lunch time. They have really great vegeterain options. I loooove their dessert! I particularly love their samplers. The sandwiches are always so fresh. Humus, Tahini, Sprouts....and keylime tarts. Yum!",5,3/28/2007,Flour Bakery + Café
1130,"Flour Bakery is my favorite place on earth.  Everytime I go there I usually end up splitting/sharing because I can never just settle on one thing.  Two favorites are the roast beef, horseradish, crispy onions & tomato sandwich and the roasted lamb, tomato chutney & goat cheese sandwich.  Both priced under $7, I believe.  Both paired nicely with their raspberry seltzer.  The raspberry seltzer is so delicious, I almost wish they made it in a larger size (one size only I believe..).Last time I was in I noticed that they offer quart containers of bolognese sauce and cookie dough (clearly two seperate items) to make at home.  For dessert, I couldn't resist a macaroon.  Perfectly crunchy on the outside and sweet and yummy on the inside.  I have had the sticky buns in the past...and it was like I died and went to heaven.  Then I realized I was in heaven...Flour Bakery.",5,3/30/2007,Flour Bakery + Café
1131,"I say this place is OK. But the options are extremely limited. As far as desserts are concerned, I didn't like them all that much. The cookies are good and so are banana nut cakes. I liked the following sandwiches:1. Hummus sandwich2. Mozzarella basil/pesto/tomato3. curried tunaThe soups lack the consistency and standards of Metro cafe.I don't have much complaints about their coffee.. pretty decent.One thing though, when you're in line and you ask for coffee, they pour the coffee right away. Then you have to wait in line to pay, without being able to add milk and  sip on your coffee... it may not stay as warm as you want it to be for that long... Just a suggestion to them would be have the cashier pour the coffee... stays fresher (if they see that the line's kinda long)overall OK, just get bored by it soon.",3,4/1/2007,Flour Bakery + Café

My lemon-coconut muffin was sooooo good and my sister's blueberry muffin top? Elaine would have approved.  I finished off with a respectable espresso. A lot of what appealed to me about Flour was its ambience--airy, spacious, light wood, the chalkboard menus, the people sitting around sharing newspapers and diddling around on the interwebs. I wish we had a Flour in my neighborhood!",5,4/9/2007,Flour Bakery + Café
1133,"One of the best sandwiches I have EVER had.  (I tried the fresh mozzarella / pesto / tomato sandwich and even the bread was really delicious.)  Ingredients just dripping out of it.  The atmosphere & clientele is cool and funky (quote of the day on the blackboard-covered wall!), and although I didn't try any of the desserts they looked so appetizing it was hard to believe.  There's a big lunch rush - it's best to get there a little before noon.  Agree with Gabriella L. w/r/t the teas - this would be an amazing place to visit in the middle of the afternoon and have tea and dessert.A little kids' menu listed pb&j or grilled cheese, for something like $4.50, or milk & a cookie for $2.50 - adorable.",5,4/26/2007,Flour Bakery + Café
1134,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?This place puts out a good product: their sandwiches are tasty and ingredients high-quality, their bread is fresh and delicious (though they only have one option, which is annoying, since I like whole-wheat), and the cafe itself is cute and cozy.  Sounds great, right?  It is, HOWEVER: this is nothing spectacular, and certainly not innovative.  The chalkboard walls and the pressed sandwiches I've seen before.  Almost all of their sandwich options are pretty run-of-the-mill, and frankly, I want a little more.High quality, no doubt, but not adventurous, and that's what it takes to stick out in my mind...stop in if you want something safe--and don't bother going around 12, you'll wait for 20 minutes AFTER you order.",3,5/9/2007,Flour Bakery + Café
1135,"A friend of mine works at this location. This past weekend, my friends and I from college went to this place to check out. The cafe and bakery has a comfortable atmosphere and we were kind of surprise we weren't the only ones there (the location is sort of tucked in). There are displays of desserts such as cupcakes, tarts, meringue, etcc....the prices are average for desserts. I tried the banana nut muffin with a cream cheese frosting. Man, it was good. $2.50 for a muffin could be a little steep to this recent college graduate with no job's pocket. My friends had egg sandwiches, fruit tarts, and a turkey with cranberries..sandwich of sorts.  According to them, the fruit tarts were really good.  They said the others were average,  I guess.It's a nice place to lounge and to eat some sweets, sip coffee/tea, or munch on a sandwich on a Sunday morning or afternoon.  Prices though are not meant to be college student friendly.",3,6/11/2007,Flour Bakery + Café

1137,"Love this place!They make great, wholesome, filling sandwiches, soups and salads. The baked goods are sublime. The coffee and teas are amazing. Also recommended: The house-made raspberry seltzer, a godsend on sore-throat days. The staff are friendly, and they remember who their regulars are- It's where everybody knows my name! My only complaint is that this place tends to be rather slow- Fast food it is not. I'm not sure if this is a function of their popularity/long lines or their system for preping the food (from what I've observed, it isn't the most efficient system). If I see a long line when enter, I usually grab lunch somewhere else- some of us can't wait 20 minutes for a sandwich (If I didn't have a short 30 minute lunch break, I might, though). I go here at least once a day when I'm at work, sometimes as much as 4 times a day.  I like their food and drinks that much.",4,6/17/2007,Flour Bakery + Café

1141,"What a destination hike to find this place!  Since this is my first time to Flour Bakery, I decided to venture to the one on Farnsworth Street since it sounded like it was close to the Train station. I had to switch from Green line to Red Line to Silver Line and walked two blocks (bypassing all the construction traffic!) to get here.  Though I realized later that I could of just walked behind the parking lot and I could of avoided all the traffic.  This bakery is around a lot of office building. Maybe it's success is due to good food + not enough eateries around the ""courthouse"" area? What I ordered:Cupcake: DIVINE! Not too sweet, not too buttery, I can taste the chocolate! It was basically a chocolate cupcake with white buttercream on top but it wasn't heavy frosting type of heaviness.  Just perfect.Drink:  Homemade Rasaberry Spritzer: I didn't think anything particular of it, maybe it was just regular Rasaberry syrup?Soup:  I got the carrot and apple. It wasn't too watery, consistancy was just right.  It was a tad bit spicy too. I loved it.I did not see Joanne Chang there.A lot of construction going on in that area and they are building a new ""patio/deck"" area for patrons to sit outside in.

1142,"I've got three hardcore reasons to visit this special little find in the Fort Port area (in order of importance):(1)  The coffee.  Seriously.  You will find the best French Roast on the East Coast here.  Matter of fact, I wrote this review in .004693 seconds after drinking a small.  It's dark, strong, and, get this, full of flavor - not like those two other ""big-business"" coffee shops - rhyming with schmarbucks and schmeet's.  I implore you, go here, order the coffee, and then thank me, really fast.(2)  Bacon.  I know it's a ""bakery.""  I'm now calling it a ""baconry.""  They have the most best bacon in Boston.  It's a shame you can't order it alone - so, I usually settle for the BLT, and begrudgingly eat some very fresh vegetables and perfectly baked bread with my ""B.""  It's all smokey flavor, not salty, and not fatty.  Try it - but order two, it will save you the time of waiting in line to order another.  Trust me.  I know bacon, I live bacon, I would marry bacon if I could.(3)  Kid Friendly.  As a parent, the proximity to the Children's Museum is sweet!!!!  And the fact that they have all the highchairs and seating for a family is key.  There is enough room for my boy to throw all of his bacon around him without hitting anyone (which, by the way, I still eat - see No. 2, above); and you won't care, because the staff doesn't care!  Who thought going to the Children's Museum would be so much fun for grownups - well, it is if you eat here after.  As for my boy, there are plenty of kid-friendly foods that are healthy and yummy: fruit, bagels, simple sandwiches, bacon, bacon, and bacon.  Try the bacon.  Bacon.  Baco.  Bac.  Ba.

1143,"The new sibling of the adorable South End bakery has inherited all of the Joanne Chang charm, with a bit more Ft. Point edge.  This conversation sums up the neighborhood vibe:[8:30am, Tuesday morning]Flour employee to artistic older woman ordering seltzer:  ""Hi!  Haven't seen you in here for a while!""Woman:  ""I know!  I've missed it!  But work's been very busy.""Employee:  ""Oh really?  What do you do, if you don't mind my asking?  I like to get to know our regulars.""Woman:  ""I work in a design firm.  I get paid to play all day.""Employee:  ""Haha, sounds like us!""[Sounds from background of employees singing along in falsetto voices to classic rock song on radio.]This same employee remembered my name from two days previous, and even remembered my order (it was Oreos, in case you were wondering.  They're amazing.)  It was like we were all actors in a FedEx commercial lionizing the small business owner.  The food here is delicious - although it's a bit pricey for everyday consumption, it's a wonderful place to treat yourself or a friend (or a boss) if you've had a long day of getting paid to play.  Each person in my office seems to have their own personal favorite indulgence here, whether it's the aforementioned homemade Oreos, the seltzer-o-the-day, the spiced Chai, the tiny tartlets, the creme brulee, the raspberry crumble, or the banana bread.The Flour crown jewel, however, is Joanne Chang's famous sticky bun, which she once demo'd in this location for the Food Network, then handed out for free to all the customers who came in that day (of course we made sure to be among them).  Even if you're full after a delicious pressed sandwich or quiche-of-the-day, you should take one home for your honey - he or she will appreciate it.I liked the Flour in the South End, but I may LOVE the Flour in Ft. Point. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the lack of more veggie options for lunch -  the sandwiches and salads frequently have meat that cannot always be removed.

Their sandwiches are amazing.  My personal favorite is the Curry Tuna, but I've tried several and have never been disappointed.  The very best ones are pressed in the panini grill to toasty perfection. Also delightful is the stuffed bread--which changes daily and comes with salad, all for five bucks.2. The odds and ends are all also delicious.  Common favorites are the chocolate-chip macaroon, their seltzer of the day, and the red velvet cupcake.  Delish!3. I saw Giada de Laurentiis here!  Yep, one day I just happened to go to Flour for lunch and she was taping her show ""Weekend Getaways.""  If it's good enough for Giada, you KNOW it's good :)The only complaint I have is about their frosting.  It literally tastes like just straight butter.  But I'm not the biggest fan of frosting in the first place so maybe I'm just oversensitive.",5,10/14/2007,Flour Bakery + Café

There is so much talk of it taking forever to get your food here, I go before the rush, stand away from the line, make my selection, order and usually have what I need with in 5 minutes. When it is busy, it's a DIFFERENT story...I can't tell you how many times I have been stuck behind some jerk, ogling the goodies, saying ""hmmmmm, I just don't  know what to get.......what do you have to drink?""...It drives me crazy, read the menu, order your food like an adult, pay and move on, SOME OF US are hungry and prepared to make a quick food transaction.  I know this seems harsh but, it was like this at Metro too before Flour opened, it was a nightmare.    The coffee isn't my favorite but, I know people that love it, and I have waited far longer for far less at a Starbucks.  The food is always good, I think the posts about this place really got to me, people asking for ""more""...if you don't like it, don't go there, it will make the line much shorter for those of us that DO want to be here.  Hey vegetarians....pack a lunch, you are the minority, don't leave it up to someone else to provide you with daily sustenance.",4,12/22/2007,Flour Bakery + Café

The inside is very lofty with very high ceiling, good decor and color scheme. I don't think they have alot of option for hot breakfast food.  I got the french toast, it was tasty, but I shoulda got their bakery items!  Don't worry, I will be back again for that!

I had a bite of the sticky buns but it wasn't enough to appreciate what all the fuss is about.  Two thumbs up for serving their tea in little personal pots.  There were so many options, it all looked so good from the muffin tops to the teensie-weensie tartlets.

1157,"four stars instead of five ONLY because I have never tried the sandwiches here, but I have had the desserts and pastries too many times to count & I can tell you they are HEAVENLY!!! the sticky rolls are to die for. the tartlets are delish! the cookies and cakes are amazing. I have never had a single sweet here that I didn't love!I have always had good patient service, even when the lines were long. its best in the summer when you can sit outside. other patrons tend to be very friendly as well! great neighborhood spot in the south end.I will update my rating when I try the sandwiches!",4,2/5/2008,Flour Bakery + Café
1158,"Sticky buns. Sticky buns. Sticky buns! These are the devil's temptation every time I come here. So very good, and so very naughty. Indulgence thy name is Flour Sticky Buns. Flour is much more than sticky buns though. Nearly every pastry and dessert item I've tried has been super. I work in the neighborhood and also frequent for lunch. The roast beef, grilled portabello, and many other sandwiches are all quite divine. I will say that the line can get long during lunch, but, it's not like there are that many good lunch options in the area, so what do you expect? I've always found the staff to be pleasant, even if they are busy. The prices aren't cheap, but you're paying for homemade bread and quality ingredients. Coffee and teas are quite delicious here as well.",5,2/16/2008,Flour Bakery + Café

It was a little expensive, but the portions were large and the iced tea tasted fresh brewed.  The sandwich wasn't as good as I expected.  It was full of veggies, but didn't have much flavor and was light on the hummus.I couldn't even come close to finishing the sticky bun after eating about half the sandwich.  It was definitely sticky.  At one point a little bug flew over and landed on my pastry and got itself stuck in the gooey topping.  I let him have that part of the bun.  The sticky bun was good, but next time I'd try one of the other sweets.  I was annoyed that I saw another bug flying around the pastry case, probably a cousin of the bug who shared my sticky bun with me.  That bug seemed particularly fond of the cupcakes.I'm glad I made the trek on the T to visit Flour because I would have always wondered what it was like if I hadn't.  I just wish I had enjoyed it a little more, at least as much as the bugs did.",3,4/26/2008,Flour Bakery + Café

I DON'T KNOW.The great thing about Flour though is that I would totally do lunch here too, granted, a late lunch to avoid the crowds and my boyfriend wants to buy their breads and I'd even want to try buying a creme brulee to go as a dessert after dinner.

1169,"Flour combines bakery with cafe and succeeds in both venues.  The motto here is ""Eat Dessert First"", which may not be so hard to do at any other bakery, but is at Flour because of all of their delicious sandwich options.The homemade hummus with cucumber, red onion, and sprouts is crisp and fresh, and the grilled roast chicken is served panini-style, with brie, arugula, roasted red peppers,and caramelized onions.  While I personally have never had it, everyone that has boasts about the roast beef sandwich, especially the crispy onions with which it's laden.  No matter which sandwich you choose, be assured that the bread is always fresh.  Flour now also gives the choice of wheat bread, for those looking to be health conscious before devouring a chocolate cupcake or a handful of homemade oreo cookies.One cannot walk into Flour without wanting to try every single dessert in there.  Start with the cookies and finish with the triple chocolate mousse cake, which practically melts in your mouth.  Be sure to take some mini-tartlettes for the road.Looking for a snack?  The granola bars are a sure bet, with a cranberry-apricot-apple jam that makes them far better than any packaged brand.  The banana bread is also sure to impress; it is dense, moist, and has a vibrant banana flavor.Try to visit Flour during off-hours.  The staff is always pleasant, but it can get insanely busy in there, with lines stretching to the door and beyond.",4,5/7/2008,Flour Bakery + Café
1170,"I am this bakery's biggest fan! Flour is a local gem, offering lots of neighborhood flair and one of the few places that really does meet up to all the hype. When I was a human slave... errr, graduate student, each member in our research group took turns providing refreshments at our weekly morning status meetings, a task that I always approached with glee since it gave me a chance to sample as many different breakfast pastry offerings as my advisor's wallet could withstand. So, after several years of meetings and countless pastry samplings later, I've found that the best stuff on the menu are:1) granola bar ($2.50): full of sunflower seeds, a medley of dried fruits, coconut, and just the right amount of moistness. 2) sour cream coffee cake ($2.50): not too sweet, excellent streusel containing ground almonds.3) lemon raspberry cake ($5): the perfect balance of tart and sweet. 4) fruit tart ($5): best with the occasional sprinkling of persimmon seeds and the crust is perfectly toothsome.5) sticky bun ($2.50): buttery, yeasty, scrumptious dough covered in a super gooey caramelized glaze... heaven!However, if you can only get one item, get the hot chocolate ($3); the barista melts dark Scharffenberger chocolate and mixes the ganache into the milk, which she then steams to create a heavenly frothy creation. I've never been able to find anything like it on the west coast!

Don't even get me started on the pastries. The sticky buns are OK to me - but my wife loves them. You have to try the pop tarts. The quiche is so good that all real men should eat it.Their coffee could be better, but they have a wide selection of teas, and this is only a small quibble.They're also friendly and courteous, which is greatly refreshing for New England.The menu is the same as the South End location, but there's more space here.

1180,"Food (10/10) = Ubelievable!  Like other Yelpers, I first found out about Flour Bakery from FoodTV's ""Throwdown with Bobby Flay.""  In one episode, Bobby Flay challenges Joanne Chang to a ""sticky bun throwdown.""  Joanne's sticky buns won, and I can understand why.  These buns are absolutely amazing!  The brioche bun is heavenly moist and soft.  Crushed pecans are added to the brioche before being rolled up and cut to pieces for baking, so that each bite contains that crunchy pecan goodness.  The caramel ""goo"" syrup covering the tops of each bun completes this savory sticky indulgence.  Whether or not you are a fan of sticky buns, Flour Bakery's sticky buns are a must try!Although Flour Bakery may now be famous for their sticky buns, they truly excel in other delightful treats.If you are a fan of banana bread like I am, you must sink your teeth into Flour Bakery's moist banana bread filled with walnuts!The cinnamon cream brioche is brioche topped with creme fraiche and cinnamon sugar.  It looks similar to a danish, but in no way does it compare to Flour Bakery's cinammon creame brioche.Although the brioche au chocolat may be my least favorite, it is still delicious.  I felt that the brioche was a bit dry and the ratio of brioche to chocolate was high.  Since I've only ordered this once, maybe I just got a ""bad"" one.  That said, I wll certainly give it another try.The meringue cloud is a chewy airy sweet treat filled with chocolate or almonds.  Although I've had better meringue clouds, Flour Bakery does a very good job in making them.The sandwiches are a bit pricey, but it is totally worth every thing you pay for.  The bread is seasoned with a blend of herbs and spices making every bite sensational.  Although I've only had one of their sandwiches (Roasted lamb, tomato chutney, and goat cheese), I am willing to bet that all of the other sandwiches are just as good or better.  The sandwiches I plan to try next are the ""curried tuna salad, apples, carrots, golden raisins"" and the ""grilled portobello melt, pesto, mozzarella, and tomatos.""Service (10/10) = The people who work here are full of energy and cheerful.  Their cheerfulness certainly goes a long way in terms of making the customers feel welcome, happy and satisfied.  If you really want to get sticky buns, you can call in ahead of time and have them hold some for you.  Actually, since the sticky buns are so popular, I suggest you do so.  The first time I went to Flour Bakery, they were sold out at 10 AM.  I was so disappointed, and did not have the time to wait for the next batch.  Before going back the second time, I made sure I would get my sticky buns by calling in to reserve some. Ambiance (9/10) = The place is very clean and spacious.  Tables are spaced out nicely and the baked goods are displayed beautifully.  I really like how their menu is written on a chalk board, giving the place somewhat of a homey and neighborhood friendly feeling.Overall Opinion = If I lived a lot closer to Flour Bakery, for sure I would get hella fat!  I just finished competing in a bodybuilding competition, and Flour Bakery is already doing a pretty good job of fattening me up.  This place is just absolutely amazing and I wish I could come here every morning for one or two baked pastries and a nice cup of hot coffee.  I also find it funny that there's an Au Bon Pain (ABP) around the corner.  Why the hell would anyone go to ABP over Flour Bakery?!",5,7/9/2008,Flour Bakery + Café

SECOND BEST HERE!The Portobella Mushroom, Tomato, and Pesto sandwich is also yummy. THIRD BEST HERE!The rest are all decent:I had the curried tuna sandwich once. That was good, but not something I can order a lot.I tried the smoked turkey, vermont cheddar & cranberry chutney sandwich once as well. I was not impressed. I rather make my own thanksgiving inspired sandwich at home. It would taste better. I found this sandwich to be very bland.The homemade hummus, cucumber, red onion, sprouts sandwich is okay. I was still starving after I ate it. I do not find this as a filling lunch.The roast chicken, avocado & jicama is okay. I was expecting to really like this, but found out that I don't like jicama. If you like jicama, then you might like this.The roast beef, horseradish, crispy onions & tomato was so-so. I had it once, but was not that impressed. I can see how others might love this.The roasted lamb, tomato chutney & goat cheese was not my cup of tea. I found this nauseating, however one of my friends LOVES this sandwich. She has good taste in food, but I think the lamb sandwich was just a little too glutenous for me.The grilled roast chicken, brie, arugula, roasted red peppers & caramelized onions is pretty decent. I've had this a few times.The pizza is good, but a small size.I've tried a few soups here which were all good.Their stuffed bread is wicked good. I'm not a fan when they have turkey or chicken, but I've had meatball stuffed bread here before and it was amazing. Their salad is basically greens and tons of dressing. I would skip over ordering this.I haven't tried the meals/dinners of the day or side specials yet.I like their sweets. The chocolate chip cookie and double chocolate are pretty good. However, I prefer my homemade cookies more. The banana bread is really good - especially with a nice cup of coffee. I tried the sticky bun today. It was good, but nothing to write home about. I do not like their oreo impression cookie. I bought a few once and took them home with me. I found out they were hard and tasteless. I had their breakfast sandwich once, but I did not like it.

Gross.At any rate, Flour is a god send to the Fort Point neighborhood.  The dark roast is the best coffee I've had in Boston--I wake up thinking about it on a regular basis...and I'm usually in a very sour mood until I get it (despite how many cups of office coffee i have).  I tend to avoid going during the lunch hour, because it's one of the few good places to get a quick bite in the area...but I've learned to adapt (and save some $$ in the process), as I tend to find my mid morning/mid afternoon snack in their bakery selection: The brioche is to die for, the stick buns have sent me to the dentist--but Bobby Flay does not lie, they are awesome, and the biscotti (from a girl who is usually less than impressed by such a dessert) is a welcome addition to my dark roast (with a pump of hazelnut, yummy!).I've yet to meet a sandwich I don't like here--but I would strongly recommend waiting until 2 or 3 to get one--as they are usually much better once the rush is over--and you can skip the stress of the line/crowd.The folks who keep this place running each day are a fabulous bunch.  Not once have I encountered bad service--perhaps slow, but that comes with the rush as a popular bakery!!  Just thinking about the BLT is making me hungry....",5,8/28/2008,Flour Bakery + Café

Warm and wonderful. The pastry was great too. Good texture, flavor, sweetness, size.Cost: $27 for breakfast for two. Not cheap, but the value was there.Would I go back: absolutely, in a heartbeat. I remember when Joanne Chang first opened it up - dessert and catering was the focus. But this? I like this much better. The cafe has really come of age - in a good way. And the staff is really sweet and helpful.What I would change: line management on busy mornings. There's got to be a better way of managing that line. Also - our sandwiches were ready but we couldn't hear our name being called as it was very loud in the shop. Ah well. Time to get our ears cleaned.The bread here has NOTHING on the stuff coming out of B&R Artisan Bread in Framingham.

1192,"My boyfriend and I came here one evening before going to the Children's Museum.  We ordered the portobello pesto sandwich.  I also got a cider and a brownie.The sandwich was delightful.  The pesto could have used more garlic, but overall it was a well balanced sandwich.  It was warm, the bread was amazing, and the cheese was ooey gooey.  They only had a little bit of mulled apple cider left, so my cup was mostly filled with plain cider (they only charged me for a soda since they ran out of mulled cider).  I could still taste the spices, and this was a wonderful treat.  I ate the brownie the next day while I was in a bad mood (writing about Kant will do that to a person), and it had a chewy, chocolate-y texture that almost made me love Kant.  Those brownies are powerful.",4,10/21/2008,Flour Bakery + Café
1193,"This café has very small signage - finding this place without having coffee is not a treat. Once inside the confusion didn't end for me, before or after coffee, and then again for lunch (my dad really liked the food). The signs have a few lists of sandwiches - but they don't really explain which are pressed and which are not - mmm, I was not so happy to find out later mine was an my dad's wasn't. I got him a sandwich that had turkey (smoked?) it was on the large side and he said it was tasty. I got one with what I thought was roasted chicken and would be a cold sandwich - it was pressed with arugela (sp?) and cheese which when warmed tasted a little bit more like soap than anything else. The line and ordering process has the look of being overly structured, yet still has something missing - what's the word... ORDER. It took way too long for me to get my sandwiches - the lunch rush had to be over - it was a holiday, but it was a bit after 3pm. I stood listening to the girls talk about hanging out with their boyfriends while they made all the sandwiches slowly. No bag for my sandwiches, no tray for my coffees. Service was short and slightly snippy upon ordering and being rung up. I don't care where the café is located, what the prices are, or how busy the place is - the employees should be able to do their job without taking it out on the customer. I mean this in the most understanding way; I have worked in many a coffee shop. I will not be returning here.",1,10/27/2008,Flour Bakery + Café
1194,"I'll admit it, I've been known to watch a little ""Throwdown with Bobby Flay"" every once in a while.  One episode seems to have stuck with me, Flour Bakery  in Boston and their Sticky Buns.  I remember watching this episode and drooling all over myself as I watched these massive Sticky Buns being created and consumed...Bobby Flay lost this throwdown, and for good reason, these Sticky Buns are beyond amazing!  After arriving in Boston last week, the first thing we did after leaving the airport was head over to Flour to get some of these buns we had been craving for MONTHS.  They were huge, they were sticky and they were amazingly delicious.  The best part of the Sticky Bun was the thick caramelly topping that soaked deep into the buttery dough.I wish I had tried more items, but alas I only had the Sticky Bun and I've since returned to California.  I am now officially searching for a Sticky Bun equivalent in San Francisco...if you know of a winner, please let me know...",5,10/28/2008,Flour Bakery + Café
1195,"The first time I went to flour, I got a sandwich that was dense, flavorless, and expensive served by someone who seemed like they could not be bothered... so needless to say it took a while for me to return.BUT I DID. I have to say that that first time must've been an off day because every time since (about 4 or 5 times over the last few months) I have always receieved gracious and friendly service. Much better coffee than the Metro around the corner, and the bakery treats are absolutely phenomenal... I am a huge fan of the banana bread!Still not a fan of the sandwiches, though.",4,11/8/2008,Flour Bakery + Café
1196,"Four stars for the food. (Sticky buns are beyond sinful - and worth it.) Great for an afternoon latte and snack. Great cookies, and good sandwiches (if you don't mind a wait). Lattes used to be my favorite treat here, but have gotten spotty with lots of new faces behind the counter.If you factor in the inefficient lunchtime wait, Flour goes down to 3 stars. When Flour first moved to the area, it was an answered prayer. A good sandwich selection, fresh pastries, and coffee were a huge need in the area. The food is still solid, but if you expect to get a sandwich at lunch, be prepared to wait over 1/2 an hour from line to delivery. With affordable coffees and pastries at Barbara Lynch's Sportello (just around the corner), Flour will need to step back up to 4 stars!",3,11/16/2008,Flour Bakery + Café
1197,"I'm making a rum raisin bread pudding for Thanksgiving. My recipe calls for brioche, but there was no brioche at Shaw's, so I just picked up a loaf of basic French bread. Ingredients: flour, yeast, salt. No butter or eggs. Today at work I started to worry my pudding would not be good. Yelp helped me find Flour Bakery near South Station, a minor detour on my way home.It is the real deal. I picked up a fancypants brioche for $7. It smells like a fresh baked croissant. I wanted to press my nose up against it all the way to the register. Flour also makes tantalizing pastries, sandwiches and soups, with plenty of seating for lunch. The servers were really nice yet efficient, even on the day before Thanksgiving when all of Boston wants its baked goods. I strategically bought two cranberry pecan rolls so I wouldn't eat my brioche before it became pudding. These I meant to share with my boyfriend, but I had eaten both of these divine buns before I got to South Station. I can't wait to go back like 700 more times.Update: I went back. Most amazing breakfast sandwich. Fluffy egg, bacon or ham, cheese, greens, tomato and special sauce (like hollandaise) on a quality bun. Just get it. You won't be sorry.",5,11/26/2008,Flour Bakery + Café

My Mom did drop me off and yes, I am 27 years old. You got a problem with that? I didn't think so. Where was I? Oh yes, sooo if you are driving to this lovely little bakery, please note, it's on a 1-way street but the coffee and the beautiful, little organic pastry case are well worth it. I got a large coffee and finished every last drop. We were also there long enough to see lunch roll in and I couldn't help but eye the sandwiches and salads. I kept interrupting Leighann with my nose in the air saying, ""Is that bacon? I smell bacon."" It was bacon, but alas, I didn't get any.

1201,"This review is for their roast beef sandwich, which is the only menu item of theirs that I've eaten. It is, without a doubt, the best roast beef sandwich I have ever had - so good, in fact, that I'm considering planning my week around when I should go to Flour and get one; I'm thinking every Monday, Wednesday and Friday for as long as I'm working nearby.Their website simply describes the sandwich as roast beef with horseradish, crispy onions & tomato, but that's selling it short. First of all, the meat is incredibly rare, so much so that it was a shade of red I'd never really seen on roast beef. The ""horseradish"" is really a sauce that can be described with the following adjectives: tangy, zippy, piquant, zesty, savory. The crispy onions are the French-fried kind that usually go on a green bean casserole (trust me, it works perfectly). The tomato is adequate. All of these ingredients are sandwiched between two slices of freshly baked wheat bread that is good in and of itself.Anyway, their roast beef sandwich is very good.",5,12/20/2008,Flour Bakery + Café
1202,the cookies here are ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. they are so perfect... super gooey in the middle and crispy-ish on the outside. you're on anti-cookie drugs if you don't like these cookies.,5,12/21/2008,Flour Bakery + Café
1203,"I love this place for so many reasons...where do I start....  thanks to my buddy kp who turned me on to the place.firstly - it's a funky little artsy place -- gorgeous on the inside -- just cosy, inviting -- maybe it's that loft-style+exposed brick+ high ceiling+stainless steel fittings+track lights -- that's just the right combination to make it feel warm, cosy, like a christmas day in front of a fire (minus the fireplace, in this case....)and -- it's owned by young Asian American woman entrepreneur - you go sistah-girlll! who found her niche in taste and style.and, of course most importantly -- their home-made bakery yummies -- are just sinfully good! I haven't tried everything yet -- they all look SOOO inviting -- but have been drawn to some of my favorites -- the chocolate hazelnut cookie which in unsurpassed -- just crispy enough on the outside and very slightly, just v.e.r.y slightly gooey along with the melted tasting chocolate (I don't like cookie dough, soft cookies, at all -- only like the crispy, crunchy - not rock hard, tho' kind), the triple baked brioche, the sugar brioche, and everything else (and there are lots of unusual little items) look equally inviting.When I've been here for lunch -- I usually get the Roast Lamb sandwich, which comes with a mango/cranberry? chutney and spring greens and goat cheese. Just a perfect combination that hits the right spot for me.Lots of nice teas to choose from...Wish they had wireless there -- but understand why they probably don't -- cos the lines always winding out the door from later morning through past lunch -- so I imagine it's a space saving measure to keep people from turning this into their second home/office....Yay for Flour!! -- at least Boston is not TOTALLY hopeless -- when it comes to interesting and beautiful cafes with delicious goodies....",5,12/25/2008,Flour Bakery + Café

1205,"What a fab place! Forget about the endless back and forth concerning the best bakery in the North End (although, I do favor Modern Pastry over Mike's). This IS the best bakery/cafe in Boston. Their baked goods are delectable, fresh, and original. Their take on the old fashioned Oreo is especially delicious. Their soups, salads and sandwiches make tasty treats for lunch.

I've never been disappointed with Flour, and I always seem to leave the place happier than when I arrived. The dinner options are delicious too. The service is cheery, accommodating and knowledgeable. I suspect they are asked ""what's good?"" constantly, so it's good to note that the staff seems to have low turnover which ensures that they're well versed in the assortment of goods. The people working the register and the sandwich counter maintain their composure even when the line gets long during peak lunch hours.

1216,"I used to work down the street from this location, and there were only 2 things that kept me from going there on a daily basis: the prices (not unwarranted, given the quality- but a little steep nonetheless), and the extremely loooong line at lunchtime.  My 2 favorite things: the sandwich with grilled chicken, arugula, brie, roasted red peppers, and caramelized onions and the sandwich with roasted lamb and tomato chutney.  (Wipes drool from corner of mouth...)I also recommend trying the homemade flavored seltzers. On my last visit they had a raspberry mint, which was fruity and refreshing.  The soups are also delish- I had some sort of roasted pumpkin one a while back that was to die for.On their baked goods...I'm not quiet as sold.  My favorite is their homemade Oreos.  I think their chocolate chip cookies are a little dry, and the coffee cake is okay, but nothing I'd go back for.  The bread on the other hand, is absolutely perfect: crusty on the outside and tender and chewy on the inside.For all you fellow Food Network fans, this is a heavily visited spot. Bobby Flay showed up for a sticky bun throwdown, and Giada filmed an episode of her weekend travel show here.  (I actually witnessed them taping a segment...she's even more tiny and adorable in person!)",4,3/12/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

1218,OMIGOD!  I tried Flour for the first time today thinking I was in for a bakery treat.  Serendipity was my partner today as I found the best chicken soup of my life.  Now that was totally unexpected.  I love chicken soup and I love lentils.  Now I am experiencing nirvana.  Is that a little extreme?  Not the way I felt today.  And the chocolate chip cookie was also the best ever.  Line? Yes.  Why? Fabulous.  I will be back!  Maybe it will be today for some soup to take home along with a couple more cookies.  Keep it up!!,5,3/25/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

1220,"I honestly wasn't that impressed with Flour. The baked goods were really good and there are obviously a ton of people who love this place because of it.

1225,"You are so delicious, Flour. Slightly overpriced but delicious!I've been here twice and both times, I felt the need to get enough sweets for a week. Their sticky buns are amazing and obviously beat Bobby Flay. The lemon poppyseed muffins are a little crumbly but still good. They aren't too sweet or too dry. The meringues are decent but I didn't love the toasted almonds. I should have opted for the chocolate chip. Finally, the reason this place gets 5 stars is the egg sandwich. I adore egg sandwiches because I can sneak protein into a carb-cheese fest. They make their egg sandwiches on great bread with EGG SOUFLE! Seriously, they class it up even further with a thick slice of tomato, some greens, and this amazing mustard sauce. The rest of the sandwiches are pricey ($7-9 is what I saw) but the egg sandwich is only around $5. Plus, if they cut it in half, you can attempt to save half. They do reheat well but I usually just devore it.I don't love their beverages but I have only had an ice tea because things are pretty pricey here. The parking is terrible and there aren't a lot of options. It's easier to walk from the financial district. The biggest downside is the hipster staff. They aren't helpful/clear when you ask questions about the food and the ordering line can be confusing.",5,4/13/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

Roast beef with horseradish spread and portabella salad sandwiches are a great additions to their extensive lunch/dessert menu. With two locations, I enjoy spending time at the waterfront more than the Washington Street location.  Both menus are quite similar but the south end one doesn't have as many variety as the one at the wharf.  Just thinking about their bread pudding is making me drool.",4,4/13/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

They have a good variety of sandwiches and baked good, which all look so good I have a hard time deciding which to try whenever I go there. The grilled portobello melt is my absolute favorite sandwich at Flour, but the roast beef with horseradish sauce is a close second.There's still so many baked goods that I've yet to try there, but the oreos, chocolate chip cookies, and apple streudal coffee cake are delicious.There aren't that many great bakeries in Boston, but this is one worth trying.",5,4/19/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1228,I love the concept of this place. Inside its very unique. A good option if your looking for something different. I had a hard time finding it. The street doesn't have an normal green sign but one painted in brown and white that says Farnsworth. When your looking for a green city sign its hard to notice. I was in there early Sunday afternoon. The line was a little confusing. If your just getting stuff out of the pastry area you still have to wait in line behind a ton of people who still need to order their full lunch. Then the place to wait to pick your food up is a foot over so it still looks like they are in line confusing the staff taking the next order. Anyways 20 min later another person came out from the back to help out and I was able to give him my pastry order and go right up to pay bypassing the people who had a gazillion questions. I was looking for cupcakes and they only had chocolate. I got one of those and a Belgium chocolate brownie. The cupcakes and brownies were large priced at $2.75. By the way the guy packed the cupcake the frosting got deflated in the bag. So I had to deal with a mess before I even took a bite. I thought it would be better. The whole cupcake had a very nutty flavor. I wasn't really a fan. No dryness problems but just an odd taste. The frosting was like whipped creme. All together it was average. The Belgium chocolate brownie was very rich. It was more like a flour-less chocolate cake. I ate half and couldn't go any further. I saw some other desserts like mini creme brulees I would go back for. I would also like to try their famous sticky buns after reading the other reviews. The lunch options looked healthy. I plan to give it a shot and see how that goes.,3,4/20/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

1232,"A list of things in favor of Flour's south boston location- be forwarned, as with any exceptional baked goods there is an element of rated-R'ness to the experience.1. I gained 7 pounds this winter.  This in itself is not necessarily a good thing, but it is a testament to my Lack Of Willpower that washes over me when I stand in front of the sneeze/drool guard glass and see the *sugar sparkled brioche that pull apart into individual triangle devine donut like bits, that, i kid you not, melt in your mouth*cheddar scallion scones that are a salty lunchy treat*oreos which have all the crunch and cream of a real oreo but with a chocolate cookie that tastes deep and dark and satisfying like the best icecream sandwich cookie you've ever had*sticky, coconut stringalicous macaroons2. Really quality sandwiches, especially the grilled ones, that ooze filling.  They've had an especially tasty salmon special a once or twice and put a nice avocado spread stuff on other sandwiches. They are worth every cent of overpricedness.2.5 not quite a lunch thing, but the egg sandwich in the am has a thickness and a saltyness to it that is downright decadent. It was so tasty and at the same time seemed like it might be comfortable to sit on.3. Rightous soups.  Sometimes they overdo the non-veg options, but when they veg it out, they so do it right.  Squash soup with coconut milk? OMFG.  I wanted to dribble it on some of my body parts. They even make leek soup stimulating (in an ""I'm feeling things in other parts of my body while it lolls around my tongue"" way).4. Really cute sineage.  I like the font-ing.4.5 coathooks under the tall tables, if it served alcohol, this alone would make it the bestI do have to be honest and say that I do not even try to go in there during peak lunch times week-days, the lines are out the door with a funky combo of yuppie parents and overstimulated children (Children's Museum is within hazlenut chocolate chip tossing distance) and creatively work-clothed but not-quite-suitsy neighborhood workers.  Mornings and off lunch hours make for a delightful visit.",5,4/30/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1233,"I had the most rocking day and I think it might have something to do with the fact that it all began here.  Thats right, Flour bakery and Cafe lead me on the path to success.  Allow me to elaborate.It was Sunday morning, Benny was hungover with a friend visiting from out of town.  She may or maynot have been the motivation for this drinking to excess.  We had plans for Sunday that were larger then life, sticky buns + java from Flour, a quick juant over to the ICA to scope the new Shepard Fairy exhibit, then head over to Puma city for some drinks on the deck.So we park around the corner and walk over to Flour.  I was blown away.  It wasn't as I remembered it from Throwdown with Bobby Flay.  I liked it a lot better in person than on TV.  I mean the smell was out of this world.  I really liked the layout.  The giant chalkboards with all the freshies listed was very helpfukl since my vision was still a little distored from the night prior.  All the people working the counter we're super friendly.  They had panini presses going, there were giant cakes being rolled out and there they were... I saw them clearly through all the people, coffee and confections flying all aboutr.  They were extra shiney, smelled of the cinnonmin and butter, they were a little gift from God. The sticky buns.  I ordered a latte and a stickey bun and my out of town friend did the same.  We split one and saved the other for later. I can honestly say that these sticky buns were sheer bliss.  i want one right now.  The coffee was good but the Sticky, ickey ickey was down right fabulous.  The exhibit + Puma City  Rocked, but wouldnt have rocked as hard if I wasn't high on butter and sugar from that sticky icky.  Thanks Flour for bringing me smiles through your awesome baked goodness.",5,5/11/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1234,"Flour is really, really overpriced.  SOOOO overpriced.  I've been going there for awhile now as I work nearby and I've gotten to the point where I'm sick of paying a ton for their limited offerings.  While the food is decent, and probably better than most places around, it's nothing to write home about.  Also, while the staff is friendly, they often get things wrong or get orders mixed up so that the first person to order winds up waiting for 20 minutes for one drink.  I do love their Roobois iced latte though.",2,5/12/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1235,"My favorite bakery in the city!  The staff is always friendly and the food is great.  My favorite is the BLT with applewood smoked bacon, though I recently discovered that I think they could have the best egg breakfast sandwich I have ever had, too.  The only thing is that they are a little pricey and its hard to find a table during busy times (is it just me or do the same people dominate the bakery every morning??).",4,5/26/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1236,"I'm not from the area, but a friend suggested that I stop by Flour before leaving Boston.  I'm really glad that she recommended this bakery because they have good sandwiches AND desserts.  We went during lunchtime, which seems to be their busiest because the line was out the door.  It took a while to order and to get my food, but it was worth the wait.I had the BLT with applewood smoked bacon, which was delicious.  The wheat bread was super fresh because it's baked daily.  The sandwich had just the right amount of bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. For dessert, we tried the oreo.  This was sooo good, the best oreo I've ever had for sure.  The cream squeezes out as soon as you take a bite, and the cookie part just crumbles in your mouth.  The sticky sticky bun was also tasty--it wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be, which was a good thing.  Great lunch spot for sure!",4,6/11/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1237,"Ok, so I need to preface this with: yes, I understand the name of the place is ""flour"".There are more flours than wheat flouer out there. I have celiac disease and can't have gluten (read: huge pain in the you know what). I also work in the area and it is very difficult to get lunch when I forget my lunch, without getting posioned and winding up sick for the week.I've been into this Flour several times to get lunch b/c they have really amazing vegetarian dishes there that shouldn't in my opinion require any kind of flour or gluten in them and really really amazing homemade raspberry seltzer... which if I find out it has gluten in it... I may consider throwing myself in the channel. Today and and again about a week ago, I went in to grab lunch, (which is $12 mind you) and asked if it was gluten free... expecting a yes. The server came and back and said that they didn't know what was in it and that I couldn't have it. I asked her what could possibly be in it that had gluten and she said that they use bread to thicken.... QUINOA.... if you've ever made Quinoa.... you'd know that this sounds crazy. She then immediately offered me a delicious tofu sandwich on wheat bread. So, the question is... why am I trusting these people to tell me if this dish is gluten free b/c clearly they have no idea what that means. I've contacted them with e-mail asking if they could make their ingrediants clearer on the label and to maybe try cornstarch to thicken a sauce instead of flour (which makes almost no difference in taste if you do it right). I've also asked that they have a list of what does/ doesn't have gluten it. If you're lucky enough not to have a food allergy... then all I have to say is.... go here and eat lots of pastries and of course get a seltzer b/c the food is amazing!!",1,6/12/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1238,"OMG, seriously delicious!  Flour's ginger lemonade on a hot day is just about as good as it gets.  I also had the roast beef sandwich, every part of which is perfect:  Amazing freshly-baked bread, tons of tender roast beef, horseradish sauce, crispy fried onions, and roasted tomatoes.  I was in heaven.  Yes, the space is small and the wait can be long, but it's so worth it.  And if the weather is nice, there are a fair amount of little tables outside.",5,6/15/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1239,"Two of my friends used to live by Flour in the South End and now live by this Flour location.  We went here for breakfast both days when I was in town and it was sooo yummy.  I had the egg sandwich both days but also tried the french toast which was PERFECTLY moist and the raspberry pop tart.  I like this location more than the one in the South End because it is much larger and has outdoor seating.  Also it is conveniently around the corner from their new place so a craving for something sweet can be fulfilled almost instantly.  In the words of yelp, yay! I'm a fan!",4,6/15/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1240,"I figure if I'm going to start reviewing places I go I'm going to have to have some sort of standard rating system.  So introducing for the first time ever MySO 90028160 (well because I came up with it today!).  Okay, so I'm a bit of a geek. In the order of importance:Taste (8.5):  I may have to consider breaking this down into their baked goods and the café items.For their baked goods I give them a resounding 10 for taste.  I have tired their signature sticky bun and honestly they are to die for.  They have a subtle butterscotch-y taste to it that make them unique tasting.  Also they are fairly large so if you bring your honey with you can share 1 sticky bun and still be very satisfied.  I have also tried their oatmeal cookie (I am somewhat of an oatmeal cookie expert as I like them almost as much as I like ice cream) and I will say that they are unequivocally my favorite oatmeal cookie to date; and for $1.50 it's a 'bah-gen'.I would love to give Flour, the Café, (paragraph above is for Flour, the Bakery) a higher mark but for now, I will re-assess after I've try a few other lunch items, I will say they are a 7.  In all fairness I have only tried their smoked turkey sandwich, which was very good.  However, they were a little heavy on their Vermont Cheddar for my taste; it was more a Vermont Cheddar sandwich with some smoked turkey.  On a very positive note their cranberry chutney was perfect; a perfect amount of tartness mix with just enough sweetness.  This actually surprised me as I prefer (to be read as LOVE) canned cranberry sauce, for no other reason than it's sweeter than the alternative, and scoff at real cranberry sauce when it's served on turkey day.Freshness (10):  It's a bakery/café.  The baked goods are fresh!!!  Their sticky buns are made in 2 batches.  The 4AM batch and their 2PM batch; they run out so try to get there as close to when the batches come out as you can.  If they are out and that's what you were there for take the opportunity to try their other wonderful baked selections. Portions (9):  There is not much to say except that the lunch left me contently full and I usually can eat a ton.  Oh, also, like I said earlier their sticky buns are large enough to share if you're in a sharing mood.Variety (8):  I have only been to 2 other bakeries (Clear Flour in Allston and Great Harvest in Beverly) and Flour's baked goods selection may have been a little thinner than the others but... did I mention the sticky buns; they are to die for.   In all seriousness their selection for both their baked goods and lunch/dinner is wide enough for even those that like mixing it up.Cleanliness (10):  I wish my kitchen and dining area was as clean as their's; and I don't even have any people coming in and out of my house.Cost (7): Almost $8 dollars for a sandwich seems a bit steep for the budget conscious.  With a beverage and dessert my meal ran about $13.  It's definitely reasonably priced but, at least for me, it's not some place I would be able to go on a daily basis.""People watch-ability"" (8):  From the looks of it the professionals, the outdoor-sey, the artsy, and even the tourist frequent this place.  It's not like sitting at an outdoor café on Newbury St. watching people walk by but if you enjoy seeing an assortment people, and catching snippets of interesting conversations I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.Intangibles (9):  I am not a gung-ho, evangelist when it come to the ""Green"" movement but I try to do my part; and so does Flour Bakery and Café.  I believe they are even a ""Certified Green Restaurant""!Okay, this review was a bit long winded.  I think I'll have to modify my rating system; it's an organic process, but I'll get there.Hopefully I'll get a little bit more time to Yelp as I re-invigorate my favorite past-time of trying out new restaurants every month.",4,6/18/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1241,"I like this Flour location even more so than my South End hood's.  A nice little patio and plenty of seating space inside make this a must.  I still always eye their chocolate cupcakes and ginger cookies with envy.  The roasted lamb sandwich with chutney and goat cheese will always be a favorite and their quiches are made right.  Also, the staff is super friendly, hard working and fast.  Perfect place for the flowering Seaport neighborhood!",5,6/19/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1242,"Flour makes my workday/life about 50,000 times better. I work in Fort Point and can't even remember what I used to do for lunch before Flour opened up a few years ago. Honestly, everything is delicious, but here are a few of my favorite things:-The soup specials. Omg, a different vegan soup everyday. What a dream! -The pizza specials. Brie with pears and walnuts, are you serious? A+-The bread. So soft and delicious, unbelievable!-The tea selection. Crimson berry/chamomile mix is the best on a rainy day.-The iced yerba mate latte. What! So good!Flour is awesome too  because in May I was on a trash-free challenge (i.e. I wasn't allowed to produce any garbage) and I could count on Flour for a trash free lunch everyday. I also heard that they're going to start composting which is even more awesome. So, thanks for the delicious, vegan friendly, eco-conscious lunches Flour!

1245,"Yelp knows this place is amazing, so I'll keep this short and sweet.As a visitor from Atlanta, I am quite envious of Bostonians' ability to visit Flour whenever they want. If I could, I'd probably eat lunch their every day. All their sandwiches sound delicious, and the one I had, a roasted lamb and goat cheese sandwich, was my favorite meal on my week-long road trip through New England. The lunch line can take a little while, so Flour conveniently offers a mouthwatering array of sweets to whet your appetite while you wait. I tried the lime cornbread cookie (amazing) and the almond meringue (OK). My sandwich was fantastic, with all the flavors and textures working together perfectly. As others have mentioned, Flour is also a good people watching place.

I was intrigued. I watch these shows with skepticism but I trusted my friend's tastebuds.  Well, I was not disappointed.  I had a strawberry banana muffin and it was the moistest  :) muffin I've ever had.  It was not too sweet, just tasted of fresh strawberries.  The coffee was good.  The lunch menu sounded really good but the smell from the other customer's lunch plates wafting by made me want to go back for lunch next time I am in Boston...",4,7/7/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1249,"I've never been here before, but I tried the recipe from Flour for its Banana Nut Loaf from foodnetwork.com, and it was delicious!

1250,"Needing to satisfy my tremendous hankering for sweets after lunch, I decided to trudge my way through the dismal rain over to Flour since I was already down in Southie.  Boy, was I not disappointed!  I loved the assorted array of beautiful pastries and baked goods that tantalized my eyes.  Everything from savory to sweet to tart just made my gleeful appetite reemerge from its earlier food coma.  I was in the perfect place. I ordered the fruit poptart, sticky bun, chocolate cupcake and oreo cookie.  No, it wasn't all for me.  My friend ate the oreo cookie.  Geesh.  The sticky bun was way sticky and insanely yummy - just the way it's supposed to be.  The cupcake was solid, but not great.  The same goes with the cookie.  It was good but the cookie was a bit too hard.  The poptart, however, was by far the best of the bunch.  It was flaky, buttery, sugary and oozed with some of the tastiest raspberry filling.  Mmm.  Heavenly.  Flour...I love you.",4,7/9/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1251,"Clearly I'm in the minority...this Flour is a dud. The service is excruciatingly slow, the behind the counter folks are very sweet but seem so checked out completely unaware of just how loooong the line grows.  Also, I will be pelted w sticky buns for saying this but there is WAY TOO much sugar.  The sweet stuff is almost crudely sweet, so much of it would be perfect w/o the addition of giant chunks of sugar or drowned in powdered sugar...enough already...have some class!  The worst part is that at many (if not most) times of the day it's a virtual day care center while parents try to have a moment w coffee all the kids want to get to the Children's Museum. I have found some decent treats there and the right time to visit before it turns into a day care but overall just making better food is all I ask. It's too bad, it could be such a great place but it's not.",2,7/15/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1252,"My initial visit to Flour was a big disappointment. Between the no stroller policy and the fact that they were out of sticky buns...it was one big downer. I ended up getting a few different pastries to try and both were over priced and underwhelming.  I had driven from the south shore while on maternity leave and to have to take the stroller back to the car and lug the infant carrier in was a big hassle.  I do understand why businesses have that policy, but it can be enforced in a more polite way than the condescending employee who greeted me on that first visit. THAT ASIDE. I really wanted to try the sticky buns so I returned to the Farnsworth Ave location near the boston children's museum. I was happy to see that there was no stroller ban AND they had sticky buns. I'm hooked. I've always said, I can put up with a little attitude and even some bad service for some REALLY good food. The sticky buns are that item on their menu that will make me suck it up & suffer a little in order to indulge. Looking forward to getting more soon. I live on the south shore so haven't had the opportunity to try their lunches, etc. I'm usually on a sticky bun mission...but for those alone, I'm going to have to go with the 5 stars. Tender. Chewy without being stick-to-your-teeth gummy. I don't know how they do it...just sweet enough. Wow, really something else.",5,7/21/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1253,"Proprietor/Pastry Chef: Joanne Chang.Saturday PM Lunch.Taste ***** For all you foodie lovers out there, don't be deceived.  This bakery not only entices with the ability to whet your sweet tooth, but their sandwiches and soups are just as appetizing.   I had their grilled roast chicken, with arugula, brie, roasted red peppers &amp; caramelized onions...  it was mouth-watering delicious.  Sandwiches made with simple goodness, no sugar coating any of the ingredients.  We opted for their sweet potato and cilantro soup ... rolling off the tip of my tongue it was so damn good.  For dessert, we picked the banana bread pudding, chocolate chip cookie and chocolate chocolate cupcake.  The cupcake was super moist and not overly sweet.  The cookie was scrumptious ... the banana bread pudding.. a bit too dry for me, I'll have to pass off on it for next time.  Ambiance *** Small, subtle cafe with a handful of tables inside.  A few tables outside... It was a Saturday afternoon, I felt claustrophobic..so many families and ... babies.  Babies, carriages frickin' everywhere.  Family friendly environment.  Meh.Service **** You order, pay and pick up your food all in one line.  Speedy ... we waited in line twice after lunch to pick up dessert.Dislikes - babies. not that Flour can help it.. the menu board is all chalked up.  It screams cutesy and family oriented.  No really, five stars. it can't get any better....Likes - The bakery and cafe concept.  It's very convenient for those that want to eat but have a sweet kick afterward... or just need to relax and unwind with a cup of joe...which is decent enough to pair.  Joanne Chang is a champ.. she won the throw down challenge against Bobby Flay ... she's a hero in my book.  Overall: Decadence knows I will be back for breakfast/lunch and dessert here!  We should have picked the sticky buns seriously... but they looked so dangerous and I was feeling less daring that day.  I'll have to savor the adventures another time.. it'll keep me drawn in for next... or just plain comatose!",5,8/1/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

1256,"Somehow, I heard about this bakery and their delicious sticky buns.  I also had to arrange food for my friend's babymama party.  I ordered a variety of sandwiches and desserts for the party/shower and threw in an order (for me) for 6 sticky buns, since they are always sold out when I go.  Of course, I over-ordered sandwiches, but none of us minded because we had lunch for the following day.  The sandwiches were generously filled and delicious. I ordered a small carrot cake and some sort of chocolatey cake.  Both were scrumptious and the carrot cake was particularly enjoyed by my pregster friend.  When we were arranging the sandwiches so they would look even fancier, someone picked up my box of sticky buns and started to open them.  I was like, ""Hands off!  Those are mine!"" and grabbed--yes, grabbed--them so they would not accidentally be eaten by the pregster and friends.  I didn't share!  I took them home and had delicious breakfast for a week.  Best sticky buns in New England.",5,8/14/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1257,"This place is well known for a reason... it is so damn good! I love their sticky buns. I cant imagine the caloric intake, I just don't want to know.... When I worked closer I used to go there for their BLT's. I could smell the bakery 2 blocks away- the aroma of bacon and baked goods was amazing. (But I wonder if the employees can ever wash that savory, sweet smell off completely? Anyway, I brought Boyfriend here this past weekend for breakfast before a visit to the ICA. Sadly they had already sold out of their sticky buns so he was not able to try them. He got a blueberry muffin top. It was big and filled with plump sweet blueberries. I got a pastry that was brioche that was rolled and filled with a citrus cream and some zest and topped with almonds. It was really good. The balance of flavors is amazing. To go for a snack we got a Bostok or a version of it. It was a tick slice of brioche that was soaked in an almond syrup, and tops with sliced almonds and powdered sugar. I'm not a big coffee drinker so I had a raspberry soda which was amazing. So sweet and refreshing and only 2.25! My Boyfriend is a heavy duty coffee drinker and he thought their coffee was really strong. He drank it but was quite shocked at first. I don't think you can go wrong here.

1261,"5.5 stars. Is there a better bakery in the US?  I moved to San Francisco a year ago and am yet to find a place that even comes close to Flour.  This place  has the most amazing baked goods (my favorites are the croissants, muffins, scones, and brioche).  Usually a baked good's flavors all mush together and have a certain uniformity to it.  At Flour you can distinguish each ingredient and how they perfectly come together.  It's like going from mono to stereo or black and white to color.  Coffee is outsanding, rich, smooth, dark roast.  And the environment?  Urban, sophisticated hip with a very modern interior in an old warehouse with exposed brick and wood beams.  Lastly, the owner.  Joanne Chang is not only visible at the bakery, but out and about in the community.  This isn't a group of investors who live in NYC or a retired asset manager who owns the place, lives in Wellesley, and rarely comes.  This is an owner/operator business of a true local. As I used to walk to work in downtown Boston, I would often see her riding her bike to work over the Fort Point Channel on her way to Flour.   This place is a true gem.  Unbeatable.",5,8/28/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

I turned around and this woman was standing there with her mouth open.  ""You girls got a WHOLE BOX?!  I just got a muffin, and I thought I was bad!""  Well let me just say that whole box was worth it.  Although I didn't really like the vegan berry muffin top.  I'd stick to the regular blueberry muffin top, unless you are vegan.I will be returning one day soon to get some homemade oreo cookies.  Very excited about that!",4,9/6/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

The first time we walked in the store we were hit by a huge array of pastry and my sweet tooth starts to ache the first time we visited the store.  We have to let several people behind us to go first because we cannot make decisions fast.   We had  the famous sticky bun, breakfast egg sandwich (with meat) and almond croissant on our first visit  We had twice baked brioche, blueberry muffin top and grilled roast chicken sandwich on our second visit.  We also ordered the smoked turkey and roast beef sandwiches to eat on the plane. (yes we are pigs). I really like the roast beef sandwich and almond croissant.   The almond croissant filled with almond paste and croissant is flaky.  The roast beef sandwich smells and tastes so good.  (I am salivating for the roast beef sandwich now. :(). I agree with some of other viewers, the sticky bun is good but not out of this world. (my sticky bun tasted better then theirs, SORRY).  Blueberry muffin top is filled with real blueberry but not memorable to me.

1266,"Sweet Baby Jesus do we love Flour.  From the Sticky Buns to the amazing Roast Beef Sandwich, we are hooked.  After trying a dozen or so upscale places in Boston, this is by far our favorite Brunch / Lunch spot in the city.  -The food is great, the staff is friendly in a laid back kind of way.-Great Sticky Buns (call ahead to reserve them).-Fantastic Roast Beef Sandwich.-Parking isn't great, but that seems to be the issue all over Boston so no deduction for that.",5,10/2/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1267,"For the sticky stick buns alone I give them 5 stars.If only there was one closer I would go there everyday and would gladly gain 100 pounds if it meant that I could have a sticky sticky bun everyday for the rest of my life.Although it can get pretty pricey, especially with all of those delectable sweets and dessert options, I think $7-$8 for a sandwich is completely fair.I had the grilled portobello sandwich with mozzarella, pesto, and tomatoes and it was divine.I also had to order a caramel latte to ensure I was giving it a fair chance in comparison to the other great cafe's I have been to and it passed the test. This is just the place that fits my tastes; It's upbeat, inviting, has good eats and the cashiers/baristas are awesomely nice. I really appreciate the atmosphere too- the bright colors really make a gloomy day that much more endurable.Although I am not a fan of meat, I tried the roast chicken, brie, arugula, peppers, and onions and I was really impressed that the chicken was so moist and the bitterness of the arugula was not too overwhelming. Both sandwiches were great concoctions and were beautifully put together. Confound my stomach for not being able to accommodate all the glorious edibles at Flour!I can't wait to go back and try everything (or all the un-meaty stuff I can try). Ps. We couldn't help but buy a slice of Boston cream pie and another sticky sticky bun for the road.",5,10/9/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1268,"You can just feel the fat depositing into YOUR buns after one of THEIR heavenly sticky buns. How many sticks of butter and bags of sugar are in one of these things? In all seriousness, the bakery items in general are divine, and on occasion, my husband will pick up a few for the weekend since he works in that area. Nice treat for us suburbanites.Many items can run out quickly, especially the sticky buns. The only complaint I have is that service can be a tad slow. I have never ventured over for lunch but I've heard the line can be out the door.Jillian Michaels be damned...bring on those sticky buns!",3,10/11/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1269,"3 words - breakfast sandwich bliss.  Details?  You place your order, wait a bit - these are handbuilt and the eggs are baked, I believe - and then you get your basket of eggy goodness.  It's a rectangle of egg that makes you think it's going to taste microwaved rubbery, but actually it is soft and creamy, just barely holding its shape as the flavors mix and meld with the thick, quality bacon, arugula, tomato, cheese and some kind of special sauce that tastes like a subtly mustardy aioli.  All this on a house made roll of some sort that looks like it'll be chewy but is actually soft inside.  The sandwich looks smallish but it'll fill you up and you will enjoy every last bite.  The coffee is good, too.  I ordered one of their famous sticky buns to take with me.  These are as delicious as everyone says and are even good the next day, warmed up in the microwave for 10-15 seconds.  All the pastries and cookies look great and I want to try more, plus I need to try their sandwiches.  Lines of rich people, some with small children in tow, are a little annoying, but to be expected given the upscale artsy, yuppie locale.",5,10/13/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1270,"When I worked in South Boston I was told one of the best places to get a quick bite to eat or have some delicious treats was Flour Bakery. So in the first few weeks of starting my new job, I took my co-workers up on there offer and what a treat to go there. Even though this particular cafe is small, it has that cozy and warm feeling to it and the people and staff are so friendly there as well. They have a wide variety of sandwich's, pastries, cold and hot drinks and breakfast items. So here are some of my can't miss items that you have to try when you are at Flour... 1) Smoked Turkey Sandwich: This is like having your thanksgiving meal all wrapped into this wonderful sandwich. It has this amazing cranberry chutney on it that I could eat the chutney alone by itself. 2) Sticky Buns: This gooey, gooey, treats are sooo good that you cant eat just one, especially when they are served pipping hot and the delicious frosting. YUMMY! 3) There fruit tart is heavenly, with creamy vanilla and delicious fresh fruit and they are just wonderful! 4) Raspberry drinks: These are very refreshing on a hot summer day I always get those when I get a sandwich at Flour. I wish Flour Bakery had a store out in the metro west area like in Framingham so I could continue to enjoy there tasty treats. I highly recommend if you are in the mood for an afternoon pick-me-up definitely try Flour Bakery.",5,10/15/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1271,"My new favourite Flour sandwich is the BLT. I think I can seriously eat this once a week and since I've tasted this a few months ago, I've abandoned my other sandwiches and only order this one. This is no ordinary BLT. The thick slabs of applewood smoked bacon are so flavorful--sweet and smoke-y and substantial. Tomatoes are fresh and the 'lettuce' isn't a piece of iceberg or romaine lettuce, but a handful of their mixed greens so with every bite you receive a burst of surprising flavors (including arugala!). They are generous with the mayo so if you don't love that, make sure you mention it. And I recommend the wheat bread because it is delicious.Another update is that I tried the chocolate raspberry trifle, finally! I never ordered it because in the display it looked too intimidating for one person to eat. But I split it among friends yesterday and it was amazing! There are layers of soft whipped cream (not too sweet), raspberry filling, and what we think is chocolate mousse mixed with small bits of cake (chocolate?)... YUM. EAT IT!",5,10/21/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1272,"I think that I can singlehandedly blame Flour for the 5 lbs that I have gained in the last three months. My favorites: 1. Curried tuna sandwich 2. Lamb sandwich with tomato chutney & goat cheese (OMFG) 3. Raspberry Lemon Curd Tart Everything tastes fantastic and you can really tell how quality the ingredients really are. One word of advice: If you go during lunch hour, either call ahead to place your order or be prepared for a potential wait. Clearly if you make great food, people will want to buy it. Sometimes they will want to buy it during their 12:00 lunch break. It is what it is, so suck it up and stop whining. Visit Flour and be prepared for your taste buds to be amazed!",5,10/22/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1273,"five stars as they really are the best in their category.  sandwiches are fantastic-- their soups are awesome-- the best I have had so far is a butternut squash soup.  They are not much pricier than Au Bon Pain- seriously- a sandwich at 7.50 v. one at 6.95 at ABP-- soups can be had for as little as $3.50 though a whole quart (for take home) is $9.00Their bakery items are expensive-- honestly-- $5 for a slice of carrot cake?  $2.75 for a pop tart?  However, all were worth it, and you know what you are getting into . . .  think of it as a consumption tax.It kinda has the ambience of a northwest hippie place-- an air they are obviously aiming for-- cute sayings on the chalkboard, etc.  The lines can be long, but move quickly--In the long run, I really have no complaints that don't go with the territory of a very good, popular place.",5,10/22/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1274,"I LOVE this place. It's delicious! I always come here when I'm in Boston and I ALWAYS get the roast beef sandwich, grilled. It's worth that 50 cents you pay TRUST ME. It makes the sandwich so crispy and delicious! I've also tried the lamb curry sandwich and it was only so so, and made me wish I had gotten the roast beef instead. I tried the boston cream pie and the hazelnut cake, the boston cream pie was delicious and the hazelnut was a bit too chocolately for my taste. It's really the sandwiches that are the star of the show!",5,10/25/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

1276,"So I come here every day, specifically for the homemade Rasberry Spritzer and usually leave here with one or two more things than I had originally planned. My only regret is that I can't eat everything on their menu all at once (though, in hindsight, that might not taste as good as I imagine it to..). Cons: Come here at noon and the line will be out the door. And I know some people say that and they're using it as a turn of phrase, but this line will literally be out the door and perhaps on the street if you're so unlucky. There's not a lot of indoor seating (especially for how popular it is) and a few seats outdoors.Umm, I guess I found a hair in my sandwich once? And the things here are a little pricey ($3 for a muffin)Pros: Said $3 muffin will make you think you had died and gone to heaven. I come for their house-made Rasberry Spritzer Soda, I stay for the sugar coated buns. The people are awesome, the service friendly and prompt and they support the local art scene by displaying local artists and paintings on the wall. Yay!",5,10/27/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1277,"I originally saw Flour on the Food Network when Giada visited for breakfast.  Usually I think to myself, ""she's so skinny, what can she possibly know about good pastries?""  But she was spot on about Flour.  The homemade Oreos are ridiculous.  I worked down by Flour for about a month over the summer, and it's a good thing it was temporary or none of my clothes would fit.  It would totally be worth it though.  Homemade Oreos?  Who even knew such a thing existed.  Plus, they have ice cold milk on the menu.  Pure genius.  Minus one star because I could never wait on the super-long line during my paltry lunch break. Comfort cookies at their finest.",4,10/27/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1278,"The limited exposure I have had with this place nonetheless leads me to a 5 star.  I do not normally have a sweet tooth.  I do when I come here.  Flour's has the best sticky buns I have ever had.  Don't care for sticky buns?  Try them here and you will.  All products with frosting or glaze are excellent.  The cookies and other ""normal"" baked goods range from decent to excellent.  This place is also a sandwich and entree cafe, but it is the sweet tooth items that they are known for.   Have not been to the Flour at South End.",5,11/5/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

1280,"I once had warm feelings for Flour, especially their chicken/avocado/jicama sandwich (maybe my favorite sandwich in Boston).  But then I made the mistake of trying to have a cake delivered for my friend's birthday.  I chose Flour because I knew firsthand that the baked goods were good, but mostly because the bakery is right around the corner from the birthday boy's office.  I was willing to plunk down the $40 for a cake, which to me is an awful lot of money for a cake to feed 6, and hoped they would work with me on the delivery fee since the cake's destination was so close by.  Wrong, wrong, wrong!  When I asked what the delivery fee would be for someone to walk the cake 30 feet down the sidewalk and up the elevator, the guy taking my order very reluctantly went to ask the manager, who was otherwise engaged.  He came back and informed me that it would be the full fee - yes, the full delivery fee of $30 - in order to have the cake delivered to the next building over.  When I pointed out that it was literally next door and would take less than 5 minutes, he feebly protested, ""Yeah, but someone would still have to leave and so it's the full delivery fee.""  This disgusted me on multiple levels;  first, why does it cost the as much to have someone drive a cake across town as it does to walk it next door?  Second, I always thought that the greatest thing about independent business is that they're run by real people rather than slaves to corporate policy.  They can be flexible.  The small businesses I have worked for have always been accommodating to customers.  But Flour?  They couldn't have cared less whether or not I ordered one of their cakes.  Soooo I didn't, and I won't.  FYI, KickAss Cupcakes, yelp what you will about them, drove a dozen cupcakes from Somerville to South Boston for a mere $15.",1,11/9/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

1282,Super Moist Banana Bread!!!  I've been craving a quality slice of Banana Bread and Flour had the perfect slice.  It was super moist and loaded with Walnuts.  I could definitely tell it had lots of butter but every single bite is worth it.

1283,"I came here since it was highly recommended on Yelp and boy was it worth it!  It was just a short walk from my hotel in the freezing cold.  I tried the sticky bun and man it went straight to my buns.  I am definitely not a fan of sticky buns, but yes, these were amazing.  Not overly sweet and I was able to enjoy every single bite.  If only I had asked them to warm mine up a little more.  This place has tons of other good breakfast foods but that was all I needed to fill me up.  Definitely want to go back here!",5,11/10/2009,Flour Bakery + Café
1284,"Brought my dad here on a rainy day when he had to catch a train out of South Station.  Absolutely worth the walk.When you enter on a Saturday morning, you'll probably have to pass by a half dozen strollers with adorable children waiting to go to the Children's Museum down the street.  Fortunately, it's really difficult to throw a tantrum with a cookie in your mouth, so they were all really well behaved.My dad had what looked to be a delicious smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwich thing, I had the breakfast pizza.  Both were much heartier and tastier than you'll find at most bakeries for breakfast.  Everything was piping hot and fresh, full of real vegetables and herbs.  As for pastries, we split a berry bread pudding (also to die for).The staff temporarily forgot my tea, and apologized profusely.  In the middle of what seemed to be the big morning rush, they managed to be calm and kind with their service.Just a warning - the space can get kind of tight, and we had to sit at some not-so-comfy stools.  If you have trouble navigating tight spaces or sitting without back support, you might want to take your food to go if it looks to be busy.",5,11/12/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

1286,"Mmm, so many good things are going on at this bakery café.  The pastries are tender, very fresh (often times still warm), and well made. The coffee is very good and they have an awesome variety of menu items from cakes, brioche, scones, cupcakes, cookies, croissant, sticky buns, donuts, bread pudding, steel cut oatmeal, homemade granola, crème brulee, muffins (pear ginger, pumpkin, bran), pizza, quiche, loaves of bread, rolls, brunch items on the weekend (French toast, home fries, bacon), soup, salad, sandwiches on housemade bread, homemade raspberry seltzer, homemade pickles, etc.  Even the signs are cute (the chalkboard menu with illustrations).  It's vegan friendly too.  They sell signature t-shirts, caps and mugs.Prices are reasonable.  Everything looks amazing.  I wanted a roasted lamb sandwich with goat cheese and tomato chutney (but it wasn't lunch time).* Lemon ginger scone ($2.25): Great texture.  Slightly crunchy exterior, very tender inside, with a very thin, sweet lemony glaze.  Mmm.  I didn't taste much ginger.  A refined scone.   * Brioche au chocolat ($2.75): Decadent, soft brioche style roll with a good dark chocolate inside.  Pastry cream makes it moist.  So tender and light.* Sugar bun brioche ($2.75): Like a morning bun but not as heavy and dense as a typical morning bun.  It bun was still warm!  Topped with sugar, the exterior is crusty and the interior is silky, tender, and buttery.  Mmm, divine.* Cheddar scallion scone ($2.75): The scone was tender and light, with plenty of scallions, but the exterior was very salty.Sunday is donut day and the donut of the day was chocolate dipped banana cream pie.  Cupcakes usually show up around 10 AM.I think Flour is going to be a part of my must go to list every time I'm in Boston.",5,11/16/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

I am a sucker for sugar and there isn't a single thing I don't love here. But what I love most are the scones. Scones of all kinds. And beyond that, the food. I have dreams about the roast beef sandwiches here. You must try them. The daily rotating soups are amazing as well. I could gush about this place forever.

While visiting a friend, I found the South Boston takeout scene to be lacking as my taste buds were so spoiled by the selection in the South End. So I told my friend I'd drive to takeout some Flour from the Waterfront bc he simply must try it. Well, of course he loved it. He devoured his grilled chicken sammie before I could even get in two bites of my chicken avo sammie! And he was surprised that he liked the raspberry seltzer I got him.This location is much bigger than the one on Washington St. but it still has the same charm.

1289,"I've had to wait to write this review at a time and in a place where I wouldn't be able to immediately run to Flour after I hit the Post button.  Like a couple thousand miles away.  The sandwiches are just insanely delicious.  I haven't had one yet that wasn't top notch, personal fave is the roast chicken.  The ingredients are inventive, fresh, and high quality.  But the bread (wheat, especially) is the star of the show.  It's probably been lightly coated with unicorn sparkle and fairy dust but I don't care, it's completely perfect in every way.The desserts and baked goods are epic.  Worthy of special occasions or for when an average brownie or sticky bun just will not do.  The variety and quality of the selection is fantastic.  Rounding out the menu there is quiche, pizza, soup, and take-out dinner specials.  They also label each item on the menu such as vegan or gluten free so you can adhere to your dietary/health needs while indulging. The service is generally friendly and I feel like the prices pretty well match with the quality.  One thing to note here, a trip here, especially during a meal rush, can really drag on.  If you come for lunch right at noon, expect to be there for 35-40 minutes, and that's the time it takes to stand in line to order and wait for the order, not eat it.  That is why I make 2 pm my Flour Hour.",5,11/27/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

If you're familiar with NYC, the area is similar to Red Hook in Brooklyn and the place is somewhat similar to Amy's Bread in Manhattan. They've got a number of sandwiches, soups, and paninis, and a decent selection of desserts and pastries (all of which baked on premises). When I went there were a ton of housewives and small children and strollers. The place is really nice and has some good homemade food. It wasn't amazing food and it was a tad on the pricey side, that's why I can't give them 5 stars, but it really was a Boston gem and it's a place that deserves future visits.",4,12/2/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

1293,"ahh i love it here! It is my favorite bakery in Boston, perhaps in Mass! They make their hot chocolate with ganache and then steam it with any kind of milk that you want! I get it with skim and it tastes soo indulgent! It takes a bit longer than most coffee shops but it is soo worth the wait! Their breakfast sandwiches are very different than anything I have tasted before. I ordered one, I'm not sure if it was a special, but it had a special spicy sauce with eggs, arugula, sun dried tomatoes and cheese. So good and I didnt feel like I ate my days worth of calories after either.I have never had a bad pastry from there, but my favorites are the chocolate chip cookie and macaroons. The service is just as good as the food here! I was having a terrible day and after walking in here and getting such chipper service, I felt much better! Usually I get into a bad mood after dealing with unpleasant servers. Flour is quite refreshing in every way! It is so cozy inside too! There is some metered parking and it is also walking distance from South Station. I'll repost when I try their sandwiches and soups.Overall: food: 5service: 5value: 4it's not incredibly cheap, but I would much rather pay a few cents more for something amazing than get something blah from sbucks or dunks",5,12/31/2009,Flour Bakery + Café

1297,"I typically don't spend much time in this neighborhood, but a friend was in town recently for a conference and we met up at the Convention Center and walked down here to have dessert and hot beverages.  My friend, trying a taste of classic Boston, got the Boston cream pie, along with a cup of hot chocolate.  I tried the raspberry and lemon curd cake, as well as a ""tisane"" (herbal tea), the one they call ""Crimson Berry.""  Our food and drinks were delicious.  I'm not typically a big fan of cake, but the lemon curd topper, the raspberry jam in between the two cake layers, and the fresh fruit topping the cake (a slice of kiwi and four pomegranate seeds) made it something really special, and made me glad I'd gambled on ordering it after seeing it look unusually enticing (for cake) in the case.  They don't post everything that's in their tea (though I imagine they'd likely tell you if you asked), so I'm not sure what all was in mine, but it was tasty anyhow, and an order of a ""small"" still garnered a good sized pot, filling the smallish mug twice.  My friend loved the Boston cream pie and enthusiastically raved three times about the deliciousness of the hot chocolate.  As we were leaving, I got a couple cookies to-go (Lime Cornmeal and Chocolate Hazelnut) and ate one a day for the next two days, both of which kept well and were delicious.  I especially loved the Lime Cornmeal one, an unusual and tasty combination.I've already recommended Flour to people who go down to the Waterfront more often than I do, and would happily come here again whenever I am in the neighborhood.",4,1/21/2010,Flour Bakery + Café

The toasted sandwiches are also great especially the Tomato, Basil , and Mozzarella. It is all about the bread here but then again it is a Bakery!

1300,"I visited the Flour Bakery and Cafe yesterday, and while I found the prices to be reasonable and the food to be well prepared, there was something amiss.     The atmosphere was just a little off.  I looked around to see what it was.  The decor was fine, there wasn't any strange music...what could it be.  It was the customers.     Obnoxious parents blocked the cramped dining area with over-sized strollers, while children ran around wild.  Two of the children injured themselves and cried about it loudly while I was eating lunch.     This is not the place to go on a Saturday around lunch time if you want a coffee and a quiet place to read.  During off hours, this should be quite a nice place to spend an hour reading or writing your novel.   While I usually don't hold a venue responsible for the behavior of its customers, I have made an exception in this case due to close Flour's proximity to the Boston Children's Museum, which is only a few blocks away.",4,1/31/2010,Flour Bakery + Café

1302,"Absolutely incredible! I've been to their other store in South End only once and instantly fell in love with it. This one is different only in layout - otherwise everything else from the food to the service is still the same. Recently tried their signature sandwich, grilled chicken, arugula, brie, peppers - heavenly. The sandwich isn't that big and they are fairly expensive for lunch, but oh so worth it! All their sandwiches sound very tasty, and the best part is any one of them can be turned into a salad for another 50 cents. Pretty awesome. I also had their macaroons, and they're to die for. It was very difficult to pass by all those desserts and sweet things and not be able to order them all. But considering how I have let winter take its course and succumed to the tube at home rather than the gym, I somehow refrained. Their coffee is great as well.As far as service goes, the people are very nice and genuinely seem happy to work there. It has a very neighborhood feel to it which I always appreciate. The menu is written up on a chalkboard (with really cute quotes) and somehow I associate that with great food. They also have daily specials which looked extremely appetizing. I really do adore this place and can't get enough of it. Next try will be the roasted lamb, tomato chutney sandwich and the raspberry bread pudding!",5,2/5/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1303,"My review in one line: we live 35 miles away, and make the trip several times each month -- it's that good!I first discovered Flour after it was featured in Bobby Flay's Throwdown a few years ago (the competition was for Sticky Buns).  Since then, it's become our family favorite place for breakfast and lunch both.  All the sandwiches I've tried (veggie, grilled chicken, BLT, tuna,) are great, and uniquely done.  The Breakfast sandwich with bacon, egg and arugula (it works!) is no exception.  The daily soup specials are always delicious-- my 6 year old son loved the cauliflower, potato, and parmesan soup! -- and the quiche is light, fluffy, and delicious.  Oh, and the cookies, cupcakes, scones, muffins, and homemade poptarts (!) are as good as you'll find anywhere.  Regarding the atmosphere, someplace this good and family-friendly, a block away from the Children's Museum, always has lots of families and kids on the weekends... but I've never found it to be a problem.  Seats are at a premium but it's always warm and friendly, and everyone behind the counter seems genuinely happy to see you.",5,2/7/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1304,"TAYSS-TEE!I like this place. Cute, hand drawn, ginormo chalkboard featuring their menu flank the left wall as you walk in. Clear glass wraps around their countertop creating a sort of ""display"" for their delicious baked ensemble.Ordered the lamb sandwich and shared with my friend who got the curry tuna.Both sandwiches are good, prices are fairly reasonable for the quality of the product you are receiving. Would definitely go back. Tasty sandwiches, tasty treats, you can't go wrong.",4,2/12/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1305,"Sandwiches are great and yummy. Some of the desserts are way overpriced.Why the three stars? I visit the Farnsworth street location and I think the flow is just wrong. You order your sandwich, then you pay, then they pass the order to the prep guys. So if there's a long line, you have to wait ten minutes to order your sandwich, then wait another 5 to pay, then your it goes in the cue.But then I've had numerous times where my order was just skipped, and I have to remind someone I'm waiting for a sandwich. Or someone in line behind me gets theirs made before me. Overall, good food, but counter customer service and expediency is severely lacking at times.",3,2/15/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1306,"My husband surprised me by taking me here for brunch on Valentine's Day (best surprise EVER).  This was our first trip to the Farnsworth location.Pros:-Huge menu on the side wall so you can look at it while you're in line-Lots of seating, including high chairs for little ones-Sticky buns.  GLORIOUS STICKY BUNS.  So light yet so decadent.  We got some to go for friends and they were good hours later.  -Breakfast sandwich!  The concierge at the Intercontinental recommended it and my husband said it was the tastiest he'd ever had.  Cons:-It's always busy, so you don't necessarily get a long time to look at the pastries before deciding -A little pricey, but worth every penny.So glad there are two locations!  Can't wait for the third!!",5,2/21/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1307,"I work in Fort Point, so Flour for me is one of very few available lunch places. And even so, I probably go there once a month or less.I'm not into their pastries or desserts. I had high expectations the first time, but everything's just so sweet, even the chocolate chip cookies.Their sandwiches are good, but so expensive. I'd go broke spending $8 for a sandwich. I like their tomato/mozzarella sandwich, but I also know it costs them about $1.50 to make.The wait to order can be long, and the wait to get the order even longer. That being said, it's a place that people know and ask about, and I will grant that I seem to be an exception in not loving Flour, both among Yelpers and my coworkers.",3,2/22/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1308,"Decent lunch selections... sandwiches, quiche, soups & salads.  I loved the quiche, but the chicken avocado sandwich was so-so.  They get an extra star from me just for having half sandwiches on their menu, and the $1 sweet pickles are well worth the price.  In general, their prices are probably on the upper scale for this type of eatery. The money you saved on the half sandwich will  most likely be spent on dessert anyway, which is well above-average.  They've got a wide selection, including Boston cream pie, fruit and chocolate tartes, cupcakes and cookies.  The biggest drawback are the interminable lines during lunch - be prepared to wait for your food or call ahead to order.",4,2/23/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1309,"I used to work across the street from Flour, and it is by far one of the best lunch places in the area. Their salads are original and delicious, sandwitches... yummm... grilled chicken avacado is great, and that sandwitch with jicama will stay in my memory forever. Don't come here if you are on a diet, because you won't be able to resist their deserts.",5,2/23/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1310,"I *tried* very hard to love this place based on the reviews and on the inspirational story on how this cafe was founded: ""lawyer-turned-pastry-chef-famous-bakery-foodnetwork"". Sadly, I was disappointed. Food and decor was just average; bathroom was bigger than most bakery cafes though... if that makes any difference.Anyhow, we ordered the grilled chicken panni. Just the size of my palm, very thin for a panni; so the chicken breast must have been sliced REAL thin, tasted cheesy. Flavor was ok but not spectacular.We also tried 4 different pastries: chocolate brownie (good, fudgy taste), banana bread slice (quite dense, very oily but flavorful), current scone (I've had better), and a vegan chocolate muffin (eh ... just average -- wholefood's vegan chocolate stuff tasted similar). Plus a cup of milk to go with the chocolate, the total bill came to $27 (including tips). Ouch! It burned a hole in my pocket.OK, here's my summary (I'm trying desperately to think of more pros.... oh well)Pros: - hmmm.... close to the T (South Station/Silver line Courthouse)- OK decor and seating- OK serviceCons:- Pricey!- Average tasting muffin/scone/pannis- Small portionsI feel the reputation is a little overhyped. It's not a bad bakery. I've had worst, but then I've also had better ones.",2,2/26/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1311,"I don't live or work anywhere convenient to the two existing Flour bakeries (the planned Central Square locale would be much more accessible), so when my boyfriend and I had to drop something off with a friend's office, I was pretty excited to see that Flour was RIGHT THERE!  We were in a rush to drive down to Virginia, and we were awkwardly parked on the road, but hey, I'm an opportunist.So there my boyfriend was, annoying drivers with his hazards on while I ran in and bought a chai, ""oreo"", granola bar w/ dried fruit, chicken+avocado+jicama sandwich, and a side of pickles.  A little bit of everything: drink, caffeinated sweet, fruity sweet, savory meal item, and side condiment.Everything was ""okay"" to ""great""--chai could've been milkier, ""oreo"" was a bit too sugary, granola bar was really good.  The pickles were probably made to go with the sandwiches (read: a little too strong to eat alone), but they don't really go with the sandwich we got.But the sandwich!  THAT was fantastic.  I'm going to say that God gave me a great pair of eyes because they led me straight to the chx+avo+jic sandwich description, and didn't let me see anything else.  What a choice!  Not only was the combination perfect, but the boy and I were happy to get our first taste of jicama in a while.",4,3/2/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1312,"I started working in South Boston a few months ago, and I have been going to Flour for lunch every single day. I love it. Every day, I check their website for their daily specials, then head on down to get some delicious stuffed bread, soup, sandwich or quiche. Of course, I can't leave without also getting a ginger molasses cookie; those things are addictive!I love the atmosphere of the place too. It is energetic and doesn't have that ""yuppie lunch"" feel like Metro around the corner. Also, for some reason, there seems to always be a lot of attractive women there, staff and customers included.",5,3/3/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1313,"My spouse had remembered this place from Food Network, and as it was in the area we were staying, we decided to give it a shot with our child.  We wound up visiting 2-3 times, as the food was so good, it was close, it was reasonable, service was good, and it had a lot of variety.  All bakery items were excellent, the sandwiches were great quality and interesting, and, strangely, I think they had the best potato salad I have ever had.   Great sticky buns as well (this was their marquee item on the food network program.)This is a great casual and affordable option in the downtown/waterfront area.",4,3/7/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1314,"Flour can be a bit pricey for a sandwich or bakery item, but they do a good job.  Especially considering your other options in the area (DD, ABP, slice of pizza, lunch rush at Metro), Flour can be a breath of fresh air.  I haven't had a baked good here that I didn't enjoy.  (Ginger molasses cookie is a personal fave.)  Their sandwiches are well made with quality ingredients.  For example, the roast chicken with avocado and jicama is delicious.  And where else in the area would you find a roast lamb sandwich with tomato chutney and goat cheese?  Or a lemon ginger scone?",4,3/10/2010,Flour Bakery + Café

1316,"This is my second time at Flour.  It's an amazing bakery.  It's worth every penny you spend here.  I ordered a slice of their french toast and a slice of quiche.  Both items are the best that I ever had!  French toast had very good texture.  It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside but not soggy.  Served with real maple syrup.  The quiche had mushrooms and potatoes in it.  Very smooth and light.  It also comes with a little mixed greens on the side, had I known that I probably would not have ordered the french toast.  So good that I ate all of it!  I did see a sign at this location.  It's closed on March 15 for remodeling.  Not sure when it will re-open, so call before you stop on in.",5,3/13/2010,Flour Bakery + Café

1320,"I've worked pretty close to Flour for three years now. I really like it there. I have two reasons for giving it 4 stars instead of 5:1. They generally have VERY slow service. Now, this is partially because they are careful about the making of your drinks/sandwiches/etc, but also partially from inefficiency. It's not a big deal if there are very few people in line or waiting for their food, but it's hell if you're there at the lunch rush. I've waited 45 minutes before for a sandwich, which is absurd, no matter how good it is. 2. The price. They are a little on the pricy side for a bakery/sandwich shop. Don't get me wrong, they do make incredibly good food, but if you get, say, a sandwich/stuffed bread, a hot drink and a pastery, it can easily be $15 just for lunch.Words of advice: DO NOT go there between about Noon to 1:15pm on a weekday. You get all the business-people of the nearby area and all of the children's museum lunchers. If you go even a little before this time, or a little after, you'll be fine, but don't go then!Try to go in the morning - they have a really large selection of pasteries and other goodies, but between the morning coffee people and the lunch people, a lot of the good stuff can be sold out by the afternoon.Things to try:The oatmeal (served until 11am) - good oats, candied nuts, carmelized apple chunks and raisins, which you can augment with honey, brown sugar, or other good things. They mix it up with the addons fresh for you, so you can easily ask them to leave a part out of you don't like it.The oreos - crispy chocolate cookies with a fresh tasy cream inside. The banana bread - a little tiny bit on the oily side, and has nuts, but incredibly flavorful and tasty. The hot chocolate - they use a nice semi-sweet concoction, so you get the chocolate taste and sweetness without it being overly sugary.The stuffed bread - a calzone style heated pocket. They change what type it is everyday, but it usually has a mix of meat, potatoes/rice, vegtables and a sauce.The lemon-raspberry cake - it comes in a small, round single-serving size, or also as a larger cake. Awesome pound cake with raspberry filling and a fresh lemon cream on top. Very good stuff.",4,4/1/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1321,"The set up of Flour doesn't really lend it self to long wait times which can be a problem. It can get very busy around the pick up counter and the condiment station making the, often long, wait time pretty intense. That being said. It's a very cute lunch/pastry shop and the staff remain surprisingly cool such a busy environment.My sandwich was very good (turkey cranberry) and my friend's was even better (something with yummy pesto on it) but I felt like they were over priced at $7.50 and nothing to go with it. PLUS 50 cents extra to toast the bread?? C'mon...The pastry's all looked quite delicious as well but we took a pass on those as they were also on the high side of our pastry price range.",3,4/3/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1322,"Visited this place on a friday night, while it was raining outside, and it was still full.  Now, this place doesn't really have that much seating so don't count on having a place to sit and eat if you visit this place.  However, I would definitely go here to pick up food and perhaps go to a park.  Great Picnic food.  They have specials, so definitely try everything out, dont really think you could go wrong with anything.  Ooo, they also have a good selection of tea, so if you're into that sort of thing, definitely come try this place out.",4,4/5/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1323,"Been here several years ago and was looking forward to returning.But it was a bit of a let down.  We went a little crazy and ordered 5 different things:1) pizza with spicy roasted peppers and pesto - meh, this pizza has nothing on good New Haven, New York or even SF pizza.  It was fine and good.2) oatmeal with roasted pecans/fruit - I have had far better steel cut oatmeal at a variety of places include City Bakery in NY and even at Whole Foods.  It was a bit too creamy and mushy for my taste.  The roasted fruit was apples and it was okay but didn't really go with the creamy taste in the oatmeal (tasted as if it were made with milk)3) lime cornmeal cookie - The woman behind the counter said that this was her second favorite thing..  really?  it was like a really hard cornbread top with some lime flavoring and glaze.  Big disappointment.4) chocolate cupcake - this was good.  This was a great chocolate cupcake - you could taste the good quality chocolate used in the cake and the buttercream frosting was delicious.  This classic cake gives Sprinkles and Magnolia's a run for their fancy-pants money.5) quiche with ricotta, spinach - This was very meh.  Nothing special, neither the ricotta filling nor the crust was anything better than I have had at many cafes/restaurants.... I think the challenge with Flour is that it has had such high ratings/review (including Zagats) that it can't possibly meet these expectations.  living in both NY and SF- I would have to say that both City Bakery (NY) and Tartine (SF) are far better than Flour (not even in the same league).",3,4/6/2010,Flour Bakery + Café
1324,"Ahh, Monica's - the only place I've been able to find that sells fresh pasta. Frankly, just because I live in the North End doesn't mean I'm eating out every night. Sometimes I like to cook at home, and if it involves pasta, I stop at Monica's. The service here is decent, and if Monica is in the store, you'll know it - she'll inquire about your meal and insist on giving you a plastic bag, even if you're like me, insisting I don't need one.",4,6/23/2005,Monica's Mercato
1325,"This place is kind of expensive and doesn't have the selection of random things that complete your meal. For example, I went here for pesto and pasta but had to go down the street to Going Bananas for the fresh herbs and cheese I wanted. A little weird since this place has tons of cheeses. So I recommend going here for the pasta and then going the cheaper route with Going Bananas for the other items that complete your meal. Also, you can't charge anything under $10 which is a pain for those of us who rely heavily on the debit card.",3,3/14/2006,Monica's Mercato

You can grab some picnic food and go sit out on the greenway or in the park on atlantic, or you can pick up a delicious meal after a long day of work. The sandwiches are soo tasty (best one-the italian...of course). They slice their meat paper-thin to order; but what makes their sandwiches so good is that Monica's Trattoria (across the street...highly recommend) bakes their bread fresh every day, and sometimes twice a day. You choose the bread that you want, and Corey (one of the adorable guys that work there) will make sure he makes the sangy exactly how you want it. Like the delicious bread, all of the deli meals (grilled chicken, beef, lasagna) are made at the Trattoria as well. That's not all...they have a wide selection of fresh pasta that you can get in any amount. Most of the time I'll just walk in and tell them to give me enough for dinner. This pasta doesn't even compare to dry pasta and it goes perfectly with their homemade bolognese. It's not too expensive considering what you're getting...a delcious homemade meal on the go. I think a meal of fresh pasta was around $5 or so. That aside, this is the type of business you want to support.

They talk to you about what you are looking for and recommend the appropriate items and quantity (Why yes I will take the special mozzarella cheese that melts). When I went to visit my boyfriends Italian Grandparents in Florida they picked out some items for me to bring as gifts. His Grandparents loved them, thus insuring a lovely vacation.

Both the Salumeria and the Ristorante are staples for me, and every time I approach either of their doors I get a little bout of butterflies in the tummy because I know I'm going to get something great. The Salumeria is, I beg you to believe me, the only place you should go for a sandwich in the North End. Get a tomato and mozz on focaccia and you will probably black out for a second while your body tries to process the delicious. My husband is an Italian Sub aficionado and absolutely swoons over theirs. The reason for this symphony of sandwich superlatives is that they make their sandwiches from the insanely fabulous meats and cheeses they have in the case (which you can buy and take home, if you can get them home without devouring them on the way). Anything you buy from this place is going to be top quality. To be honest, the food here is so good that the staff could be a pack of rabid ogres and I'd still go there. But the guys behind the counter are utter darlings. They are so fun and cute and one time one of them remembered my sandwich order without my having to tell him and I got all giggly like a tween at a Justin Bieber concert. If you do go here for a sandwich, remember that art takes time. This is not a Subway. So it might take a few minutes to get your sandwich but it will be well, well worth it.

1349,Hands down my fav Italian deli in the North End .  Great food ... friendly and knowledable help and a selection of cheese and meat that will please even the most picky.   Well worth the stop.,4,1/7/2011,Monica's Mercato
1350,"Tasty sandwiches (and boys)! Monicas has amazing sandwiches made with the freshest ingredients and the adorable, flirty boys that make them are the icing on the prosciutto and fresh mozzarella. Once you get past being called ""baby"" or ""sweetie"" you'll notice great fresh pastas and a wide assortment of meats and cheeses. They also sell prepared foods and beer and wine which make Monicas a one stop shop for your lunch or dinner needs! Careful, its really tight inside if others get there before you. It can probably only hold about 5 people max but even if you have to wait to go in - its worth it!",5,1/10/2011,Monica's Mercato
1351,"This place is on Salem St, tucked away from the hordes of useless tourists on Hanover.  The market is super small and there's meats and wines and cheeses everywhere.  Stopped in for old time's sake and the guy by the door, with the Red Sox cap glued to the head at birth, welcomed me immediately.  I was awed that he would remember me 6 years later, but then I realized he called everyone ""Pal"", even the ladies that stopped by.  I had some cheese wrapped in prosciutto and roasted red peppers.  Tasty.",4,2/10/2011,Monica's Mercato
1352,"Being a first generation Italian-American, I grew up with the various dried meats, cheeses, antipasti, and sweets that come with the territory of said nationality. Part of being raised in an old school family that's right off the boat. Couldn't open the fridge without finding sticks of soppressata, a hunk of extra sharp provolone, or a jar of olives. Boy, does Monica's have it all. More meats and cheeses than you can shake a stick at, including some very hard to find items, like burrata and guanciale. Hand made pasta, fresh daily. Pick up a six pack of Yoga, or a bag of Baci. Maybe a package of Mix Max cakes, or a jar of imported nutella. Can't go wrong. Prepared food ready to grab and go? Got that too. Wine? You're covered.The guys behind the counter are in a league all their own. Good guys who are extremely knowledgeable about their stock, and are quick to suggest something should you not quite know what you're looking for. And they can all make a mean sub. Trust me on that one. Do yourself a favor. Head over to the corner of Salem and Prince in the north end, and check Monica's out. You won't regret it.",5,3/13/2011,Monica's Mercato
1353,"I agree w every positive review, but I didnt see enough talk about the salads.  Monica's makes the BEST SALAD TO-GO IN BOSTON.  Bar none.  Fresh greens, roasted vegetables, steak, ricotta salata, their own dressing.  They chop everything up and the result is perfect every time.",5,3/20/2011,Monica's Mercato

1355,"I went here yesterday for the first time after walking by for almost two years and I was blown away.  First off there are tons of meat and cheeses here, salads and wine/beer.  Lots of stuff crammed into this little place.  They also had some imported sodas from Italy as well as Mexican Coke.  A couple of kids from out of town came in and asked what they had.  The guy behind the counter proceeded to run down the list of sandwiches and one of the kids decided to order a prosciutto sandwich with Barbecue sauce.  He was corrected and directed towards the Italian sub.  Anyway awesome place, great food.  Little pricey though, however you get what you pay for.",4,4/16/2011,Monica's Mercato
1356,"Oh Monica's, I would have a torrid affair with you. I would make you leave your husband,  then marry you only to have you leave me for that guy who wears skinny ties and rides a Vespa. But I would love every minute of it.Not only do you have an esoteric salumi and formaggio selection, with fresh pastas, good (and cheap) wine, and (AND!) you also have amazing arancini, emapanadas(I know, right?) with chicken cutlet sandos with balsamic reduction and burrata to die for, but you also have experienced staff that can help you navigate from a Pecorino Toscana di Pienza to a Podda to the finer points of why culatello is the finest of all cured meats, like a Maserati through the hills of Tuscany. Monica's, mi amor, stay salty.",5,5/5/2011,Monica's Mercato

Haha no joke. It smells like an Italian heaven.",5,5/9/2011,Monica's Mercato

1359,"I had passed by this place so many times and never walked in, but I'm so glad I finally did.  The guys behind the counter are super friendly, the Genoa salami was delicious (I have feelings about Genoa salami), and the bread was fantastic.  I spied some fig jam on the counter... I'll definitely be back.",4,6/19/2011,Monica's Mercato

It might look a little intimidating (small, no easily discernible menu), but the guys who work there are awesome; both helpful and ridiculously nice.1. Best Italian sub. Not only in Boston, possibly ever. Ridiculously good. The meat's great, then you get a taste of balsamic.2. Chicken parm is amazing. Something about the bread they use; everything comes together.3. Amazing caprese sandwich. They do mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic, then layer prosciutto on it that's so thin it melts in your mouth.I'm hungry now.",5,12/17/2011,Monica's Mercato

1369,"Monica's lives up to all the hype.I live in the neighborhood and have been here a few times, not as often as I would like however b/c it can get a bit crowded.First time, I couldn't make out a menu. There are imported Italian goods in every nook and cranny... so it might take you a second, but fresh items for the day are displayed on the counter top, left hand side. Take a look there, in the cooler, or if you don't see a sandwich option, ASK. There is also a freezer in the back with assorted frozen raviolis. I get those and their vodka sauce for a simple and delicious meal.My bf loved their chicken parm sub. I had their salad, which since they were out of chicken was topped with a marinated steak instead. OMG, I think it was all the better for it! The bf was jealous of that tasty steak!Hit it up most recently last weekend to get some supplies for a dinner party I was hosting, needed some good Italian prosciutto and mozzarella. It was a Saturday around maybe 3:30, no one was in there, great to get in and out! Although not without a little flirting from the counter staff first. ;) Both were delicious and enjoyed by my friends.",5,2/22/2012,Monica's Mercato
1370,"here's how to do monica's. pro style:1) walk in and order a prosciutto caprese (pr: cap-reez-ee) sub 2) don't worry about it when they address you as ""babes"" even if you're a guy3) stroll down to the park and enjoy the best sub in the world while soaking up the sun and watching the sailboats glide across the sparkling ocean4) thank the good lord that you live in boston spring needs to hurry the eff up",5,3/6/2012,Monica's Mercato
1371,These guys are great! Their raw ingredients are high quality and fresh.  I also came here and grabbed an italian sub for lunch and it was pretty good as well.  Most places mess up on simple items such as this because of bad ingredients.  Because Monica's use fresh ingredients the sandwiches turn out delicious.,5,3/16/2012,Monica's Mercato
1372,"Absolutely love Monica's.  It certainly doesn't hurt that I live right near by, but the guys working there are really the sweetest, all the time.  And you might think its just to girls, but no way, they are equally nice and friendly to my husband.  Their sandwiches are absolutely delicious, maybe a tad expensive, but living in this neighborhood that should be a shock to absolutely no one...  Anytime I'm having a party or guests over I run to Monica's and grab a variety of cheeses and antipasto - they are super helpful too if you have no idea what you want.  Oh, and the bolognese sauce they sell there can't be beat.",5,3/29/2012,Monica's Mercato
1373,"This place is GREAT.  Awesome food and the guys behind the counter are the best (they make you feel like a beauty queen even if you look at hot mess).  Other reasons I love this place:~ Prepared foods make me wish I had the preparer living at home with me~ Food is always fresh~ You can grab a bottle of wine or a case of beer and there is a great selection ~ You can place large orders for family gatherings or a party~ There's a small TV inside above the door (that usually has one of the games playing) ~ Cutie pies behind the counter (yes, I know I already mentioned that)~ Bruins guys grab food there... which should tell you 2 things... 1.  The food is obviously good and 2.  You could be grabbing a sub and happen to bump into a star :)",5,5/1/2012,Monica's Mercato
1374,Open reasonably late. Great italian sub on house made bread. Many of the cured meats are produced in house as well.,5,5/16/2012,Monica's Mercato
1375,"Monica's is great - but judging by the rest of the reviews you already knew that. What you DIDN'T know about (as no one has mentioned it yet) is the Porchetta Sandwich.You won't find it on the menu, but here's the breakdown. They roast a Porchetta (pork tenderloin wrapped in a pork belly), which is used to make a sandwich that's fit for a king. Ask for it Cuban style, and along with a generous portion of the aforementioned good stuff, you'll get pickles, mayo, mustard, and your pick of cheese.The large is plenty for two people. So, if you live life by the Golden Rule of ""do unto others as you would like done to you"", grab a friend / enemy / stranger and split this sandwich with them along with whatever prepared foods fit your fancy. Good karma will ensue.",5,7/9/2012,Monica's Mercato
1376,"As someone who grew up adoring cooked Chinese greens, I like salads okay. Sure, I'll agree to share one as an appetizer to counter whatever ridiculous meat concoction I'm ordering, but I almost never get one as a main course. But after about five days of intense travel eating, I decided to get a salad with steak from Monica's to consume on my flight. This is by far one of the best salads I've ever had, and now I'm sad that we don't have Italian delis like this in the Bay Area (I think? perhaps I'm wrong). Monica's has no menu, so you have to ask the guys behind the counter to tell you their various sandwiches and salads. I had no idea what would be in my salad, but as it was prepped, I got excited. All kinds of things from their prepared food case got thrown in there: roasted veggies (broccoli, peppers, onions, eggplant, carrots), broccoli raab, salad greens, ricotta salata, and of course the steak.  It's super delicious...and super filling. All the flavors were great together: bitter raw greens, faintly sweet roasted veg, salty cheese, balsamic-y steak, and garlic-y/olive oil-y everything. YUM. They really pack it into the container, so it's quite a hefty $8.99 salad.",5,8/7/2012,Monica's Mercato
1377,"They have lots of Italian specialty products, some items imported and rare, some made in Texas or somewhere and made to look ""authentic"". If you need something to make or finish that special Italian meal for your lady, it's good. Wine store down the corner too.",4,10/2/2012,Monica's Mercato
1378,"I take credit for being a one-time most frequent customer.  Living in the Northend means one thing for certain... Everything is loaded with carbs. That is, except Monica's.  You can go in here and for $10 get a plate full awesome classically Italian prepared veggies and a protein (maybe haddock, chicken fingers, steaktips, stuffed shrimp)  It's all bomb.  Plus, the guys and one girl who work their are patient, helpful and accommodating. Only reason I no longer get dinner here 5 times a week.. I moved.",5,10/9/2012,Monica's Mercato
1379,"All visits to the North End should require a visit to Monica's, even though the space is so tiny that squeezing more people in here could be a stress inducer. Come in during an off peak time, however, and you may be the only one in here, surrounded by the glory that can only be found in a small, family run food shop. You'll also get the full treatment from the nice folks behind the counter who are beyond helpful when you have no clue what you really want, yet you know you want something. This photogenic shop specializes in the glories of Italy, from assorted olive oils and cheeses to a broad array of wine selections. It is a charmingly small space, covered from floor to ceiling with colorful ingredients and food. What do you want? Fresh bread, home made pasta, the authentic Italian Nutella, not the Americanized version, take out food, deli meats and more can all be uncovered here. It is also a rich reminder of the past, when there were no Stop N Shops, Whole Foods and Market Baskets. In that way, it is a little cultural gem, not just for the food lover, but for the historian and anyone with an interest in small businesses. If you are wary of spending 6 or 7 dollars a pound for home made pasta. stuck to whatever is on sale at Shaw's in a thin blue box, indulge, even just once, in the genuine article here at Monica's. You barely need anything to go with it, but a small amount of olive oil, garlic, grated cheese or fresh pasta sauce will do the trick. (Just do not drown this pasta in sauce as it deserves to be the star of the show.) Order up a custom made sandwich for a picnic lunch and pick up a delicious treat for your evening meal. Get the best Italian cheeses, meats and balsamic vinegars to impress your guests. Surprisingly affordable and delightfully appealing for cooks, food lovers, tourists and residents alike, this is one totally unique place that should not be overlooked on any North End visit.",5,10/19/2012,Monica's Mercato
1380,"It is places like Monica's that make me so thankful to live in a wonderful neighborhood like the North End of Boston. While I'm sure the wines, Italian groceries, homemade pasta and sauces are great, I come here solely for the sandwiches. On weekends and peak hours, Monica's can get busy, and because the staff takes great care on making the sandwiches, it can at times take some time to get your sandwich. So I recommend either coming in during off hours or calling in your order. I will say that for many years, there was very little turnover and the staff were unbelievably good at mixing and matching different ingredients to make the best sandwiches. More recently, I have seen a lot of new faces and I'm less confident in asking them to be creative so I stick with the traditional options such as the Italian, or steak tip sandwich or prosciutto caprese or sausage sandwich. I hate to make it more widely known as it is often sold out, but as another reviewer mentioned, my favorite sandwich is the cuban. Their pork is out of this world. All that said, there are so many different ingredients that can be used to make a sandwich, when I first found out about this place, I came here almost every day so that I could try all that they had to offer. Their small sandwich ($8) is a good size and for the quality of their ingredients, it's worth every penny.",5,11/21/2012,Monica's Mercato
1381,"Monica's---ahhh, what can I say?? I ADORE Monica's more than any other place in the North End (and there's a lot to love...!). I ate lunch here 3 times a week for six months when I worked around the corner. It is an adorable Italian grocery store that is also a deli/sandwich shop. Note: there is nowhere to sit and eat, but if the weather is nice there's a park on Prince Street around the corner (past Bova's Bakery--also great and the best bakery in the North End--don't deal with Hanover St and tourists if you want a real North End experience!). There really isn't a menu, per se, but the guys at Monica's can make you anything. My go-to was the grilled chicken salad with either mixed veggies or brussels sprouts and/or asparagus, and ricotta salata (delicious). And get the bread--also amazing and fresh. On other ""splurge days"" I would get the caprese sandwich with prosciutto--delicious and fresh. Everyone is so nice at Monica's (admittedly, the guys LOVE ladies and are totally charming flirts!-and we love it!) but they are the BEST and very helpful with all customers--tourists and regulars! They provide wonderful service and authentic, fresh food in the North End.",5,11/26/2012,Monica's Mercato

1385,I have gone here a few times and not once has my order been right. Ive had to go back every time to get what I actually ordered. One time my hot sub was so cold that I was scared to eat it because I wasn't sure if the meat in it was cooked. The subs were very over priced too. $11 for a sub is extremely high for the North End. I could go to DePasquales and get one that is much better for $8.,2,5/29/2013,Monica's Mercato
1386,"A beautifully inviting place and a really charming woman working the register (and the crowds within and outside the store with her banter), but unfortunately the Regular caprese I ordered was $8 of a waste. Crusty bread wasn't bad but after removing the prosciutto that they specifically asked if I wanted (and I declined), I was left with maybe $3 of product, all of which was unremarkable. Botched experience for sure in this narrow space - shame...",2,6/6/2013,Monica's Mercato

1388,"They claim they have the best Italian sub in Boston. They are correct. It is loaded with delicious meats and cheese, freshly sliced to order. Fresh bread, veggies, balsamic vinegar and hots round out this glorious sandwich.  You may have to wait 5 minutes for your sub to be made but it is WELL worth it!  Oh and aside from that, they also offer fresh pasta, an amazing selection of cheese, even wine and beer.

I don't care how busy or popular you are - get it together!  My friend and I will not be back here.  No loyal, paying customer should be treated this way.  Not a smart way to let out your personal anger if you want to keep customers.",1,10/26/2013,Monica's Mercato

In the end, I walked out of there with three different meats and a big grin from ear to ear. Prosciutto, spicy sopressata, Mortadella as well as some awesome provolone and a perfectly ripe vine tomato.

1407,"Damgerously delicious Italian sub with the works. Ordered a small and it was pilled high with meat, not for the shy of heart. Balsamic glaze gave a nice kick too Market is cute as well with a lot of wine, cookies and imported goods",4,5/25/2014,Monica's Mercato
1408,the food is soo soo good! It is my first time here! i got the italian subs. I gave it a four bc there is no menu so you dont really know what to get! The sub is quite amazing. So fresh & juicy! Most of the materials are homemade::) It has a nice homey environment!,4,7/3/2014,Monica's Mercato
1409,"seriously. worth. 5 stars.  I am not a fan of Italian deli meats, i don't LOVE them. I'll eat them but eh... I don't like tomatoes, and I don't really like sandwiches...BUT the Italian sub here... OMFG... heaven.  It's like the most delicious fresh bruschetta with meat and cheese in sandwich form.  A small is not so small, its like a foot long, i don't know what sort of a monstrosity they serve and call a large.  You can get sandwiches with hots, which i'll try next time.  Monica's is also an awesome little grocery/deli.",5,8/2/2014,Monica's Mercato
1410,You can easily walk by this place looking for it but once you're there it's Italian sub heaven. The Italian is the only thing you must have.,5,8/3/2014,Monica's Mercato
1411,"Steak tip sandwich was so good. Generous amount of steak with lettuce tomato onions on fresh and soft bread. ""small"" size was $8, what a steal.",5,8/25/2014,Monica's Mercato
1412,"I will start out by saying my 5 stars is for the Italian sub only. I was told they have awesome Italians, and their sign says best in Boston...AGREED!! I can't speak on anything else there because whenever I'm in the north end I just hear it calling my name and I have to get it. Bread is fresh, meat is sliced to order, fresh tomato, pickles made there, just perfect.",5,9/5/2014,Monica's Mercato
1413,"Get the spicy sapprosetta (not sure if I spelled it correctly), but it's basically spicy salami. DELICIOUS. My friend and I made a stop inside here and couldn't resist getting a bag of salami to snack on as we roamed around this area of Boston. They also carry fresh pasta which look amazing... If I lived in Boston, I'd be here everyday!",5,9/8/2014,Monica's Mercato
1414,"Far and away, they sell the best tomato sauce I've ever had. It tastes so fresh and when you dunk their loaves of bread in it, you'll learn what heaven is. I could rave about every last thing I've ever had from here. Very glad to live around the corner from such a gem.",5,9/10/2014,Monica's Mercato
1415,"unbelievable italian sub. i moved down the street from this fabulous place a few months ago and finally got the chance to grab lunch there. SO glad i did!! i ordered the small and it was plenty big for a very very filling lunch. everything tastes so fresh and perfect! highly, highly recommend this!",5,9/14/2014,Monica's Mercato

1417,This was the most amazing Italian sub. I mean what else can I say? The bread was perfect and quality meats and cheese with a great dressing.. It's a must for sandwich lovers when visiting Boston.,5,9/27/2014,Monica's Mercato
1418,Excellent Italian sub. One of the best I've tried. Would recommend grabbing to go and taking the short walk over to the Paul Revere mall to eat.Room for Improvement: Add a menu w/ prices!,4,10/13/2014,Monica's Mercato
1419,"As advertised: Best Italian Sub around. Bread is fresh and crunchy, meats are tasty, and toppings are on point as well. They put this balsamic concoction on it that goes perfectly with the rest of the sandwich. Have had the Caprese too. Very good too.",5,10/16/2014,Monica's Mercato
1420,"Check this place out! Go hungry. You will be glad you did... The Salumeria has been beautifully maintained and updated so as not to lose the reflection of the family, heart and soul of the North End. As for food; The Italian Sub is fantastic. The meat is thinly sliced and the balsamic mayo complements the freshness of the bread and veggies.  My husband and I were visiting from Florida and ""Flash"" from ""politically incorrect tours"" took us to Monicas and we were fortunate enough to meet Frankie and Pat. On our last day in Boston, we returned and bought $40.00 worth of fresh pastas, sauce and raviolis. We flew home to Florida and boiled water the minute we walked in the door. The pasta and marinara was incredible. I wish we would have bought more. These good ole Boston boys have done it so very right!!! Their mother would be so incredibly proud!!! We cannot wait to return to stock up on fresh pasta, sauces and bread and visit the pizzeria that will be opening downstairs!!!",5,11/9/2014,Monica's Mercato
1421,"Love this place. I've watched it grow and expand over the past 15 years, from when Monica worked the counter, one of the most gracious and hospitable ladies I've ever met. Pat and Frank and staff continue that warm hospitality with the best offerings, from cheeses, meats, to specialty imports, and of course their house made choices, like steak tips, roasted chicken, rapini, focaccia, etc...it's here you will get the best Italian sub in North End, a nice lunch to go, and all your specialty needs, imported artisanal and house made pastas, I could go on. Why go elsewhere in the neighborhood? Basically, you shouldn't, this is the best mercato",5,11/11/2014,Monica's Mercato
1422,"You know you are in the right place when you got salami hanging from the ceiling and no menu. The guys working behind the deli counter are pretty nice and can pretty much make anything to order. I asked for a chicken cutlet Napolitano (chicken, prosciutto, cheese, etc.) and it was DELICIOUS! They put this balsamic vinegar glaze and olive oil concoction on it and it was perfect. Also, they make the best Italian sub I've probably ever had. Monica's also has a wide selection of imported Italian foods. Another perk is that it's not too busy like all the other Italian joints on Hanover street. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. You won't be disappointed.",5,11/11/2014,Monica's Mercato
1423,"I love this place. The owners are always nice, the place is always clean and the food is great. Their subs are really amazing and a must try. They just opened a pizza place that is also amazing right next door. Definitely recommend",5,11/19/2014,Monica's Mercato
1424,"Amazing pizza but the lady behind the counter is the worst.I phone in an order, she asks me what I'd like, a large prosciutto pizza, she asks me to hold, I'm like alright that's cool you're busy. I hear her asking what someone would like to order, I think she's talking to someone else but NOPE she's talking to me. I state again, a large prosciutto pizza for pickup. She asks me my name and phone number which had to be repeated about 10 times, then my address which I then said I'm going to pick up but she wanted it anyway. I'm right around the corner so whatever. She then asks me what I'd like to order. At this point I'm like, is this a joke? Is this lady high? I need A LARGE PROSCIUTTO PIZZA, stressing that I will come by and pick it up and this is NOT going to be delivered. Okay finally completed, she says 10-15 minutes. I'm like woah that's cool, super fast. 15 minutes go by and my girlfriend is around the corner picking up the pizza, and I get a phone call. It's a delivery guy, and not only did she put the pizza in to be delivered but she gave him the wrong address. Only off by 10 numbers though. The delivery guy was super nice and apologetic, it wasn't his fault. Thankfully I was able to text my girlfriend since she was in the store trying to pick up the pizza. The lady then tries to tell her that no, I wanted it delivered and that she was about to charge her and make her another pizza. It's like uhhh we got it already! Thankfully we live close by so it wasn't a huge deal.On the plus side, it was one of the most amazing pizzas of my entire life. It's better than any other pizza I've had and I've tried a lot of pizza. Just be weary of the lady behind the counter, it's a challenge.",4,11/24/2014,Monica's Mercato
1425,"It's been many moons since I first had a sub from Monica's...but I often dream about their meatball subs, stuffed with giant, flavorful, tender meatballs and slathered in fresh marinara, tucked away in soft baguette with the right amount of pull and crunch. I also think often about their Italian sub, I have yet to find another like it. Piled high with freshly sliced meats and drizzled in high quality olive oil and Italian spices...there is no other one like it out there. Whenever I come back to Boston, I'll be making a beeline for this store!",5,11/28/2014,Monica's Mercato
1426,This pizza is excellent and the manager Pat is a class act.,4,12/11/2014,Monica's Mercato
1427,"I would give this place 10 stars if I could.  I have tried basically every pizza place in the north end and monicas is the best, hands down.  Go in early and try the breakfast pizza!  It is absolutely amazing.",5,12/14/2014,Monica's Mercato
1428,"This is based solely on how this place is currently making Italian Subs.  Having lived in the north end for 10 years, I've been going to this place since they first proclaimed that they made the best italian sub in the city, and they absolutely did.  Every time I ordered one, it was perfect, and stacked with more meat than other other sandwich place in boston.  Fast forward to when this place really blew up, both pre and post the building expansion, the making of the italians subs has unbelievably declined.  There are so many new faces in there, which is a great sign because the place is killing it, but I get a different sub every time I walk in the door.  Some of these guys rush through it, and put more lettuce on the sub than meat, more often than not there is barely a layer of meat on there anymore.  Every now an then I'll get a sub that reminds me of the old days, and my faith is restored, then next time i got in it's barely any meat again.  I even started keeping a close eye as its being made, and when the meat is noticeably light, I ask for a little more, only to get charged extra $$ for extra meat, which is absurd.  The last time I went in I ordered a large italian, and it seemed to get made faster than I've ever seen,  I thought something seemed off, and by the time i got home and unwrapped it, it was lettuce, tomato, a thin covering of mortadella and cheese.  How do you not put salami/prosciutto  on an Italian? For $11, no one wants a mortadella and cheese sub.  Even though at Pauli's down the street the cold cuts are pre-sliced, they at least give you a consistent stack of meat on there, and are happy to listen to how you want your sub made (i.e., light on the lettuce, extra hots, etc...without taking it personal).This place has great food, and I love the owners, but somewhere along the line the consistency of how things are made has slipped big time.  If I""m paying $11 for a large italian, I sure as hell better not get a sandwich stacked with meat one time, and a sandwich with a paper thin layer of meat the next time.Get everyone behind the counter back on the same page on how to properly make a sub, write out instructions, re-train, do whatever you need to do so that I get the same great sub every time i walk in and then this place can starting claiming that they deliver the best sub in the city.",1,12/17/2014,Monica's Mercato
1429,"Went in for the ricotta pizza and the last  time I had it, it had a lot more sauce.The person behind the counter let me pick out the slice I wanted and then offered me a side of sauce and when I declined, she offered to put some directly on the pizza which I was thankful for.Very friendly service and great food (at all locations).",5,12/29/2014,Monica's Mercato
1430,"Hands down this is one of THE best places to get an Italian sub in the North End. Their bread, meats and cheeses are fresh, expertly sliced and put together into one amazing sandwich. Their olives, stuffed peppers and other appetizer type choices are always fresh and delicious. We have also bought fresh pasta and sauces that have not disappointed.",4,1/1/2015,Monica's Mercato
1431,"Absolutely delicious pizza. Not sure what kind I had because I just pointed to it in the case, but it had an egg on top. The slices are huge also, each slice is about 1/4 of the pie! I'll definitely be back.",5,1/16/2015,Monica's Mercato
1432,Stopped in last night for the first time and ordered a large pizza to go. I paid and was quoted 25 minutes for it to be ready - okay cool I'll hang out. As it got close towards the end of my wait time the girl cut up some samples of the pepperoni pizza which was much appreciated - I was starving!. After that she came to the realization that the order never made it to the kitchen - whoops! I was disappointed but not mad - stuff happens. She gave me the rest of the pizza samples and said it would be delivered to my apartment. The pizza showed up 15 minutes later along with two free beers and a note apologizing for the inconvenience. That is amazing service and why I will come back again. Thanks for the beers! (and the pizza is awesome).,4,1/17/2015,Monica's Mercato
1433,"Great fresh pasta, cured meats and Italian wine. Not much else to say.",4,1/21/2015,Monica's Mercato
1434,"I have a love hate relationship with this place. Their homemade pasta and sandwiches are delicious but they are SO SLOW. The lines here at night get long and if you are 5 deep for a sandwich order, it will feel like an eternity. The rest of the deli selection is just so so. I like the grilled vegetables but i often find a lot of the food is overcooked and has too much oil. The homemade pasta sauce is quite bland and very mild but again, the pasta is delicious and only take 3 minutes to cook in boiling water so it's a very fast meal.",4,1/22/2015,Monica's Mercato

1439,"I live in San Diego but follow my wife back to Boston when she goes for work. I go for the food. Monica's is my FIRST stop every trip for a large Italian sandwich, then it's my LAST stop as well for a sandwich to eat on the plane ride home. All I can say is they make the best sandwich I've **EVER** had, all hand sliced meats & cheeses, made to order. The employees are always nice to talk with and will serve up a small sample of anything you desire!!",5,2/19/2015,Monica's Mercato
1440,"I cannot speak to the quality of the pizza as it never arrived, however most of the service was atrocious.Monica's Mercato was my favorite place in the North End to pick up fresh cheese, pastas and sauces and I was very excited to learn about their new pizza endeavor. My first experience however, was abysmal. I called the order in for delivery and gave my address to a man who was very friendly and polite and told me my order would arrive in 30 minutes. 45 minutes later I checked my confirmation text which told me my order would be ready to pick up in 20 minutes and decided to call to make sure the delivery was all set.On the phone a woman retook my address and asked if the location was in the north end to which I said no and then offered a nearby location for context. She asked for my address again, repeated it back to me and said the pizza was on it's way and would be there within 20 minutes. Mistakes happen and at this point I was not upset.Another 40 minutes passed and I called to check on my order which I was assured was on it's way (my address was repeated again).10 minutes later I received a phone call from an angry delivery man who said there had been a misunderstanding and he would not deliver outside of the north end. Quite frustrated I told him I had been waiting over an hour and a half and had been assured multiple times it was on it's way. He continued to yell at me so I hung up to call the restaurant.The same woman answered and told me he was correct, they wouldn't deliver outside of the north end. Despite my having repeated my address to her and having told her the location was outside of the north end she insisted there was confusion on the location. The delivery man could be heard yelling and swearing in the background that he would not deliver the pizza.When I reiterated the situation the woman said she would refund me, noted that I hadn't paid yet so everything should be fine and hung up on me mid-sentence.There is nothing wrong with delivering to select locations or making a single mistake. Every restaurant has it's limits and everyone makes mistakes. However I was extremely disappointed by the multiple errors, lack of attention to delivery location and extreme lack of professionalism upon realizing the mistake.",1,2/22/2015,Monica's Mercato
1441,"Monica's has a very tasty Italian sub. I also really love the one at Patisserie on Newbury in the back bay. Both are equally great! If you are looking for Italian Imported goods you are at the right place. The fresh pasta options are also a quick dinner that leaves your taste buds very satisfied. It could be very busy here, but that just proves how wonderful this place is. I highly recommend!",5,3/1/2015,Monica's Mercato
1442,"Came in here for lunch today and was awoken by the aroma of fresh italian deli cuts and cheeses. Based on a recommendation from a friend, I tried the Chicken Parm sub and it was delicious. The chicken was very moist and fresh and the provolone was very sharp and tasty. Will be adding Monica's to the lunch rotation",4,3/11/2015,Monica's Mercato
1443,"The smell upon entering is enough to bring you back. Amazing place. Homemade bread. Super authentic Italian food, including delectable sandwiches, imported groceries, inventive creations (like a wonderful tomato jam). Awesome imported meats, including hard to find cured offerings.  Occasional wine tastings to boot. A lot of care was put into each and every selection offered here. Definitely worth a detour to go.",4,3/26/2015,Monica's Mercato
1444,"This is a great place for awesome subs. As others have mentioned, they have one of the best Italian subs around. My other favorite is their steak tip sub. They make their bread in-house I believe and jam it full of steak and other toppings. They also have a ton of ingredients if you wants to make your own plate or salad. The staff is very friendly as well.Aside from the food, they have a variety of snacks and wine/beer offerings. It looks like their snacks are imported as well as they have imported Nutella!Protip: If you're ordering a sub off the menu, would call ahead. Sometimes the line can get long and it can take up to 15 min for them to make your sub (still worth it).",5,4/2/2015,Monica's Mercato

Don't order it. Ate half and threw it away. Very disappointed after reading review of being the best Italian sub. It wasn't. The line was long too, maybe I ordered the wrong thing? And expensive for some skimpy sandwiches. It's all bread. You have been warned.",1,4/18/2015,Monica's Mercato
1447,"They have a sign out front that says best italian sandwich in Boston. We gave it a try and while I don't have a comparison in Boston it may be the best I've ever had period! The bread is soft and pillowy with the slightest bite. They lather the bread with a garlicky balsamic vinegarette and stack it with high quality meats, cheese, tomato, romaine, and red onions. This is a serious sam-ich!!! I might do arugala instead of romaine but that is a suggestion not a critique. If it ain't broke...don't fix it!!!",5,4/19/2015,Monica's Mercato
1448,"No longer the best sandwich shop in the North End (Bricco's bread wins by a long shot), but the cheese and meat variety here is unreal. The prosciutto is freshly sliced upon ordering and I have never seen that many types of pecorino cheese! Their fresh pasta and tomato jam are also both delicious. Love going here to buy all the ingredients required for an amazing dinner. Really nice staff as well.",5,4/21/2015,Monica's Mercato
1449,"Monica's is a business of their word. In their window, they have a large sign that says ""Best Italian Sub"" and it is SO, ENTIRELY, 100% TRUE. $12 for a large sub that is so quality, it will make you re-evaluate every other sub you have had in your lifetime. Not to mention, there are no extra charges for additional toppings! Monica's also has plenty of delicious prepare foods, wine, fresh pasta, Italian snacks, drinks, etc. There is also a pizzeria downstairs with slices and whole pizzas that are VERY reasonably priced given the size. LOVE LOVE LOVE MONICA'S!",5,4/21/2015,Monica's Mercato

1451,"I know most of the reviews on here are for the Italian (which is also REALLY good - I tried my fiance's!)...but the Cubano is also really amazing! They slice the pork fresh, heat it, and with the melted cheese...it's perfection. I think it is the best Cubano I have had in Boston and well worth the $12 for the large. The wait was a bit long...but worth it.",5,4/27/2015,Monica's Mercato
1452,"I agree with the sign--best Italian sub in Boston.  I mean, I haven't exactly tried every sub shop in Boston..or even close to it, but I am still willing to put all of my money on Monica's.  We stopped here on our food tour and were able to sample the sub and later came back another day and each ordered a full size sub.  We did this after completing the Freedom Trail and we were hungry!  The combination of spicy meat, crunchy vegetables, and crusty bread is delicious!  They also add some balsamic vinegar to it.  Mmmmm.  The workers are great and very personable.  The shop also carries a variety of other foods in their deli case and other Italian specialties.  As you walk around the corner to the register there is homemade pasta and sauce.  Everything looked mouthwatering.  It's really a gem of a shop!  Also, don't miss the homemade tomato jam near the register!  A great yummy souvenir to take home!",5,5/4/2015,Monica's Mercato
1453,"Go to spot for an Italian sub, they boast they have the best in the city, and they aren't lying. We lived up the street from Monica's and it was a staple for us. Their bread is great, they slice the meat for each sandwich, the cheese is cut so thin and fresh, it's like butter. The small is enough for two lunches. They also have a selection of fresh pasta, bread, stuffed olives, artichokes, cheese, meats, etc. and pre-made food (roasted vegetables, chicken, etc) that are all great for a quick dinner. Vegetarians - don't worry they make salads.When we first moved to Boston, they didn't have a menu it was kind of confusing, but since then they've put up menus which is helpful, plus the staff is great.One of the things I miss most about living in Boston is Monica's!",5,5/8/2015,Monica's Mercato
1454,"Go here. Get one of everything. Eat it. Enjoy it. Love it. There is nothing that will disappoint you here, I promise.

If it's good enough for the Bruins, it's good enough for you.",5,5/24/2015,Monica's Mercato
1455,"This place is pretty hidden as the door is on the side of the building and it goes downstairs. The slices goes for $5 but it's a pretty big slice, about a quarter of a pizza pie. The slice is thin with a crisp crust.  I ordered the sausage pizza because that was the only pizza that looked like it hadn't been sitting out for hours. Meh, I've had better pizza",2,6/16/2015,Monica's Mercato
1456,"Delicious Italian sub. Fresh bread with the perfect ingredients between. Surprisingly, the sub was a bit on the pricey side. Also carry lots of imported specialties at the deli, canned goods, etc.",5,7/7/2015,Monica's Mercato
1457,"I've had my eye on Monica's Mercato for a few months now. Their outdoor sign claiming they have the best Italian sub in Boston is a bold statement. But after seeing that their Italian was named ""Best Sandwich of 2015"" by Best of Boston, I had to see for myself.When you step inside Monica's Mercato, you're greeted by the scent of fresh olives and balsamic vinegar. You can tell the place is legit immediately. I quickly ordered a large Italian sub and then noticed that it cost $12. That is a steep price tag to say the least; especially when compared to the large $8.50 subs at Al's Cafe on State Street. Nonetheless, I persevered.Watching the guy behind the counter make the sub is a joy. He slathered the fresh roll in hots and then squeezed on some balsamic vinegar glaze before topping it with the usual Italian sub ingredients. He sliced each piece of deli meat and cheese immediately before placing it on the bread. I knew I was going to love this sandwich way before I took my first bite.I took the sub to a local park in the North End and enjoyed every bite. It's safe to say this is the best Italian sub I've ever had. It was worth every penny and I'll be going back anytime I crave an Italian.",5,7/10/2015,Monica's Mercato

1459,D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S. I was in town for business and wanted to grab food in the North End instead of sitting down for dinner. I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. Yes - it was the best Italian sandwich I have ever had. Head over there and grab something yummy to go!,5,7/18/2015,Monica's Mercato
1460,"This place is awesome. Its always a good idea to steer clear of any places claiming to have the best anything, but the Italian may truly be the best. The Italian sub is truly unique, as the cucumbers have somehow made their way into the show. Worth the price of admission alone",5,7/22/2015,Monica's Mercato
1461,Pizza was really good. It was close to most NY pizza restaurants where they pre cook the pizza and reheat it but ultimately worth the trip,4,7/25/2015,Monica's Mercato
1462,"Wow! I've stopped into Monica's a few times to pick up some groceries and beer, but had yet to try the food they prepare there...I'm sure glad I did!!I ordered a small Italian sub, along with some deli meats, a piece of cheese and a loaf of bread. Although there was a ~10 minute wait to order, I didn't mind waiting and watching the guys behind the counter work their magic. When I was finally able to eat, it was an out-of-body experience. The deli meats were perfectly sliced and very fresh. The cheese was very tasty and accompanied the meat beautifully. The real MVP was the bread. It tasted like it was baked by 80 year old Italian ladies who have been making bread for 70 years!! Delicious!!When I got going on the sub, a single tear dropped from my eye, for I had never tasted anything so glorious. The meats were sliced so thinly you could see through them. The homemade pickles and hots were not too overpowering. The bread was the perfect combination of chewy and crusty. And this was a real Italian, made with prosciutto, mortadella, and salami. The provolone they topped the sandwich with was finely cut and didn't take away from the meat and toppings at all. It was the perfect sandwich. If I could eat that sandwich everyday for the rest of my life that still might not be enough. Go to Monica's and get the Italian. And when someone asks what's the best advice you've ever been given, remember Mike G from Yelp who directed you to Monica's.",5,7/26/2015,Monica's Mercato
1463,"I didn't think the Italian sub was that great and am frankly confused over the hype. While the meat was tender, the sandwich itself wasn't all that flavorful, and the bread tasted day old. My boyfriend ordered the meatball sub, and noted how few meatballs were inside. The service was also extremely slow. Really underwhelmed by Monica's, especially given the rave reviews of Yelpers and friends alike.",2,7/26/2015,Monica's Mercato

NO WAY *BRICCO-No flavor to sub-staff looks like they are mad all the time :-(-mostly eating bread and no cold cuts -kinda dry *Monica's- friendly staff - larger sub packed with fresh meats - fresh bread- flavorful,tasty,....simply delicious To sum it up !!!!! Don't look for any thing better just make this a must stop place for all your Italian goodies !!!!!! The Italian is the best :-)",5,7/31/2015,Monica's Mercato
1465,"The best pizza in the north end!The sauce is just sweet enough without being ragu, the crust is flaky and right, the staff is courteous (and funny to boot) and the wine selection they've got is perfect if you feel like getting a little fancy with your night in. They're also prompt with orders, so, unlike most pizzerias, 20 minutes means 20 minutes!",5,8/1/2015,Monica's Mercato
1466,"Monica's is the worst dollar value in the north end. I got a large tuna and my coworker had a large meatball and while the ingredients were certainly superior to my go-to sandwich shop, ""Going Banana's"", the portion size is insulting for the price. I paid $12 for a sandwich that could fit comfortably inside a Pringle's can. It was the approximate width and length of a premature baby's forearm. I own watch bands thicker than the slice of bread that was served to me. To call this a sandwich is to spit in the face of Truth; this was a glorified breadstick. My coworker's meatball sub was littered with four to five acorn sized lumps of ground chuck that would make Spaghetio's meatballs look the size of grapefruits. In her words ""the only redeeming factor is the sauce.""My overall experience was not aided by the fact that seven guests who ordered after us received their sandwiches first. I can only speculate the reason for the hold-up was a shortage of the nano-technology instruments necessary to construct this microscopic meal.",2,8/5/2015,Monica's Mercato
1467,"Best place in the North End to pop in for a sandwich to-go. I always go for their caprese or italian sandwiches. I would also highly recommend their pizza shop below. The pizza is always fresh, crispy, and they have a great variety. Great owners and friendly employees!",5,8/6/2015,Monica's Mercato
1468,"We recently visited Monica's and ordered large chicken parm and meatball parm sandwiches to go. The bread still had a great texture and didn't get soggy after walking with the sandwiches for 30 minutes after ordering them. Both were HUGE and delicious; however, I am not sure they are worth 12 dollars each. The price is definitely a bit stiff. It also seemed odd that the meatball parm had provolone cheese instead of the traditional mozzarella. The provolone was not bad, but tasted different than a traditional meatball parm hero. The shop was crowded on a Sunday afternoon, which caused a 20 min wait for the sandwiches too. Overall, the sandwiches were pricy, but definitely had a lot of flavor and satisfied our italian sandwich craving. We will most likely be back.",4,8/17/2015,Monica's Mercato
1469,"Was roaming around the north end. Didn't expect to actually get anything for lunch but came into Monica's and was enticed by the ""Cuban"" sandwich on the menu. $9 for a small. A small is massive. This sandwich is pretty spot on for a Cuban even though they do not used Pulled Pork. Instead they have Roasted Pork, Ham, Pickles, Onions, Mayo, Mustard, and Swiss. Very delicious. I was full off of half of a small. Will definitely come back here again.",5,8/18/2015,Monica's Mercato
1470,Fantastic sandwiches. Very fresh ingredients. Kind and prompt service. Really nice selection. Fair value for money,5,8/23/2015,Monica's Mercato
1471,"The most overrated, skimpiest Italian ""sub"" I've ever had. We paid over $24 for two of them, and only did so because of the high local praise. If this is how they do Italian subs in Boston, I'll *never* order an Italian sub in Boston again.Monica's ""famous"" and ""best"" Italian sub is SO small! And it's ridiculously light on ingredients, too. AND, to make Yelp matters worse, they forgot to put the provolone on our subs. Because their deli functions as a to-go counter, and you can't actually see them assembling your sandwich, we were already a mile away before I noticed. What a shitty feeling.Anybody can make an Italian sub better than this. Anybody. There have been recent studies that suggest that when people know what they are eating and/or drinking is expensive, their brains trick their tastebuds into thinking what they are eating and/or drinking tastes better than it really is. Don't let this $12 Italian sub fool you. If I paid $6 or $7 for this sub, I'd still feel ripped off.",1,9/3/2015,Monica's Mercato
1472,So fresh.  Meats and cheeses all sliced to order.  The bread (made downstairs to feed the supply) is worth the trip alone.  Not too crusty or too much.  Grabbed a menu on the way out and will likely be calling in future orders so we can just swing by and pick them up! Italian sub is amazing!,5,9/7/2015,Monica's Mercato
1473,"GROSS, WORST Italian sub I have ever had and I was drunk....what does that say??? Horrible service, a bunch of Spanish, non English  guys making your sandwich....North End or Mexico.  The only reason I ended up here was because Salumeria Italiana on Richmond Street was already closed.  If you want a FANTASTIC Italian sub, try Salumeria Italiana  on Richmond...stay away from Monicas.  Must be all of the tourists giving Monicas great reviews, because anyone who is from the North End, knows where to go.  I would never return on recommend.",1,9/8/2015,Monica's Mercato
1474,"Fast, simple , and accurate review for people who don't want to read a novel finding out if a place is good.Ordered: ( 3/3 stars)I had the Italian sub. It was delicious. The bread was perfect. The meat was perfect. Everything melts in your mouth. They do have a large size option, but the regular was very adequate in making me full. The price was very reasonable for being in Boston and for the amount of food you're getting.Service: (1/1 star)Great, friendly service.Cleanliness and parking (0/1 star)Clean place. Parking is hard to find. No tables to sit and eat at inside or near by. You can walk to the park and enjoy it there.I'm a regular. If you like subs. This is a must !",4,9/8/2015,Monica's Mercato
1475,"Tasty Italian subs (a little pricey), great service, nice market. But I had a Cuban sandwich the other day. Epic failure. Simply not Cubano. But the italian...oh yeah!",4,9/11/2015,Monica's Mercato
1476,Absolutely amazing Italian sub.  I am on a plane flying home and am in utter awe.  Almost feel like flying the red-eye back to Boston to get another sandwich.,5,9/18/2015,Monica's Mercato
1477,"Yes, the subs are a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.  I'm a big eater and could not comfortably finish the large Italian sub.  It comes on nice, crusty bread with really good meat and cheese.  I'm afraid I might go back enough that, eventually, I will be able to take a large down in 1 sitting.",5,9/21/2015,Monica's Mercato
1478,"This italian sub makes me regret my ignorance for the last 20 years.As a long-time Boston resident, I consider myself well versed on the dining inside the city limits. However, when the girlfriend told me there was a place in the North End with Boston's best italian sandwich, I was taken aback. The name was unfamiliar and I couldn't imagine where it could possibly be. To my chagrin, Monica's Mercato was publicly located on my almost-daily route to a buddies. We stepped inside, and swooned. It feels like what I imagine a local deli in suburban Italy to feel like, stocked with cute Italian products and with meat hanging everywhere.After my first swallow of their sandwich, I could have kissed their doorstep. I consider italian sandwiches plain and tend to order something else, but even I could not help but marvel at this one's flavor. The meat, so delicately cut, dissolves into fatty goodness. I liked this sandwich so much that I came for the next two days and ordered the italian again, as well as a cuban.Learn from my mistakes, and get familiar with Monica's Mercato.",5,9/21/2015,Monica's Mercato
1479,Unbelievable. ...best Italian subs since leaving Philly! The bread is baked at the store.  The meat is freshly sliced for each sandwich.  I was in heaven.  I will be back!,5,9/26/2015,Monica's Mercato
1480,"WHAT A FIND in the north end!!! Locals coming in and out. simple, well made, fresh sandwiches from the counter. Lots of cool fun items for your pantry to purchase.the guys behind the counter and the check out clerk were super kind!Will be a go to spot for lunch if i am ever back in boston.PS the sandwiches are HUGE. if you are having a late or light lunch... split one!!!",4,10/7/2015,Monica's Mercato

1482,"I needed to bring a large salad to a party and didn't have time to make one. After seeing the reviews for Monica's, I thought it'd be the perfect place to call. They agreed to make the large garden salad (enough to serve 8) same day, though that's not something they normally do. They weren't able to give me the price over the phone, but I know the same salad in Brookline runs $30. You can imagine my surprise when the register read $50! They told me they ""put so many fresh vegetables in"" - which I didn't ins impressive as it's a GARDEN SALAD. Between the pricing and the attitude, I will never visit this place again. Would have been well worth the drive to Brookline to save $20!",1,10/12/2015,Monica's Mercato
1483,"This place has great sandwiches, antipasta, wine, and some grocery items.  But the real star here is the selection of fresh pasta: spaghetti, lingini, penne, several kinds of ravioli, etc.  Once you master how long to cook the pasta (not difficult), it's almost like you're eating in Italy.  This place is a real find!",5,10/17/2015,Monica's Mercato
1484,"On a beautiful fall day we really wanted some food for the north end that we could take to the park and enjoy in the sun. Monica's was perfect. We ordered an italian that was amazing. Additionally, I ordered a caprese with salami. I didn't want to come to a salumeria and only get vegetables! They made my special request with no problem and the sandwich did not disappoint. SO much salami. Already looking forward to coming back to Monica's. The ordering counter was a bit confusing but everyone was very nice and helpful. When you decide what you'd like to order just assert yourself to the front so you don't get cut by locals who know better! Then make your way around to the other side of the store to check out and pay. Enjoy!",5,10/19/2015,Monica's Mercato
1485,Don't believe any hater on here. This place is 100% legit and serves the most perfect Italian sandwich known to mankind. The pizza shop underneath is fantastic too. Not to be missed in the North End.,5,10/23/2015,Monica's Mercato

1487,"Put simply: Monica's is proof that if you have an outstanding product, people will put up with any other faults to your business. Their ingredients are some of the best I've had ever, and all the hype around their Italian sub is for real. It's incredible, worth the 12 dollars, and keeps me coming back despite how annoyed I get every time I go there.Here's a brief rundown on what happens every time I get Monica's: -I call in my order for a sub, which is written down at the register on the other side of the store from the deli counter-I'm told it will be 15 minutes-I show up 15 minutes later. There are people in the store ordering food. There doesn't seem to be any organization to what's happening at the deli counter. No one is actively taking orders. Customers are swarming, service is slow. I get it, it's good food, it takes a minute to prepare.-My order is taped up behind the deli counter, on the other side from where the guy making sandwiches is-I have to awkwardly push to the front of the crowd and tell them I placed an order for pick-up. They look confused, then notice my order and tell me they'll make it now.-I wait 15 minutes, then get my sub.Once again, Monica's has top-of-the-line ingredients and for $12, I can eat the best Italian sub I've ever had AND have enough leftover for lunch the next day. I will keep coming back regardless if their efficiency improves but PLEASE fix this and make my life easier. If you want to get rid of take-out orders, fine, but don't offer it and then make me show up and then cut people in line just to remind the workers to make my sandwich. Train someone to be in charge of taking orders from the customers and keeping things organized based on when an order is placed. Every recommendation I give of this place is preempted with a warning. I wish it wasn't that way because the food is really that good.",3,11/2/2015,Monica's Mercato
1488,This place is awesome! Very helpful and suggested the best meats and cheeses! Peppers stuffed with provolone and prosciutto are a must. Will return before leaving town to get some more my travels. Check them out!,5,11/2/2015,Monica's Mercato
1489,"If I could eat here every day I would. Get the large Italian with red peppers and extra balsamic. Add artichoke hearts if you're feeling extra fancy. My only comment is that they need to standardize their pricing? Sometimes I have to pay extra for my additions, sometimes I don't! This place is amazing.",5,11/2/2015,Monica's Mercato
1490,"Since moving in to the neighborhood nearly 4 years ago, I can safely say that Monica's makes, hands down, the best Italian sub I've ever had. Along with all the other obvious meats, Monica's is the only place I know that also puts prosciutto in them! I've steered away from their prepared foods section (not because of any quality or taste concern) and now usually get either subs, fresh pasta, or deli-sliced meats and cheeses.",5,11/21/2015,Monica's Mercato
1491,"I will admit that the food is good, but the service is borderline pathetic.  The last three times I have called in orders I have shown up only to be told that they did not have what I ordered. If you go to Monica's just know that chances are whatever you ordered will not be waiting for you and you will be waiting in the very long line you proactively tried to avoid by calling in.",1,11/22/2015,Monica's Mercato
1492,BEST SANDWICHES IN BOSTON!!!!! I love Monica's.  Luckily I live within walking distance.  They also have great cheeses that I often purchase when I want cheese and crackers.  I like that they sell single beers too!They also sell beers in 6 packs and they have a variety of wine.,5,11/25/2015,Monica's Mercato
1493,"Monica's does make awesome subs. However, they now charge on average $2 to request extra condiments.  I can see if you want extra main ingredients but $2 per extra pickles or hots.  Not a good thing. Seems cheap. $12 is pretty high for the sub but worth it.. but $14 to add extra hots.  Come on!",3,11/29/2015,Monica's Mercato
1494,"Some of the most amazing food I have EVER had. You cannot go wrong at Monica's. I have had the fresh ravioli, the pizza, and almost every sub and it is unbeatable. The prices are extremely reasonable for the quality product they serve. The chicken cutlet sub is the best sandwich I have ever had. If you are looking for a take out meal in the North End, it doesn't get any better.",5,12/3/2015,Monica's Mercato
1495,"Tried Monica's after receiving a great recommendation from a friend. To say the least, it did not disappoint. I tried the Italian Steak and Italian Sub, and both were spectacular.  Two of the best sandwiches I have had while living in Boston. Highly recommended if you are a fan of a classic Italian sandwich.",5,12/22/2015,Monica's Mercato
1496,"AMAZING Italian sub. Especially after a night of drinking. Shared the sub with 4 people and it was the perfect serving. Prosciutto, sharp Parmesan, and the balsamic vinegar and olive oil definitely made the sand which above par. Great take out place, and to mention all the little Italian desserts, biscuits, pastas on the shelves! They had little pizza samplers which we ALL thought was the best part. Will definitely come by before the end of our trip to have a full slice!",5,2/13/2016,Monica's Mercato
1497,If you work in the city and are in close proximity to the North End this is a must stop for lunch. The sandwiches are some of the best that I have ever had and all the ingredients are extremely fresh and most imported from Italy. Steep on the prices 9 dollars for a medium 12 dollars for a large but the portions are quite large. Also their selections of meats and pastas imported from Italy and local farmers are very good as well.,5,2/15/2016,Monica's Mercato
1498,"I think I'm in love with this place. As soon as you walk in you can see all the meat lined up and you can feel the genuine quality of the food that is served here. I ordered the Italian sandwich large and shared it with a girl friend of mine. It's 12 dollars and I thought it was worth every penny. You go in and you can watch the sandwich  artists work as they slice your mortadella, prosciutto, salami, and provolone into nice thin slices. Next time I visit Boston I am DEFINITELY getting this sandwich again.",5,2/21/2016,Monica's Mercato
1499,"I'm not a fan of Italian subs but Monica's is the exception!  It's $12 for the larger size, which has more goodness in the sandwich.  The bread was chewy and fresh.  All of the meat (including the prosciutto) and cheese were freshly sliced before your eyes as they were making the sandwich.  Moistened with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, it was delectable.  I had the smaller size for lunch, which was still tasty later as a midnight snack!",5,2/23/2016,Monica's Mercato
1500,"The place is really nice, people were too but I wasn't impressed with the Italian sangy (allegedly best in Boston). I had very high hopes for it but the flavor wasn't there. They cut all the cold cuts fresh but the prosciutto was at the end of its life and had very hard parts I couldn't bite or even chew through which was disappointing but even without that the flavors just weren't there. I didn't try anything else but it all looked amazing, certainly worth trying other things.",3,2/24/2016,Monica's Mercato
1501,"Beware that they take FOREVER to make a sandwich. I definitely recommend calling ahead. There isn't really a clear menu, so it's hard to tell what the options are. That being said, their sandwiches and salads are delicious.",4,3/13/2016,Monica's Mercato
1502,"I moved in down the street and popped in last night after some friends raved about this place. I had the Italian sub (duh) and I watched enraptured as they slice the meats (3 kinds!) and cheeses (paper thin so it melts in your mouth) in front of me. Have I mentioned that they use real crusty Italian bread? Omg, soooo good.Also, the service was SO friendly! Finally, they have homemade pasta that they sell by the pound. Mouthwatering!!!!",5,3/30/2016,Monica's Mercato
1503,"Hands down, best Italian sub I've ever had. Most likely best in Boston. After having one of their Italian subs it's hard to compare anything else. Nothing is just quite as good. The meats hanging on the wall when you walk in, the way they slice the meat and cheese thinner than paper, and combining it with the freshest bread out there makes for an amazing experience on your taste palet. Doesn't really get more authentic than this! Absolute must try if your in the Boston area.",5,4/2/2016,Monica's Mercato
1504,"Monica's is an awesome little walk-in deli and market in the North End.  This has become my go-to place on nice days when I want to grab some take-away food, and walk down to the harbor for people and boat watching.  the bread is super fresh and fillings top notch.  My favs are the chicken parm, a killer Italian sub, and the Italian steak tips with extra hot peppers.  Delish.  You can also pick up cheese, wine, boutique sodas, and fresh pasta.",4,4/4/2016,Monica's Mercato
1505,A terrific little deli in the heart of the North End. Voted best Italian sandwich by Best of Boston and definitely for a reason. Great quality meats and cheeses and a real authentic feel in the store. The exception to this would be the guys behind the counter but they are always joking and are great with interacting with customers. A lot of imported high quality goods that you can't really find in other stores. Two things that stop me from giving the full five stars is sometimes freshness of bread and pastas is questionable and second is that most things are quite overpriced even for high quality imported brands.,4,4/6/2016,Monica's Mercato
1506,Some of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Italian sub and chicken cutlet are both mouth-watering! (and big!) Guys who work the counter are always so friendly.,5,4/7/2016,Monica's Mercato

1508,"The steak tips sub is one of the most amazing sandwiches I've ever had! I eat it at least once every two weeks! The Italian sub is so good, too! One of my favorite go-to spots since I've been living in the north end over this past year!",5,4/10/2016,Monica's Mercato
1509,"Voted best Italian at some point in Boston, and it is worth the hype. The italian steak tip sub is supreme there too. They have an excellent selection of deli, all sorts of stuff and beers too. Anytime I am over the north end during lunch time I like to stop in here and get something.",5,4/14/2016,Monica's Mercato
1510,"Best authentic Italian sub around. Bread is always fresh and chewy, cold cuts like prosciutto and soppressata are sliced to order. Subs are always packed with meats and cheeses, no skimping here. You get what you pay for: good quality ingredients. Your stomach will appreciate it!",5,4/21/2016,Monica's Mercato
1511,"Monica's Mercato is that classic Italian deli you dream about. Prosciutto hangs from the ceiling and they have a wide varied of grocery items you would not see in any typical grocery store. The old school environment tops it off as you wait for one of their amazing traditional Italian subs. Note: NO Seating In the DELI. Food: After some careful brainstorming, I decided to order the Italian Steak Tips sandwich with everything in it. My girlfriend chose the Caprese Sandwich. Since they did not have any seating, we decided to walk to the park and enjoy our subs there with the moonlight glowing and downtown Boston as our background. Quite romantic lol. My Steak tips sub was outstanding. Everything from the balsamic dressing to the veggies worked so well with the char of each steak cube. This is sandwich packed with meat so come here with an appetite. My girlfriend loved her sandwich as well. She let me know that her sandwich was top notch as far as quality and sometimes simplistic is key. Overall, we loved our subs and I have to go back here when I travel back to Boston. 5 out of 5 sub. Don't come here if you are looking for trendy or fluff subs. Totally traditional style Italian deli, the way I prefer. Hope you enjoyed my review :D",5,4/22/2016,Monica's Mercato
1512,Hands down the best chicken parm and Italian sub I've ever had. You cannot find anything more authentic and fresh. The deli has an array of fresh meats and cheeses along with Italian favorites. They carry local dairy products and also have fresh pasta and pasta sauces to take home and cook. It can get very busy from 5-7 on most work nights but it's worth the wait.,4,4/26/2016,Monica's Mercato
1513,"Great sandwiches-- super fresh and reasonably priced. I got the turkey sub and my friends got the Italian sub. We waited about 20-25 minutes in line, but it was well worth the wait!",5,4/30/2016,Monica's Mercato
1514,"Because of the reviews, we ended up getting the large Italian sub.  This sub is not like what we are used to in Ohio.  Crammed full of Italian meats and cheeses freshly sliced in front of you it is wonderful. Now all of this takes time. Supplementing it with a salad, one sub served both of us two dinners leaving us with spare calories for Mike's Pastry. Roaming through the store besides meat and cheeses, they had homemade pasta, wine and an assortment of imported grocery items. I thought the prices were fair. We almost got the Cubano but thought that was a better fit for the Mission in San Francisco. Deli case and fresh pasta case (on the other side of the wall) looked wonderful. I would have bought more but my suitcase was stuffed.",5,5/1/2016,Monica's Mercato

1516,"Great, high-quality sandwiches for an excellent value.  We popped in here for a quick, late lunch upon arriving in Boston and we're not disappointed. I'm a sucker for Italian meats so the Italian sub was calling my name.  It was delicious...make sure you don't skip on the hots (you may even want to ask for extra!)  If we had time while visiting, it would have been fun to buy groceries (pasta, wine, etc.) from there and cook dinner one night. I would recommend this if you're staying in an apartment on the North End for a while in Boston.",4,5/16/2016,Monica's Mercato

1518,"I grew up on the east coast and worked at a great sub shop making sandwiches in Md. This place is sadly overrated. Balsamic vinegar has no place on a true Italian Sub. What you'll experience is a sub made by non-Italians who can't even get your order correct. No onions or pepper relish even when you ask for it from the English-challenged crew.I was sorely disappointed after great expectations. They even used great meat and cheese that was cut fresh so I was sure they couldn't miss. They did. For all of the uninitiated out there, let me give you a secret. Go to the Italian deli of your choice and get your own meats (imported dry salami, capacolla ham and provolone cheese. Get the best and freshest Italian sub roll you can find. Combine imported olive oil, light vinegar (white way better than balsamic), maybe some salt pepper and oregano and your done. Just combineCut the bread and pull out the middle fluff. Pour a slight amount of your oil vinegar mix on the bread first. Four slices of capacolla make the base, 3 slices of provolone and four slices of salami next. Throw on shredded lettuce, tomatoes and onions. Salt and pepper crucial, which this place forgot. Then throw on oil- vinegar mix last.News - if you use best ingredients, you have the best sub. Balsamic vinegar is for those Subway customers who happen upon a new place in the city.",2,5/22/2016,Monica's Mercato
1519,"One of the best subs I've ever clinched my teeth into.The Italian Sub offers eaters meat on meat action that makes my mouth water. In each bite you can taste the different flavors like - ham here, provolone here, onion here, salami here. The meat was thinly sliced and stacked upon a fresh and chewy, yet crusty on the outside roll.If you are visiting from out of town, I suggest buying an extra one and storing that baby in the hotel fridge because it's definitely the ultimate post-bar snack during the late times.",5,5/29/2016,Monica's Mercato
1520,"True to their word, they really do have the best Italian sub in Boston! Freshly toasted crunchy bread stuffed and I mean really stuffed with delicious cold cuts. High quality cold cuts too, like thin slices of prosciutto stacked high... Yummmmm! $12 for a large that's large enough to share, definitely a deal! Get it with extra hots to make it extra juicy.",5,6/12/2016,Monica's Mercato
1521,"Great selection of imported soppressata, prosciutto (several different DOP varieties - Parma, San Daniele, etc.) and every other salumi you can imagine. It's a good spot to try new cured meats most Americans don't usually see, such as the bresaola, lardo, and speck. I can't be sure, but the meats seem to be pretty legit, without the preservatives and sulfites that ruin American versions of cured pork products.Yes, the Italian sub is spectacular (and expensive, but that's because its ingredients are much higher quality than your typical corner pizza parlor) but the prepared foods are also really great. I like the empanadas a lot. The homemade pastas are great (especially ravioli).The staff are super friendly, and I used to live around the corner so I'd go in all the time. They always let me try some things before I bought them, cutting off pieces of cheese I'd never heard of and telling me about all the different varieties they have.Monica's is amazing",5,6/13/2016,Monica's Mercato

1524,"A fun new addition to the Seaport, Madras Dosa Co. brings some interesting variety to the neighborhood! This was my first time trying a dosa, and I loved it. Super light yet crispy texture with my choice of fillings, the closest comparison is a crepe but that's not quite right. Since I wasn't familiar with the menu items or way to order, that part was a little confusing. At their suggestion, I tried a dosa with beef, onions, and cheese, which was almost an Indian version of a burrito. At $16 it was more than I'd have typically paid for lunch, but this was new, delicious, and a lot of food. I'm still not certain which sauces I ended up with for dipping, but they were all delicious! One thing that might be helpful for newcomers is some suggested combinations and/or photos.Looking forward to my next visit!",5,7/7/2021,Madras Dosa
1525,"Let me start by saying that I am from South India (and have family in Kerala and Tamil Nadu) so I've had my share of excellent dosas in my life. This place has potential and that's it. The whole thing just falls flat on its face. Let's start with the menu- they don't actually have a menu of dosas like masala dosa, neer dosa, paper dosa. Rather they've created diy/chipotle style menu where you add every single ""topping"" to your dosa for an additional outrageous $1 charge per ""topping"". You don't put toppings on dosa, that's not a thing. This does not work. You have to essentially try to recreate your own masala dosa if you want one but the ""spicy"" potatoes were bland, the onions were raw, and the podi was in disgusting clumps. Then they have weird toppings like straight up putting chunks of samosa or cheese (!!!) in a dosa. The dosa itself was fine, not bad but nothing to write home about either. Then there are the sides the dosa comes with. The sambar was watery, weirdly a little sweet, and lacked flavor. The chutney was also watery and lacked flavor. Then the last side was what I can only guess was supposed to be rasam but doesn't deserve to have the name because it tasted terrible-it was this strange blend of different sweet flavors it nearly made me gag. The container they serve the food in is also strange and leaves no room to actually eat your dosa with the sides. We also tried the samosa chaat and abandoned it after a few bites-the samosa was cold and so soggy you couldn't even cut through it. Was excited at the prospect of a dosa place in Boston but Madras Dosa does dosa a disservice. Their dosa is definitely not the answer. I think they could do a good job if they took a step back, thought what would a dosa restaurant that tried to succeed in Chennai look like, and then tried to create that, they might have a chance.",1,7/11/2021,Madras Dosa
1526,"We had an awesome first time dosa experience at Madras Dosa. There were so many delicious filling options that it was tough to decide, so we asked for a recommendation. We ended up ordering chicken dosas with cheese, onions, and Indian Lays chips. They were so filling and tasty, and we loved the dipping sauces on the side. The dosa itself was flavorful and light. We can't wait to come back to try the other fillings and to explore the other menu items. he",5,7/16/2021,Madras Dosa
1527,I really liked this new addition to seaport. Fast food style dosa with a twist. This is not your traditional dosa place that you would find in India. And that is what I liked about the place. Something different while giving a taste of the real thing. Its about time we have an indian/south indian chipotle and this place has potential to be just that!,4,7/20/2021,Madras Dosa
1528,"Visited on a Thursday afternoon for lunch with a couple of friends in July 2021. There has been a buzz since this place opened it's doors. It's at a great spot in the middle of Seaport district.They weren't open for indoor dining when we visited but they have a few outdoor tables which I believe is shared among all the eateries in that lane.We tried 3 things - Chicken Dosa, Chicken Dosa with Spicy Podi, Filter Coffee (From a machine) and Lamb Pulao.Not to be too critical but their sambar and one of their chutneys needs work. You could taste the sambar powder in the sambar. Out of the two chutneys, one was unusually sour but there was another which was good!Meat in the Lamb Pulao was filled with flavor.I wish to go there again to try other items off their menu.",3,7/24/2021,Madras Dosa
1529,"The dosa didn't have the right fermentation as it was missing the sourness which comes with great dosas. The chutney was ice cold? Why? The sambhar was  lukewarm with a disappointing taste. I have question for the chef who came up with an idea of putting a dry minced chicken inside a dry dosa, what the hell? The masala soda was too sweet to drink. I rather eat sugar. Also, where's the fizz bro?This place is sorry excuse for dosa. The do have good packaging though but food is below par.",2,7/24/2021,Madras Dosa
1530,Great food and awesome ambiance. Placed the order and it came up fast. Loved it all around,5,7/25/2021,Madras Dosa
1531,This is awful Indian food at it very worst. I love dosas and expected them to be fresh and spicy. Instead I got soggy and tasteless. And the prices are not cheap either. This is worse than Mall food at four times the cost.,1,7/25/2021,Madras Dosa
1532,"Disappointing. The write ups painted a pretty big expectation for this place and I haven't been more underwhelmed. First there are no suggestions. Just a list of toppings for $1+. Most of these are raw and unseasoned. I got a hot pancake with cold potatoes, raw onions and shredded Mexican cheese (I assumed cheese was paneer). This place will not last.",1,7/30/2021,Madras Dosa
1533,"Authentic flavors. I liked the concept of ""add-ons"" to the plain dosa, making it customizable per your liking. Dosa batter must have been beautifully fermented since it has the right balance of flavors and crisp. Not so expensive considering the location (Seaport district, Boston). Idli sambar was nice. Filter coffee reminded of one back home!",5,7/31/2021,Madras Dosa
1534,Very good dosa. Visited from San Francisco and was trying to find good food in Boston. The place was run efficiently and love all the dosa selection. Highly recommend this place.,4,7/31/2021,Madras Dosa
1535,Absolutely fantastic food and generous portions! Good amount of spice and great mango lassi,5,8/4/2021,Madras Dosa
1536,"I ordered a dosa with chicken, potato, onion, cheese, and carrot today. It was really delicious!!! Everyone in Boston should try this place. Oh! Their mango lassi was so good! The lassi was better than any other Indian restaurant in Boston, in my opinion.",5,8/10/2021,Madras Dosa
1537,"5 stars because even though this place is still working out smaller aspects of the overall concept, it has so much potential and I'm so glad it's here. I got a dosa, mango lassi, aloo tikka, and samosa. The dosa was good for a fast casual dosa - perfect for a quick lunch when I'm craving one, while still super accessible and easy to grab. I found the rasam very sweet, but really liked the sambar and coconut chutney it came with. The aloo tikka and samosa were very, very good. The mango lassi was very good and I think alone worth a visit. I'm very excited to come back! I saw there were sweet dosa fillings and very much want to try a dosa with strawberry, lays, and ghee or one with ice cream and fruit.",5,8/12/2021,Madras Dosa
1538,I got the spicy potatoes with chicken dosa. It is similar to a crepe and it came with dipping sauces. I think it was filling for a lunch and full of flavor. The spicy sauce was my favorite.,4,8/17/2021,Madras Dosa
1539,"I found this restaurant while on a business trip. Coming from Chicago I have a sense of what good Indian food tastes like. This place was more healthy than a traditional Indian restaurant, and I really enjoyed seeing the meal preparation. The taste was good and I would return! Try the masala dosa!",4,8/20/2021,Madras Dosa
1540,"I rarely post reviews but Madras Dosa was just too good! I got my dosa with lamb, potatoes, cheese, and onions. Much bigger serving than I expected and 10x as delicious as I thought it would be! Adding some great flavors to the Seaport",5,8/21/2021,Madras Dosa
1541,"I'm sure brown folk will always be more critical of Indian food....but this place was a pleasant surprise. Came in from out of town and brought my partner here because I miss dosa from home. Huge pros: the speed at which one can get a personalized dosa with all sorts of filling options, sweet and savory; the additional menu options; the tamarind based chutney was a HUGE hit. Cons: if you're very particular about your Indian food, you might have small nitpicking about flavor profiles. But for a random place in seaport? We were very happy, and clearly so were the other numbers of brown folk that came by to try this. We recommend a dosa with the potatoes and spicy podi, though next time we might be adding onions and the chilis. Also, we were fans of the Pav Bhaji (bread toasted up with a dal based dish you can spoon on for some open faced sandwich style eating). Very likely we come back the next time we're in the area.",4,8/29/2021,Madras Dosa
1542,"Not a bad option since there are no good alternative in the SPD. The coffee is too expensive for a machine / instant coffee. Also - for chicken - its the same chicken kheema on different bases.  The seating (or lack there of) is outside control of the owners, but the food definitely is and can be improved upon.",4,9/6/2021,Madras Dosa
1543,"This place was located in walking distance from our hotel so we came here twice during our trip. This probably tells you that the first time, we liked it enough to come back. My fiance had Dosa and a Potato Sandwich, I ordered Rasam and Pani Poori. On top of that we got Chai and Filter Coffee, which were both really good! The Pani Poori was fantastic and very authentic in flavor. The Rasam on the other hand was terrible - too much tamrind, too much oil, too many seeds. I couldn't have more than three spoons. My fiancé was very happy with his food so we were overall satisfied enough to come back for breakfast the next day. That time I ordered Idli + Sambar. First, they forgot to make my order and I ended up waiting for almost 30mins to receive my food. When I finally got it, I was very underwhelmed. The Idli were probably not fermented enough because they weren't fluffy at all. I also wasn't happy to discovered that the sambar had been poured over them, as I prefer to have it on the side. All in all, this place is a mixed bag. Some dishes are really good, others simply aren't.",3,9/12/2021,Madras Dosa
1544,"Was not at all happy with the food. I thought they would have decent South Indian food but it was bad. I ordered dosa with spicy potato and podi idli. Idli was ok but dosa was bad. It was not at all hot and potato masala did not even have salt, This is not the masala you have in South Indian dosa. Also, the batter was not properly fermented. I had ordered sandwich (which I was skeptical from the beginning) and it was bad. The same potato paste from dosa was in it. No butter or chutney. Not sure where the chef tried sandwich in India. And filter coffee was from the machine. So it was not filter coffee but basically coffee water. If a South Indian has food here then I guarantee they will be ashamed I won't recommend this place to anyone. Would give zero starts if I could",1,10/3/2021,Madras Dosa
1545,"I'm a vegetarian and ordered a spicy potato dosa and they handed me a lamb dosa (labeled as spicy potato) and by the time I ate it I had already started eating the lamb dosa. Terrible experience. Also, the paneer sandwich sucks.",1,10/8/2021,Madras Dosa
1546,Oh my god - LOVE the masala dosa. Found this place by chance and surprised at the neg reviews!!,5,10/18/2021,Madras Dosa
1547,"Worst service, confused and unfriendly staff. Ordered masala dosa with egg, received Dosa without egg.Be careful with the addings.",1,10/19/2021,Madras Dosa
1548,"Alright, so Dosa on Seaport! What else one could ask! specially, when you get plethora of toppings and ability to customize per your need. You can freaking put Horlicks on a Dosa, not sure if that's a thing!But the quality of dosa is sub par. I got an Egg-Masala Dosa. They charged me $1 for eggs but I could not find any egg on my dosa. The masala was not tasty it was just meh!  The quantity of dosa was actually good. It was one of those thick kinds, that you get in Tamil Nadu.If you have a car and coming to Madras Dosa Co., instead of finding the parking and eating at this place, take a detour and go to somerville, and eat at Dosa and Curry, that serves much better dosa.If you want to eat at Seaport, then find something else. There are many good options!",2,10/20/2021,Madras Dosa
1549,"Too expensive and although the packaging looks elegant, it feels excessive and a waste of resources. Food tastes good, slightly above average. But for the money, you would expect larger portions.  Mango lassi was awesome!",4,10/23/2021,Madras Dosa
1550,"Had a great experience here and will be back when we come back to Boston. We came here twice during our stay and the consistency was great and we had no issues. The dosas were perfectly cooked and everything is customizable. We did ours with the spicy potato, cheese and green chili's for a kick. The chili definitely brought the heat so if you don't like super spicy maybe skip out on that. Also, the packaging for the dosa is on point- it would be great to-go because nothing would get soggy or spill. We also got dahi puri- which was surprisingly tasty. The kitchen was clean and everything was made fresh. It's a smaller footprint inside so less seating room . The masala chai was also surprisingly yummy- we grabbed some and walked the harbor.Something that would help this place is having someone walk you through the menu and explain what their most popular dosas and menu items are etc. Especially for people who are new to this cuisine and wanting to try it out.",5,11/7/2021,Madras Dosa
1551,"Love the Dosa... Great portions. Very diverse menu that is all about the Dosa, but also items to please a dosa doubter! Great location. The containers are genious! Great for take out and making eating a dosa extremely easy next door at the Beer Garden. Portions are generous and price reasonable.",5,11/26/2021,Madras Dosa
1552,"Idli was soft and fluffy , chutneys were tastyOverall food was good quality and tasty",5,12/5/2021,Madras Dosa
1553,"My 4 year old recently became obsessed with ""Mira, Royal Detective"" on Disney +, and she begged to find a place that had crispy samosas. Since this is the only Indian place in the neighborhood, off we went. Ordering was pretty confusing in my opinion, but what we got was delicious! It's kid friendly and a great addition to the neighborhood. I'd say it's better than Chipotle next door and most similar to Paris Creperie only spicier. My daughter was thrilled with her nutella crepe and samosa. I thought my chicken was excellent. Most these reviews seem to be written by Indian food experts so as someone who couldn't know less about Indian food, I thought it was absolutely delicious.",5,1/20/2022,Madras Dosa
1554,"A wandered a little farther from my office than usual last week and took out a chicken dosa from Madras Dosa. It was phenomenal - great wrap, great chicken filling, and great soup and sauces on the side...it was my first day back in the office this week and I went back for another - just as delicious! Some of the best Indian food I've had in the past couple of years.",5,3/14/2022,Madras Dosa
1555,"Really great and a unique restaurant in the Seaport. I loved my dosa. Hat tip to the dosa ""snobs"" leaving bad reviews. I am from Buffalo and get weird about wings so I hear you. But I thought this place was great. Super huge portions, lots of good filling s and good sauces. I will certainly go back. I get it we are not in Chennai, but still pretty good.",4,3/24/2022,Madras Dosa
1556,Delicious Masala Dosa and Samosa Chaat. Great sauces and very fast service. I wish there was a similar place close to Brookline.,5,4/24/2022,Madras Dosa

1558,"This place is phenomenal! Purists, please stop being so hard. This is really as good as Dosa gets in Boston! Service was great too. I just hope they keep up the good intent, and the quality! (Indian restaurants aren't particularly good at keeping up the consistency). Ghee and Podi Idli was a dream to find in main Boston and this place has made that happen, so 5 stars for that!",5,5/7/2022,Madras Dosa
1559,Amazingly delicious!!!!!!!! the food was so good and and the quantity was amazing for the price! Really enjoyed it and definitely coming back!,5,5/18/2022,Madras Dosa
1560,Great food! Very busy location when we went in the evening. Nice to have dosa and pani puri in Boston!,5,5/22/2022,Madras Dosa
1561,"We ordered Chana masala with cheese, dosa with upma, ghee idlis, and pani puri. Everything was delicious! My favorite was the idli, perfect texture and structure. The sambar is wonderful, filled with chunky vegetables and the newest Indian thing I had was their red spicy and sweet chutney.",5,5/30/2022,Madras Dosa
1562,"This was my first time here and the food was really good but I took away 1 star because they got my order wrong and I was too hungry to wait for a redo AND they were out of Mango Lassi.I would recommend their Samosa Chaat over my Dosa. The samosa chaat was delicious. It was a little different than what I usually have because it was somewhat watery and had less samosa but the flavors were exceptional.I will definitely give it another chance if I am ever in the area again. Also, I bought Lay's India's Magic Masala chips there which were delicious :)",4,6/13/2022,Madras Dosa
1563,"This place is so good!!! I've only gotten the food TO GO, but I've loved it every time. The packaging of the food is also really impressive. Keeps things nice and neat and easy to eat!!!",5,6/18/2022,Madras Dosa
1564,"Solid dosa place in Boston. When I first read reviews, it seemed like a bad idea to even make the trek out to seaport. But I saw a video on YouTube and the dosas looked decent so I gave it a try and it was nothing like those reviews from 9-10 months ago. My go to is the podi masala dosa. I would not get dosa for delivery as it is bound to get soggy. Best to eat in store.",4,6/23/2022,Madras Dosa
1565,"Overrated! They served cold food! The dosa was not crispy, extremely soggy. Never order the keema pao! It's like pao bhaji. Hardly any meat.Timing was really bad, very disorganised!",1,6/28/2022,Madras Dosa
1566,"Love this place and love the fact it's open late! We got the canteen sandwiches and they were all amazing! My favorite was the spicy potato. If you ask for extra spicy the definitely can make it spicy for you too. The chaats were also amazing! My favorite was the samosa chaat. They are so flavorful and use fresh quality ingredients, can't wait to go back and try the dosa!",5,7/15/2022,Madras Dosa
1567,"I was excited about trying this dosa place. Unfortunately, it is anything but authentic. And I know what dosa are growing up in southern India with a southern Indian mom. Its tragic to even call these dosas. There are many places around greater Boston that are orders of magnitude better.Specifics: Dosa were thick and non-crispyThe spicy potato was dry and powdery with no flavor whatsoeverSambar was basically vegetable broth with spices with no veges in it. When asked for onions they just threw in some raw cut onions in there. Bottomline : I would not recommend it and I would not go to this place again.",1,7/17/2022,Madras Dosa
1568,Amazing dosa Especially the one they recommend with ground beef and spicy potato yumm!,5,7/24/2022,Madras Dosa
1569,"Excellent! Definitely recommended if you're out in this part of Boston. (FYI there are blue bikes across the street, silver line around the corner, trader Joe's on the next block). I got the masala Dosa and it was great. The packaging for to-go orders is cool to look at, but I really wish there was less waste.. one dosa means 3 plastic containers with caps, and a giant box. :/",5,7/25/2022,Madras Dosa

1571,"Having lived in Boston for about 10 years now, this is by far the best casual Indian food place in town!  Dahi Puri and Paani Puri were cooked to perfection, very crisp and delicate for such fast casual restaurant - this will be one of my go-to menu items for sure. Spicy potatoes canteen sandwich was delicious as well, and I highly recommend for anyone to try!!",4,7/28/2022,Madras Dosa
1572,"Rude at pathetic levels. While they prepared everyone else's food, they delayed preparing ours ON PURPOSE! It was so obvious that even another customer noticed!!!Instead of making our food they went and did other things! Our order did not even require cooking! They just had to slap a few pre-made ingredients together in a bowl Chipotle style. The food was mediocre at best. Salty, soggy, and even sweet ... so enduring their pathetic attitude was not even worth it. They also did not bother update their menu. Instead, they have a half-ripped flyer that says something like ""add $1 to each item"". Will never go back and will never bring our team to this place. There are other dosa and southern Indian options not too far. Save yourself time and hassle.",1,7/31/2022,Madras Dosa
1573,"Very interesting and innovative options and the decor inside is cute. Wish there was more seating options inside, but I guess there's not that much space even outdoors so we made do. The to go containers are compostable and perfectly fit the chutneys and the dosa. The papdi chaat was tasty but definitely deviates slightly from the traditional papdi chaat flavors due to the substitution of the masala potato vs chat patta style.",4,8/9/2022,Madras Dosa
1574,"Authentic madras dosa. Interesting combinations. We ordered dosa with potatoes and chicken, dosa with potatoes and dosa with potatoes and veggies. They were all excellent.

1578,"Craving Indian food and thought I'd finally try this spot in Seaport. My partner and I ordered a dosa w paneer, ghee, and ground lamb; dosa w samosa; mango lassi; and gulab jamun -TASTE: 5/5 - everything tasted wonderful. I regret not putting more in my dosa (I assumed veggies and rice were included?), but it allowed me to sample my dosa w all of the accompanying sauces. The red sauce was sweet and tangy, the green was creamy and cool, and the orange was my favorite - savory and full! The other dosa was a great combo of flavors, however I was expecting more cardamom in the gulab jamun. Would definitely come back to load up my dosa w  masala and paneer. And try it w the sweet and fruity options too!TEXTURE: 5/5 - the dosa was crisp, the sauces added variety in texture, the gulab jamun was fried and soaked perfectly, and the mango lassi was satisfying (though wish it was colder!)PRICE: 3/5 - the dosas are expensive, considering every filling is a la carte/extra. Wasn't expecting the bill to be $50!SERVING SIZE: 3/5 - the dosas were satisfying for lunch, but the gulab jamun only came w 2 pieces unfortunately SERVICE: 4/5 - it was pretty busy for Saturday lunch. We waited in line 20min for our food. Staff was helpful!TAKEOUT: 5/5 - the dosa box is custom-made to fit your dosa and sauces!

1581,"Went here for the first time and had their masala dosa.  The aloo was pretty good and they gave a good amount.  The coconut churney was very watery with almost no taste, thier sambhar was good but they only gave about 2 table spoons of it.  They also gave a mango chutney that was tangy yet had a bit of spice - I felt a little bit went a long way. Typically  dosa is served with at least 4 oz if not a full cup of sambhar.  I wish they would have at least filled the cup that they served the sambhar in as it was barely half full.",4,9/15/2022,Madras Dosa
1582,What a fantastic find whilst walking around downtown Boston.  We really enjoyed these Indian crepes and samosas.  My wife had the wrap with spicy potatoes and cheese; I had the same but also added chicken and onions.  The sauce is awesome and we really enjoyed the lentil soup.,5,9/21/2022,Madras Dosa

1591,"Had such an amazing time at Table tonight. Jen is a true natural in the hospitality industry. I showed up 15 mins early for my 8:15 pm dinner reservation and unbeknownst to me started chatting with the owner who asked me what music I'd like to listen to. It was like being in someone's home, I actually asked if I could help with anything because it felt strange to be standing there while everyone else was bustling around. The food was sooooo good and sitting family style was really nice. My friend and I chatted with the others sitting with us and the vibe was upscale but comfortable. This isn't a fast food place, attention was paid to all the details, you can tell. We were served white bean and basil pesto dips with the focaccia. The bread was delicious, the crust was crispy but not hard and the inside was doughy, just the way it should be. We also had mushroom raviolis, homemade pasta with bolognese, octopus salad, veal, shrimp, arugula salad with walnuts, and an eggplant lasagna. To end the night was a doughnut (zeppoli) filled with nutella and raspberry sauce. Jen also brought out some homemade ricotta with a little EVOO with the focaccia.     The food was perfectly proportioned and tasty. It felt like eating at your grandma's table who's a pretty good cook. You know what I loved about this place? The food wasn't trying to be anything but delicious, just good food well prepared. Not overly seasoned, just perfect. If I wasn't so full I'd have eaten a little more but after 5 courses, I was stuffed.Brunch starts this weekend and my friend and I have already decided to come back.

The family style theme is unique and encourages you to socialize with all of the guests and even make new friends. The food came out in seven(!) courses and all were delicious - the chicken and waffles were our favorites. The food just keeps on coming and is delivered by attentive and friendly servers. And to top it all off, the chef comes out to the dining room afterwards to meet and chat with all of the guests. Such a great vibe to the place and delicious food - we're already trying to plan when we can go back for dinner.",5,3/4/2019,Table
1597,"I was invited here by friends last week as I was in the area on business.  I had reservations about going as the owner Jen is very nasty to people on social media- which I find odd given she is trying to start up a new business.  I ended up being talked into going and was sorry I did.  The food was marginal at best and with no liquor license, I was unable to drink.  The pasta bolognese ended up being cooked al dente which made it difficult to eat. The other dishes were nothing special.  With all the  great Italian restaurants in Boston, not sure what appeal to this place is. What was most disappointing was the price- extremely expensive.  I can eat at the finest restaurants in NYC for basically the same price- I can also eat without other people at my table and drink as well.  I gave this place a shot and would not return.  Buyer beware....",1,3/6/2019,Table
1598,"Went to Table with my brother who was unbelievably excited for both the food and an opportunity to meet Jen Royle. I didn't know much about the restaurant - kind of left it to surprise - and boy, am I glad I did. I was vaguely familiar with who Jen was, and learned on the way to the restaurant that it is a family style venue.Now, when I say family style, I'm not talking ""Maggiano's, sit with your throng of merry gentlemen and order off a menu the size of an elementary school chalkboard"" family style. I'm talking ""Get ready to brush elbows with strangers that you'll be friends with by the end of the night eating whatever the hell the kitchen sends you"" kind of family style. I will forewarn: if you're a control freak or have personal space and bubble issues - maybe not the best place for you. I arrived a few minuets late for the seating, but fortunately, right as Jen was announcing the menu for the evening. Her warmth emanates off of her like stench off durian - and its infectious. She engourages (borderline forces - in the best way) folks to shove down the table to be bunched together like a group of old college friends meeting at their old hangout during their 10 year reunion. You can just hear the love and excitement in her voice for the food she's prepared you, and the experience she's put together for you. The crowd we sat with was a fun-type-rowdy bunch, and Jen was able to channel all the energy of the room into the experience expertly.Our menu consisted of Gnocchi w/ short rib, gorgeous colossal shrimp scampi (scampi sauce, no pasta), meatballs in gravy, eggplant parm, giant mushroom ravioli w/ cream sauce and a touch of truffle oil, and a pork cutlet served with a delicious toasted kale and arugula salad. To finish off the meal was a perfectly sized 2 bite zeppoli (think: doughnut/friend dough) filled with Nutella and served with raspberry jam.The gnocchi were DOPE! soft and fluffy with the tiniest bit of chew right at the center. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the sauce was seasoned just right. As a meatball guy, I was super excited for them - and they didnt disappoint. The sauce was thick and rich with meat flavor, and the meatballs had amazing flavor. The texture was a touch more compact that I'd typically prefer, but in no way did this ruin the dish. Eggplant parm was great - right amount of sauce and cheese, not too wet/not too dry (and DEFINITELY NOT gloopy! runny EP is a huuuuuge pet peeve).(by now, the belly was starting to fill, but we're only halfway through! Coincidentally, there was a little bit of lag between the last and the next dishes, which in most instances would be bothersome, but in this case, all in our table group were very welcoming of the break to digest a bit.)The ravioli was really delicious with just the right amount of truffle oil to make ya feel fancy, but not so much to overpower the mushroom flavors.  The pork cutlet with kale and arugula was a great finish to the meal - heavy enough that if you needed a gutbuster youd get it, but light enough that if you were full, you could force down one more course.When the Zeppoli came out, the groans from the room were hilarious. everyone collectively sighed the same ""oh god, do we have to"" sound. I, being the fatty I am, DEFINITELY ate the whole thing. The zeppoli itself had a texture almost like a cake donut (but way more flavor), and was filled with a hearty amount of Nutella. It was served with some tart raspberry jam, which was a great contrast to the rich chocolate and light denseness of the fried pastry.The only negative is that the restaurant doesn't yet have a liquor license. To be totally honest, form my perspective, it was really awesome to sit and enjoy a genuine meal and conversation with family and some new ""friends"" without booze taking the lead, but it also very much felt like an Italian family or friend's dining room and a bottle of wine on the table would have just fit in so well. It's my understanding that Jen is working on a liquor license, which in Boston is no easy task. (Good luck with that Jen!)Overall, a solid 9-9.5 out of 10 taking into account Food, Atmosphere, Cleanliness, and Overall experience. If I weren't moving to Colorado in 3 weeks, I'd be back here often!(Also Jen - we share the same feelings about cake it seems :) )""A party without a cake is really just a meeting."" - Julia Child",5,3/8/2019,Table

I loved how Jen introduced herself, discussed what she would be serving tonight and even chatted with everyone throughout and after the meal. As someone who identifies as a 'people person' I loved the family-style arrangement. It was so nice to chat with and get to know those around us. The food was INCREDIBLE! My boyfriend is Italian, has high-expectations of Italian food and he was totally blown away. From start to finish the food was delicious, The courses just keep coming! The eggplant lasagna was the best I've ever had. Oh, and that bolognese....soooo good! And just when you think the meal can't get any better...the dessert comes!

The courses kept coming so you have to pace yourself but you get to take home as much left overs as you want so our fridge is stocked! We loved the gnocchi short rib Bolognese and the meatballs. My husband ate countless amounts of mussels. The Nutella filled zeppoli was to die for. There was a woman with a dietary restrictions and they were incredibly accommodating. You got your moneys worth for sureeeee. And Jen Royale chef and owner came out and talked with us after. She told us all about her inspiration and how the restaurant evolved. She asked us about our likes and dislikes-such an awesome business owner. We are considering reserving the spot for a large friend group to have this experience again.

People engaged in conversations and it felt like ""home"". The Zeppole was by far the best I've ever had, the Eggplant Parmesan was fantastic and those are just a few of the delicious things you will find at this gem. Jen makes you feel welcome and the staff is so kind and professional, I recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves a quaint, intimate and inviting restaurant. Bring your appetite!

You want us to socialize but we can not even have a glass of wine? You are not allowed to bring it in either. There was a plastic in my water glass which I wish I pointed out versus just taking it our, laughing and drinking my water. My stomach got upset half way through (I don't know if it was from their food or not) so we had to leave early. They didn't ask why and didn't offer to charge us less.

Table is the BEST restaurant experience in Boston for sure. Today we tried the brunch. I've always advised my kids and family to always see something twice before buying because the warts always show the second time. There are no warts at Table. The meal was exquisite and the service and fun atmosphere was just like the dinner we had a month earlier, just with 29 different people.  Jen Royle is a superstar chef (you will fall in love with her) and her restaurant is a jewel just waiting for you to discover it and fall in love with it.  So if you want to experience an Italian feast with authentic cuisine and made the old-fashioned way, try Table. You will not be disappointed.",5,4/14/2019,Table

The pasta then followed with a fettuccine alfredo, a gnocchi Bolognese, meatballs, and finally a short rib fusilli. All pasta homemade that day. What an amazing meal! I'm not a big lover of pasta and I was floored! What a great way to eat before the Boston Marathon! Wish we lived in town and could come here on a normal night.

Eight courses carefully described to you in advance by the Chef brought out at a pace that makes it almost possible to savor, share, discuss and laugh with your table while convincing yourself you can eat more. Do not fill up on the fresh baked warm bread with ricotta et al brought to you as soon as you sit down. This may be the most difficult challenge you face in your life.

She gave us fair warnings (don't fill up on the gnocchi even if it is DIVINE! There's just so much after) and encouraged us to ask questions if needed. Then she told us she'd return at the conclusion of the meal. What followed in between was nothing short of marvelous. The best meatball of my life? Yes. The most delicious homemade gnocchi in a short rib bolognese? Yes. And four other courses that made me, and all of the guests around me, swoon? Yes. A special birthday dessert in addition to the Nutella filled zeppoli? But of course. Truly, the food here is unbeatable. Run, don't walk, and get yourself a spot at this table!

1622,"Table, specifically it's concept and the kindness of the people who work there, probably saved me Friday night.I had a date that inexplicable canceled 70min before our 7pm seating time.  I was excited about this woman I had met.   I haven't dated for 19 years until recently.   On our first date, service dropped the ball.  I wanted a do over.   Since I was aware of her religious food restrictions, I went so far as to make preparations by discussing menu options with Chef Royle days in advance.  I was comforted to know that she had other options to accommodate us without making this woman uncomfortable during the meal by declining to try a dish in a family style dining environment.  When my date informed me that she had a change of heart, I was deflated. I am sick and tired of being alone and dining alone.  Loneliness is a killer.  From experience I know it can send a person into an emotional tailspin, triggering a substance abuse relapse and bring on a horrible bout of depression.  Certain feelings of despair and thoughts of self medicating began to permeate my head.   I became very concerned about what I was going to get into to cope.  I decided since I already had two reservations booked I might as well go to Table.  Why waste an opportunity to dine at a place i've been intrigued with given the unique dining experience.  I realized that I was not dining alone because you are forced to sit with others who are strangers, pass plates and engage in conversation.  Engaging in a conversation with others is what makes a meal a social event.  It enhances your experience.  I truly had fun.  We shared stories and life experiences while noshing on fantastic food. We laughed...a lot.  For over 2 hours my mind was distracted and in a happy place.  I had made the right decision.  And there is no other restaurant that I know of, that could have provided this safe haven for me.  I don't think anyone had any idea that I was hurting inside.  It was the best place in the city I could have been.  If the time spent there was spent elsewhere, at a bar by myself, it would have been more time for dark thoughts to fester, and then who knows. The staff, their service and attention to detail is spot on.  Victoria and Jada were personable, and made everyone very comfortable.  They were so damn warm, kind, and happy.  I hugged it out with Victoria when I arrived and then hugged both her and Jada at the end of the night and thanked them. I love hugs.  And I needed one upon arriving and at the end of the evening when it was time to go our separate ways.  I felt like they gave me extra attention because they were aware of what happened regarding my date.  I greatly appreciated what they did.  I was flattered by them asking me to comeback and become a regular.    I will be back.  Maybe soon, especially if my dating luck doesn't improve.  Oh and the food.  I apologize to Jen Royle for giving my opinion on her creations at the end of my review but I hope she understands why.  I consider myself a foodie so.....Hands down best meatball I recall eating. Gnocchis were Ah-mazing.  All the dishes were great.  One that stood out because I want to make it at home now was the asparagus, pancetta and shaved gruyer cheese.  Fantastic combination of flavors. I had a great experience. I look forward to getting to know the staff more upon further visits.  Maybe next time it won't be the Celebrity Chefs night off!!! No doubt she deserves it. If you are alone traveling, or just alone, don't go somewhere were everyone is on their phones. Where, if you have similar issues as me, you are more likely to turn to the dark side. Go to this establishment and love the food, the company of and conversation with complete strangers. You'll be happier and healthier if you do.  I suspect the more you go, the more it feels like Sunday dinner with your family.  Like home. I'm so truly grateful to the staff and my dinner mates.  You all played a part in helping me out last night.  I will be returning to Table sooner rather than later.  Even if it's just for a hug.",5,6/16/2019,Table

The 4 of us arrived about 10 minutes prior to 5pm. We could come in and sit and relax or go next door for a drink while they finished getting ready, so we went in and just relaxed as we already had a few drinks down the street.Around quarter past we had wine in hand and the food started rolling. And once it started, it didn't stop. Fresh bread to start. Soft inside, crunchy outside. Perfect.Popovers next...but Jen didn't like how they came out so gave us a burrata and tomato salad to snack on. Again, delicious. Fresh basil and tomatoes. So goodPopovers 2.0 came out better and were delicious. Very light and airy and warm. Next? Salad. Nice arugula salad with a light dressing. It was dressed so good. Just the right amount to give it flavor but not heavy in the least.Wine glass is empty...but the staff is so attentive and friendly that it barely hit the table before it was full again. More on this later.Now comes what I am waiting for. Meatballs, cutlets and gnocchi. All I can say is wow. Meatball was softball sized and swimming in a pool of delicious sauce. It was beyond moist. How she keeps them binded together and that moist is a work of art. Cutlets. How many cutlets have we had that are greasy and covered in sauce? Too many. Not these. Crispy and fresh. There was sauce on the side but they were so moist that it was just even needed. Then the star of the show. Gnocchi. Normally I would never order gnocchi. I find them heavy and filling and after 3 I have tapped out. These were unreal. So light and not heavy at all. I probably had 10 total and wasn't even feeling them. I ended up having 2 more as we were finishing because I couldn't stop myself. They are worth going there for alone. Throw in everything else, and this place is a gem.Finally a cannoli and some limoncello to top it all off. The ricotta in the cannoli was not heavy at all. Nice hint of lemon to it too. So good.Pro tip though: Order a coffee or cappuccino and it comes with homemade biscotti...win win!This really was the best North End meal I have had in decades and told Jen that as she came up to see how everything was. Sitting at the tables was great too. So laid back and accommodating. The staff was beyond attentive and had great personalities. You could tell they really loved working there and had fun doing so. I felt like I was at home with my family as a kid. Food was delicious, I left stuffed, it was fun and informal and really a great time.Jen has something special here not just in the atmosphere but the food is over the top delicious. Thank you again for a great experience and we will be back for dinner dinner shortly. Cannot wait.",5,11/4/2019,Table

They really ease you into the amount of food that you're served with bread and roasted peppers (so unique and amazing). The concept is not your average dinner: it is family style and you will sit with people you don't know, but even me, who likes NOBODY, enjoyed it. Also, the waitstaff was so fun and kind! The burrata was one of the best things I've ever eaten in my entire life. In fact, ever course was amazing. The meatballs, gnocchi, bread, olives...I could go on, but you get it. The highlight was Jen (owner and chef) coming up at the end of the meal. She spends time with each party - not just quick hi thanks for coming. Her passion shines through in her cooking and in the time she takes to get to know her customers. Just blown away.

1641,"We were very excited to go, but were sorely disappointed with the restaurant's execution on all fronts - quality of food, service, and experience. The menu looked delicious and the concept of family style dining sounds really fun - until one realizes that it requires a modicum of manners by all the diners at your table - and that one or two selfish diners can ruin the experience at the shared table. That happened at our table. One diner hoarded the tuna course - yes really!! What does one do in that situation except roll your eyes and shrug your shoulders? Sadly the servers don't help manage that. Also servers do not provide any description of each course as they put a platter on the table. That was a bit disappointing. They seemed more interested in pushing wine, beer, and drinks than providing any sort of meal service or explanation. Frankly their service was almost 'diner' like - but with smiles. Servers dropped a platter on the table and moved on. Worst of all - each course arrived cold/barely warm! This was inexcusable for such an expensive venue! And finally - there was no opportunity to get anything adjusted. For example, you only got very rare on the filet course. Great if that's what you like. Terrible if it isn't. Servers didn't ask patrons for feedback on any course nor seem to care about anyone's experience.",1,1/2/2020,Table

She was BEYOND friendly, warm, and welcoming which made me even more excited to try her food. When we arrived at Table, we were greeted by super friendly wait staff. We kicked things off with wine and yummy bread, oil, and olives, true to Italian form! Following this was an amazing burrata prosciutto and peppers appetizer which was so fresh and flavorful. The meatballs and homemade rigatoni were so different from what is typical of the north end. All of the courses were well timed so that we weren't rushing to finish one thing because the other came out. We also weren't waiting around for anything to come out. Dessert was delicious & the perfect way to end our meal.  Jen - you are amazing! Keep doing what you are doing.",5,1/6/2020,Table

1646,"Haven't left a review in a while... but this experience was one I wanted to share. I had heard about this place when it first opened up, and have been waiting for a special occasion to splurge & try it out because I think the concept is great. I had been talking about this place for the longest time to friends & family and I was super bummed to report back about my overall experience to everyone.  I visited here with a friend two weeks ago for a late Christmas/New Year's dinner. The decor, & set up of the tables walking in is super cute. Definitely a vibe. They left the lights really bright for dinner which was kind of meh, would set a nice ambiance if lights were dim. Not a big deal, but you also couldn't hear the music very well, it is a small space & all the reservations were chatting so it gets loud. My understanding was that you share a table with others, but the courses come out for your and your party. It was set up to groups of 6. So we a party of 2 were seated with a party of 4. So the food that came out was portioned for 6 guests.The servers were polite, when we got there, we were checked in for our reservation. I would like to point out, that I didn't have open table until I had to make a reservation for the specific restaurant so I downloaded it. Apparently there is a reward system and you get points for going to restaurants that you make reservations for, I will circle back to this point later .We ordered 2 glasses of wine, & my friend then ordered a $55 bottle of wine. When we got to the table there was bread and garlic and olives, it was actually really tasty for me it was actually the tastiest thing of the entire night. There was nine courses I believe, and I have to say that everything that came out for my personal palate was bland, basic & underwhelming small portions for the $90 per person. The menu was a mixture of so many different things, There was a certain point where I kind of wanted it to be over but I was looking forward to the salad, and when the salad came out it was literally arugula doused in oil with some sunflower seeds. No flavor whatsoever. Again I was so looking forward to trying this place out so I don't know if my expectations were really high.I personally didn't eat a lot of the things that came out & pretty much a lot of it was still on my plate at the end of the night when it was cleared. Which is a cue in most restaurants for servers to at least ask if everything tasted ok. The bill came and we just dished out almost $300 for a meal that I was walking away hungry from. I went on the review outlets and noticed that the majority of the reviews are five stars which is great if other guests have had five star experiences when visiting. I noticed those who had lesser experiences expressed the same / similar experiences as we did. I actually work in reputation management for restaurants, and I was reading the emotional responses that the owner had to those who did not think that her restaurant offers a five-star experience. I decided not to leave a review at the time, but my friend decided to leave one on Google. Again I'm in repetition management for restaurants, so I have seen & responded to all sorts of reviews on behalf of restaurants. The owner responded back taking the review personally, And decided to go to open table to cancel my reservation so that I would lose the points that I had rightfully earned for committing to the reservation, showing up and paying $300 for a meal with gratuity. This reaction disappointed me even more & is why I am leaving this review. My friend left that review not me, and the unprofessional emotional reaction was mind boggling to me. i get as small business owners their passion is their purpose, but first and foremost entrepreneurs are running a BUSINESS. Feedback positive or negative is going to happen, it shouldn't be taken personal, but from a reputation management perspective should certainly be handled with tact. The establishment had no problem taking my $, but decided to take away the points as what? Retribution? Retaliation? To be honest it's not about the money, its about how your guests feel when they leave, &  its about providing VALUE for the price you are charging. The $ invested did not give me any value. I walked out hungry. I will never go back. Try it if you want, but foodie beware.",1,1/18/2020,Table

My boyfriend and I decided to support local business and enjoy Italian comfort food after some very uncomfortable days, and order delivery from Table via chownow (something they're recommending via their Instagram account, and something I've been following eagerly, waiting to try). I'll just shoot it to you straight - I have never in my life been spoken to the way the owner spoke to me on the phone after calling about an order that THEY messed up. After swearing several times, saying ""ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU'RE CALLING ABOUT TWO FUCKING MEATBALLS!?"" I didn't even get a chance to let her know that this meal is a splurge for us at upwards of $65. That said - yes, I ordered the rigatoni with meatballs, yes, chownow says the Marsala comes with penne - so why in God's name are you screaming at me when I'm simply inquiring to get what we paid for?Before people read through this, I'll have you know I NEVER raised my voice to this woman, mostly because I didn't have a chance to get a word in. Never mind the eggshell in our dish, I wasn't even going to mention that, because quite frankly shit happens (meatballs go missing, eggshells sometimes fall into the food, Jen), but how you handle it is a whole other story. So just a quick thank you for making an extremely shitty week, that much worse for two hardworking people who have been waiting to try your restaurant. As a couple with a vast, foodie network, not only do I hope you give us that refund tomorrow, but I also hope you can extend a heartfelt apology, because you've absolutely ruined our evening - not with missing meatballs, but with how you think you speak to another human being.",1,3/20/2020,Table

We sat with the NICEST people and when you're sharing incredible food, suddenly you all have something in common :)We started with the bread basket, which is house made, and holy crap- the roasted garlic dip is something I still think about. The other choices were cannellini dip and olive tapenade. all were delicious. We also got shishito peppers, which I would also not choose for myself but I was add-ic-ted. I love the Russian roulette of sweet and spicy. Control yourself, don't fill up on the peppers. pasta is coming.Gnocchi Bolognese, you make my dreams come true. I could have stopped here and been 1000% satisfied. Whatever the chef makes this with is TRUE magic. Next up was Mussels Italiano. Plump, delicious mussels with delicious tomatoes. Something ""light"" to give you a break after the hearty gnocchi. After the mussels, beautiful meatballs hit the table with cheese and basil and ricotta on top, holy moly. Moist, HUGE meatballs that I had obviously too much of, 4 courses in. I'm screwed.Roasted Asparagus was next. Asparagus is, again something I usually don't choose for myself, but veggies were needed at this point. The asparagus came with pancetta and shaved gruyere. YUM. Next up came what I came for, the eggplant parm. This is love. this is homemade, tastes amazing as hell, and if you thought you've had great eggplant parm, you're wrong. you haven't. that's all.  *shrug*Next was sweet greens. came with bibb lettuce, gorgonzola, walnuts and figs. Admittedly, I was SO freaking full I just picked at the figs and lettuce, and before I knew it, I'm going back for more, what am I doing? save room for dessert! The grand finale: housemade zeppolis filled with hazelnut spread, over incredible raspberry sauce.  *bites fist*  perfect little pillows of dough, tricking you into having one, because you have JUST enough room for dessert, and then because they're so amazing, you grab another. So I hate myself for eating all this food, and I'm so sad that its over all at the same time. Chef Jen comes up from the kitchen to introduce herself and we give her a rousing round of applause.

I had been wanting to go for a long time but I wasn't too sure I was going to like the Lemon Chicken on the Mother's Day menu since I'm not usually a fan of Chicken Picatta.   Wow!!! Was I amazed. Everything was so delicious, especially the lemon chicken. The ingredients were simple and fresh. The rosemary bread was worth every bite. The prosciutto wrapped burratta with pistachio pesto was mind blowing! The chicken was lightly breaded and the sauce was not over powered by lemon. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert, so I was excited for that. But the raspberry sauce was the perfect accent. I'm craving that raspberry sauce now. Great pairing, Jen! To top it all off, we splurged and got the espresso martini mix. We got 4 servings out of the jar. Perfect ending to an amazing Mother's Day dinner.     When I went in to pick up the order, I was warmly greeted by Jen's wonderful mom! She was sweet, referred to me by name and wished me a happy Mother's Day.       In all honesty, during uncertain times where holiday celebrations are far from traditional, the team at Table made my Mother's Day memorable.

It's just fresh homemade food and the price is perfect I paid less than 60 bucks feed a family of 3 and had some left over for the next day. My wife had half her eggplant and I had half the chicken Parm because it was huge. The only bad part my daughter eat all the ziti !!! Well worth the money",5,7/20/2020,Table

My husband and I are both nurses and with everything going on we haven't been out much, but tonight we happened to get a night off together. We haven't been to the North End since places have reopened, they have patio seating now out on Hanover street and it was the perfect night to dine al fresco. Everything from the first course of bruschetta to the meatballs, to the chicken and gnocchi, all the way to dessert was absolutely phenomenal. The drinks are delicious too. The red sangria is amazing! Table has definitely made it to our top restaurant list and is our new favorite restaurant in the North End. I can't wait to bring my friends and family next time! Thank you again for the most delicious meal!",5,8/7/2020,Table

Take out from this place wasn't great, but given everything thats happened, I figured the kitchen was probably stressed trying to overcome many changes & challenges. So, I'd give it a shot live. Overpriced compared to other restaurants in the N. End. It was just average. For the money, I can have a better dining experience elsewhere. Staff were friendly, but they seemed edgy & nervous? It was odd.",2,8/12/2020,Table

Oh those meatballs. By far, best we've ever had.  Not to take away from Jen's gnocchi, cannoli, and sauce. Can't wait to come back with friends post-covid!",5,8/23/2020,Table

Hubby had dined here pre-pandemic, and we've enjoyed takeout over the last few months but it was time to venture out. We had reserved an outdoor table, but there was a chance of rain so we were offered our choice of indoor or outdoor seating on arrival. Not quite ready for indoors yet so we had a lovely seat on (well, in) Hanover Street. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, and spent just the right amount of time with us explaining how the set menu worked. Everything was delicious, from the warm, fresh bread with roasted garlic to the zeppoli with chocolate-hazelnut spread and raspberry coulis. We even enjoyed the octopus (a little outside our Irish-American, meat and potatoes comfort zone). The meatballs are a must. An 8-course meal can be a little daunting but serving sizes were perfect and we enjoyed from beginning to end, including a visit, not from the chef-owner, but her mom - who apologized for the slow service (NOT an issue) and made us feel right at home. We will definitely return - and often - and look forward to the soon-to-open Table Boston Mercato next door.",5,8/30/2020,Table

We were understanding when a waitress told me I couldn't be at the table (of my party) next to me because of covid violations ..totally understand... cant light your candles on your cake.. covid violations, still ok... yet when we called two hours earlier to tell the owner we would not be able to have 4 people come because they worked at Gillette Stadium with Cam Newton (he tested postive that morning) ..we were told "" I don't care if they work for the white house you still have to pay for them"" If it weren't for Covid and it being a 30th birthday with people visiting from out of town we would have  gone somewhere else. Instead we paid 400 for 4 people who weren't there for the safety of my pregnant friends and her wait staff. As a social worker in Brockton, humanity and kindness are very important to me.

I was so confused. I told her that I had cancelled the reservation the same day I made it, I also hadn't ordered anything ahead of time. She demanded the name of the person who I talked to when I called to cancel - I told her I couldn't remember as it was a couple of weeks ago. I never raised my voice to this woman and was just kind of shocked by how I was treated on the phone - this person didn't care how she was talking to me.Glad we cancelled - this treatment was just embarrassing.",1,10/15/2020,Table

We did the Sunday dinner at 7:30 pm and sat outside (very covid friendly with spaced apart tables & on the more quiet side of Hanover). Very cool concept of a family style 8 course meal with a set menu (focaccia bread, burrata, arugala salad, cutlets, meatballs, gnocchi, Cannoli, limoncello). All of it was DELISH and we ended up taking home leftovers. Cutlets were so crispy and sauce was amazing. Everything was fresh and tasted like it was made with love. The gnocchi was light, stuffed with cheese & melted in your mouth. Cannolis were also amazing. Service was great, we had two waitresses helping us out, both of which were extremely helpful and friendly.

1686,"Table is an absolute must try for anyone and everyone who enjoys fabulous food! Every last detail had been so carefully thought out and curated to perfection. The Sunday supper highlights every dish you would want to try from classic Italian cooking. Courses are brought out at a comfortable pace, and the fact that you sit down and the meal choices have been decided - leaves time to relax and enjoy conversation with your party and sometimes with other parties dining as well! The staff make you feel like you are joining dinner at the family home- friendly, welcoming and thoughtful. I have made Table a regular stop on my dining out routine, and have successfully tried all items on the menu! (Reservations will get you the coursed sit down menu and if you are able to snag a table without a reservation you can order a la carte!) I can say with confidence that this is the best Italian food I have ever had! I am so excited to start shopping at the mercato when it opens and will be sure to stock up on items...especially with the holidays right around the corner- they are sure to have some great gifts! Definitely check out Table if you can get to the North End! It's worth every last bite!",5,10/23/2020,Table

We were stuffed last night, and have enough for another full dinner tonight.  I highly recommend ordering from here!",5,11/16/2020,Table

1690,By far one of the best places I have ate at. The aspect of a family style meal is truly welcoming and the multiple course meals will leave you actually wanting more even after entering into a food coma. I would say Table is more of an event or special occasion location but Jen did open Table Mercato next door which is also to die for. From the coffee to caprese sandwich to meals to go. Table is more on the pricy side but that speaks volumes to the service and food! Table Mercato is affordable ! A coffee is about $4.50 and soooo yummy. If you haven't been to either of these locations put it on your to do list. Table Mercato and Table have exceeded all expectations,5,12/31/2020,Table

The minute you walk through the door you feel at home in this restaurant, I felt like I was in my Nonna's kitchen! This family style restaurant in the North End has amazing food, great conversation and a wonderful owner! This nine course dinner was one of the best meals I have ever had.

I want to say there were ten courses so you will want to go starving and make sure to not fill up on the first few courses like I did. The octopus was the best I've ever had. The burrata and meatballs were huge and delicious, the pasta with sausage and mushrooms was to die for, and the doughnuty type dessert was also so good! The chef even sent us tiramisu and limoncello shots which was so nice of her! It's nice because they give you to go containers and you can bring whatever you don't eat home with you. The ambiance was dark and great for a date night or friends night out.. actually now that I think about it I want to rent the place out for a small party. It would be perfect for that! I loved it so much that I actually went a couple days later to check out the Mercado. I ordered the Italian and caprese.

I'm still a huge fan of the beef/pork/veal meatballs with ricotta and the artichoke dish, plus I forgot how huge the pieces of octopus are! I also have to note that on both this night and our previous dinner back in December, the donuts were sweeter and much more to my liking than the first visit from my original review. Can't explain what happened that time, but Jen is definitely 7-for-7 on this menu! By the way, she stopped by several times during our meal and could not have been more friendly, engaging, and funny. I'm really glad she toughed it out through COVID and now has not only a fabulous menu to offer Bostonians but one of the more elegant and relaxed patios in the North End.Bonus Tony's Tip:  TABLE serves a different ""Sunday Supper"" menu on Sundays (really more like late lunch and early dinner seatings). It looks just as good. We have yet to go...but I'm moving this up toward the top of the list!",5,6/13/2021,Table

My only two recommendations are, the menu was a bit heavy; meatballs & short rib bolognese are just too heavy to have together. But I'm also not complaining about my left overs I'm eating today! Also during covid no one likes to sit super close to the person next to them - before covid the idea of a family table was fantastic!

The food we could eat was delicious, however, and the family style way of serving made it easier to accommodate people in our group that didn't eat certain things. While the interior is cozy with a charming vibe it got a bit loud. It was also warm evening and it was warm in the restaurant.

Also, the whole night they don't change your plate and silverware unless you ask for it. So, the whole experience was like eating cafeteria food in a restaurant setting, only that some cafeteria food is much better and cheaper.

I came because I heard Leo Dicaprio came here to get food while filming for a movie in Boston (because Leo wouldn't lead me astray) and I can confirm the dinner was as Oscar-worthy as the actor himself (although the restaurant actually gets the credit it deserves).

The meatballs were also delicious and a sizable portion. The octopus course probably could have used a touch more octopus and a touch less polenta, but the octopus was cooked well. Photos of each course are attached. Overall the pre fixe had enough food for sure per person and it was coursed well in terms of timing. They also provided complimentary champagne for our anniversary which was a really sweet touch.My one issue was despite it being part of the experience, sitting literally adjacent to people you don't know was a little concerning given vaccine cards weren't being really checked and a few people especially right next to me were coughing.

The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, from drinks to each course. You are sitting at large tables with other parties, so if that isn't your style that's something to note.  Back to the food: the roasted garlic and focaccia was a great start, and it only got better from there. Six additional courses followed (including chicken, huge meatballs, gnocchi, and cannolis) and not one thing we had was close to mediocre. This restaurant knows it's food and excels in customer service, and is a must try if you like great food and atmosphere!",5,2/20/2022,Table
1730,"Great service, the food was your typical Italian fare.  We had the prefix 7 course meal.  Basic Roasted garlic, with extra salty focaccia bread.  The gnocchi seemed more like pasta texture then the pillowy potato gnocchi that I'm used to.  They gave us two salads a Waldorf spinach and prosciutto caprese but the Waldorf did not seem to fit into this Italian mix.Fresh peas were a nice touch with the lobster pasta but the white sauce might have been nice to have more flavor-- garlic or Parmesan cheese?  Short ribs with polenta were pretty good and tender. Nutella bread pudding was my favorite out of the crop, but the white sauce with it was plain (maybe put some white chocolate in it?). They give you one free Prosecco but It would have been nice to have some wine tastings for the price charged on NYE.",4,3/1/2022,Table

Jen Royle, the owner, looked at her coworker, looked at me, looked back at the coworker, and said, ""It's $30."" I was surprised, because I'd been there the other day to pick up a box of pasta and paid $6 with card. I asked her if this was a new policy, and she laughed at me and said, ""no. Since the day we opened."" I wasn't in the mood to order from someone creating a new rule on the spot in such a condescending way, so I left. I know this is an unimaginable time for small businesses and restaurants. I always looked up to Jen as a role model for women in Boston, but I was really hoping a restaurant and owner with such a strong reputation would treat someone from their neighborhood with a little more respect. By the way, I (literally) have receipts.",1,3/11/2022,Table
1732,"TLDR: Homey Italian cooking in an intimate space. It is certainly delicious food and a nice experience, but you can find a comparable meal for cheaper elsewhere in the North End. Also, it is a LOT of food so make sure you are hungry!****My partner and I decided to make a Friday date night reservation at Table after having wanted to go for awhile. We went for the earlier seating (6-8PM).* Check-in experience (3/5): The initial check-in process was a bit hectic: guests for the 6PM seating were arriving all at once, there was no dedicated front of house team, and the servers were bustling to get everything in order. Granted, the dining area is a relatively small space and there are two pre-scheduled seatings per night, so it wasn't too complicated of a process. But there could be some fine tuning to help get people's evenings off to a calmer/smoother start.* Decor (4/5): An intimate and rustic space with beautiful exposed brick walls and a lovely wine display. The long wooden tables and family-style seating really do make you feel like you're sitting at a ""family table."" * Vibe (4/5): We enjoyed the lite background music (great throwback tunes!), which fit the overall ambiance well. The only slight downside was that there was a loud / large party during our seating. We were at the furthest point from them and it still felt like we were part of their conversation...so could certainly imagine that putting a damper on the evening if you're looking for more of a quiet date night. Obviously, this isn't something Table can control -- but something to be aware of in terms of the limitations of the small space and family-style seating.* Service (5/5): All of our servers were personable, professional, and attentive.* Food (4/5): There was a set dinner menu of seven courses. Note that the restaurant does not do substitutions or accommodate for any dietary restrictions:1. Focaccia with roasted garlic: One of my partner's favorite dishes of the evening -- warm, homemade focaccia bread with rosemary and whole roasted garlic. A delicious way to start the meal (though you can get dangerously full just from bread if you're not careful!) 2. Burrata and prosciutto: I love burrata dishes and this dish certainly did not disappoint -- a rich stracciatella with ripe cherry tomatoes surrounded by a pistachio crumble. For the two of us, we each got a whole round of burrata, which I happily ate with some of the remaining focaccia 3. Spinach and pear salad: Next was a spinach salad with pear, baked pancetta, almonds, and a goat cheese mousse. It wasn't anything mind-blowing/special, but I love a good salad and it was a nice reprieve between some of the richer dishes 4. Seared octopus with Parmesan polenta: The octopus was delightful -- well cooked and flavorful. The polenta and potatoes weren't our favorite but more due to personal preference than how they were cooked- Fruit sorbet: A delightful palette cleanser before the meat-based / main dishes of the evening. My partner and I think it was a blackberry flavor -- it was creamy but light and reminded me a bit of the GoGurts that we used to enjoy as children!5. Meatballs (beef, pork, and veal) with house made ricotta: At this point, I was already so stuffed but forged on and had half a meatball with a large basil leaf, tomato sauce, and housemade ricotta cheese. As someone who is not a huge fan of meatballs, it was fine -- in retrospect, my partner and I probably could have split one meatball and then asked for a box to take the other one home to enjoy later6. Short rib ravioli: This was one of my favorite dishes of the night -- my only regret was how full I was by this point (which made eating a little painful). The red wine tomato reduction was INCREDIBLE and paired with the short rib, it was truly *chef's kiss*7. Nutella espresso bread pudding: You know the dessert is good when you can't stop inhaling it despite being so full it hurts to eat...Hands down our favorite dish -- a perfect balance between being homey/warm/comforting and elevated dessert fare. Great texture, great taste, and plenty of chocolate chips. Plus, just a classic pairing of vanilla bean ice cream. YUM!* Drink (4/5): My partner ordered a Negroni at the start of dinner. He said it was great flavor and large/generous serving that lasted him much of the meal. Nothing fancy/special, but we weren't expecting / looking for that.* Cost/value (3/5): The meal (with 1 cocktail plus tax and tip) came out to ~$270 for two. It's certainly on the pricier end for a meal and there are a lot of restaurants around Boston where you can get a pretty nice meal for that price. In the future, my partner and I might opt to go to another restaurant in the North End for similar quality food for a lower total cost -- especially since this was just a normal date night / not celebrating a special occasion.",4,3/13/2022,Table

We even reminded our server before the first course that our party of three, vegetarians. We were served 5 of 6 courses with meat and asked to ""pick the meat off"" or ""eat around it"". When we politely complained we were brought salad and plain pasta, not worth $98 per person.

The service was excellent, and the food was amazing. My personal favorites from this evening's menu were the meatballs and the chicken cutlet and arugula salad but all of the food was fantastic.  Of course, the highlight of the evening was when Jen Royle came out to check on us and shared a few hilarious stories.An all around fantastic evening, and I am looking forward to going back soon.",5,5/22/2022,Table
1737,Lovely restaurant in North End that offers a communal family style seating.  Everyone sits on one table so if you prefer a private table this isn't for you.  It's a fixed menu for a fixed price. My mistake was that I didn't check the menu beforehand and most of the dishes had pork I can tell you that whatever didn't have pork was delicious. The bread & garlic was a great starter. I enjoyed the salad & burrata but the short rib ravioli was my absolute favorite!!  The octopus was another good dish. & the orange sorbet was a delightful palate cleanser For dessert we enjoyed a bread pudding served with ice cream & left happy & full,4,5/23/2022,Table

1739,"Dined here with my partner last weekend. In our opinion it was very average, but for the quality of food you would expect to receive for Table's price point, it was below average. Focaccia was weak, which was immediately a bad sign. Not sure if it was just a bad batch, but it didn't have the crisp crust that focaccia normally has and it tasted over-salted. The roast garlic was good, but that's just the nature of garlic. Burrata was not creamy and flavorful, which I think is a sourcing issue - Mamma Maria in the North End has great burrata they say they get from a local vendor, for example. The octopus was under-seasoned and seemed to be doused in tomato purée. Sorbet was great. Fried artichokes were very underwhelming - quite limp and didn't have the crispness you'd expect. The aioli seemed more like a mayo - I normally eat aioli with a thicker texture, where as this had more the texture of mayo from a jar. In our opinion it tasted like something you'd put on a BLT. Meatballs were the one excellent thing on the menu. Pasta was under seasoned and the meat had a very unappealing texture. Strawberry shortcake was ok, but I think most of us could follow a recipe and make a better one at home. If a restaurant touts olive oil cake on their menu, I expect it to be simple and delectable. It wasn't. I would have given two stars, but given the very expensive price point and the interior decor that looks like the sale section of HomeGoods, I give it a one. If you want good food and a fancy dining experience in the North End, go to Mamma Maria. If you want exceptional food, go to Oleana or Sarma.

1746,"It was a sad day when Zon's closed.  Hyde Square really needed a casual restaurant with hearty food to give the neighborhood some much-needed warmth.  With a rent-sharking landlord owning that entire corner on the rotary, there was news of yet-another-Indian-restaurant moving into the space.  Like JP really needs another freaking Indian restaurant.  Sheesh.So it was happy news that The Haven was opening up, and keeping quality comfort food alive.  We went there yesterday with tempered excitement, but after trying some of the dishes, it was apparent that this wasn't just another pub serving unexciting but filling food.The haggis and neeps were a great warm-up, savory and nuanced with spices, and plenty for an entree for one, really.The fish supper was probably the best fried fish I've had in Boston, with a rich, substantial batter, succulent firm fish, and great housemade spiced ketchup.  The fries weren't particularly special, but a little crisper and they would be.The burger was cooked to a perfect medium as requested, with a sturdy bun to rein in the mayonnaise-y sauce and other moist things.  I'd love to try it medium-rare or rare sometime to see how much better it could be.The top prize definitely went to my beef and ale pie, however, with big chunks of tender beef and well mingled ale-stewed onions under a flaky crust topped with my beloved caraway seeds.  It didn't really look like anything special, but each bite was one of those eyes-closed, humming deals where you try to delay swallowing as long as possible.We skipped dessert this time (Surgeon General's warning), but the raspberry Drambuie tart sounded pretty freaking delicious.  Dammit, now I want a rusty nail...The only weak spot in my book was the draft beer selection, which leaned heavily on Harpoon, the industrial-scale homebrew-tasting stepchild of the New England beer options.  Switch the taps to Smuttynose or BBC, and do the food justice.  The bottle options were superior, but this food screams out for a pint!",5,6/21/2010,The Haven

I got the house chardonnay ($9) and got a tumbler glass of warm wine - not what you're looking for on a hot night.  I also noticed the beers were not served cold, but not all beers are supposed to be so i guess I can't comment.  On the plus side, the Haven has a good feel.

Since we were in a very sharing mood, we also tried the beef and ale pie which was pretty large and was so tasty...and the burger, which came with onion marmalade and other sauces, a wee bit over-done but still nice.  It was one of those hot hot nights and although I was a little full, I was having a laugh, I didn't want to go home quite yet so we ordered dessert.  The raspberry drambuie pie was really good and very ""drambuie-ish"" nothing like scotch in your dessert!!

1756,"After a love affair with Zon's, I had mixed feelings about walking into the Haven. Needless to say, the place definitely fixed the ""mixed"" part of those feelings. Now, I'll just have to reminisce about Zon's and what the Hyde Square corner used to be with the Milky Way and the June Bug in full swing....About the Haven. Decor is a decent start on a theme but somewhere between the newly expanded bar space and the elementary school chairs, the place feels half-vacant instead of homey. The antlers are great if that's your thing.The food reminded me of why so few places attempt to make a menu straight out of the British Isles. I had the fish and chips - both waaay over-fried. I wound up digging the fish out of the breading core so that I was able to eat my dinner without losing a tooth. The minted, smashed peas were good, but there was only about 1/8 of a cup of them on my plate...didn't do much to break up the monotony of the rest of the unseasoned dish. $14 for a totally uncreative let down.My dining partner had the beef and ale pie, which was edible, but again mostly unseasoned. He recalls reading on the menu that ""vegetables"" were part of the dish, but only had meat and potatoes in the bowl that he got. $17 I think.Oh, we did have a fantastic salad as an appetizer, but it was only big enough for each of us to have about 4 bites and cost $8. We were one of four filled tables at that point and it still took us 10 minutes to get our beers. Refills weren't an option.Now, some folks might say ""They just opened, give it some time"" but I say that 8 weeks was long enough to wait before expecting my fish to come out of the fryer before it fossilizes.Sorry, Hyde Square, you lose on this one.",2,8/4/2010,The Haven

Ok I stole her black pudding and oat cakes with my ""Hey is that Billy Connolly?"" routine. The lass falls for it every time. I can't believe it but it was the first time either of us have had oat cakes (both coming from Scots parents), something so basic can be so tasty, must be the fresh ingredients.After downing a pot of coffee or so we headed down Centre Street for a walk around Arnold Arboretum, then after working off breakfast there we returned for ""a pint"", we ended up killing the afternoon at the bar with a Belhaven or two, the lass enjoyed the Harpoon Cider, and I sampled a mixture of the Cider & their Belgium Ale - not bad on a hot & humid Sunday afternoon in Boston. Great banter with the barkeep and the growing number of regulars.Folks should know they now accept credit cards.I'm basing my five stars on sincerely feeling like we had returned to the B & B we stayed at in Fife a couple years back (though a lot cheaper).",5,8/9/2010,The Haven
1758,"This has become a regular hangout for my husband and I. This place has a low key atmosphere, great Scottish food, and a friendly knowledgeable staff. We've been to The Haven almost every week since it opened and usually sit at the bar and order beer and our dinner. The Haven Burger is delicious, and a menu staple. Other parts of the menu change seasonally. The beer also changes from time to time depending on what's available and seasonal. Always on tap is Belhaven, a Scottish brew.The Haven is also a place that draws ex-pats and neighborhood people, making for a great crowd. We always seem to meet great people there and strike up a conversation. And Jason, the barkeep, is amazing!Try the bread pudding too!",5,8/11/2010,The Haven
1759,"We came here for a Wednesday night dinner and it was surprisingly pretty crowded. We were earlier enough to get a table easily.The atmosphere is nice and interesting. The chairs are blue desk chairs from a high school classroom.... which was different. I was on a bench so I can't speak to the comfort of the chairs.They give you oatcakes and butter and pickled grapes, onions and pickles as snacks. They were all good.We ordered:Haggis and Neeps (as my entree.. but had the appetizer size) - delicious! It's enough food if you order a side to supplement.2 Meat Pies - these are large and have a wonderful caraway seed crust.Side of mushy mint peas - I liked these a lot. Others thought they were too ""minty""Side of chips - yummy - thick and crunchy!1 cider, 2 Belhaven Scottish Ales - also great!Deep fried milky way candy bar - candy bar was good but it the battered outside wasn't anything too great. The Drambuie whip cream was awesome.Total Cost = $75 before tip (for 3 people)Consensus: We all liked our food. I wish we would have tried a different dessert. The candy bar was a novelty but I wouldn't get it again. Prices were a little steep for the entrees. I would go back for drinks/bar menu to try some of their ""Late Night"" food.",4,8/12/2010,The Haven
1760,"I went to Haven with two friends on a Tuesday night. The place was nearly full, but the waitress quickly rearranged tables to find us seats. We had the fried haddock fish dinner, the beef pie, and chicken tikka masala. All were delicious, with special praise for the chicken tikka. A complementary serving of flat oatcakes with butter was provided as a snack. I thought the first bite was bland and a bit dry, by the second I started to appreciate the flavor, and on the third I decided that I liked it very much and was eating the crumbs. Ambience was pleasant, the service was fast and friendly.I'm looking forward to returning.",4,8/18/2010,The Haven
1761,"Loved this place! I wanted to lick my plate and my date's plate.  He had the fish & chips and I had the beef and ale pie.  Both were savory and perfect.  They also treated us to free oatcakes (sounds bad, but were VERY tasty) and some pickled things that were also delish.  Alas, I hate myself for not saving room for dessert.The waitstaff was awesome- everyone from the host to the bartender to the waitress.  I could definitely see myself returning many times.",5,8/18/2010,The Haven
1762,"This place has an awesome set up. Great lighting, comfortable seating and an enthusiastic bartender. All of the food I have tried tastes great. On a side note don't expect to have a hot waitress, the waitresses are borderline 'hipsters'. We all know what a hipster is by now girl with revealing tatoo's, funny glasses, unfortunate dyed hair. Besides that everything here is good",5,8/20/2010,The Haven
1763,"A gathering spot that evokes the feeling left behind in the UK years ago.  Meeting up here  for dinner and sips with friends I either met in the UK (or Ireland) or lived with. The Haven brought back many great memories while nibbling a classic fish and chips complete with mushy peas.The space is split into essentially two rooms open to each other.  Mixed decor including; photos of Scottish wildlife, old school cafe chairs, lots of wood and Celtic supporting materials pasted to the bathroom wall serving as wallpaper.There is a fireplace that will most certainly enhance the mood in the cold weather ONLY it's awkwardly placed between the two rooms and not a focal point of the space in the current set up.Jayson (remember him behind Matt Murphy pub) remembers everyone and always keeps a killer soundtrack going.  I noticed mostly Scottish based music too!  (think Camera Obscura and Belle and Sebastian)On tap is a GREAT selection of beers/ales/lagers etc.  including many Scottish specialties.  Bummer that there is no alcohol...how will this place survive without being able to serve Scotch?  I'm sure it'll do fine regardless!My dining partners had the scotch egg...sausage and mash.  They though it was the best they'd ever had.Saturday in the summer was pretty quiet.  Infant friendly early on.  Saw a mix of young JP hipsters AND elderly folks out for a traditional taste of Scottish cuisine.Service was friendly but not EXACT...what you might expect for a pub.No parking but it's easy to circle for on street which is meter-less and 2 hour limited depending on time of day you visit.I see good things for this place.  A sofa or other more plush seating area perhaps focused around the fireplace will make a fabulous winter addition to the Haven.",4,8/22/2010,The Haven
1764,"Great meal, great bar! The first truly authentic pub we have found in Boston. Maybe it's because the music wasn't blaring and there wasn't a plethora of flat screen televisions - but when we stepped in it felt like being back at home in an (albeit really nice, non-grimy, non-dive-bar) local pub.I think what I really like about it is that it is not like a ""theme pub"" like so many of the ""Irish"" bars are here. Even if there are Irish staff in the bars, they have this American vibe to them - as I said, not so here.The food was really tasty - I had fish and chips, and the batter was great - like batter found in a GOOD pub or chippie - so maybe not 'typical'!! It wasn't either the 'breaded' batter or tempura batter that you often find here. It was nice and thick and crisp, with that slightly moist white bit where it meets the fish.Husband had steak pie, and again, he thought it was really good. We split the shortbread for desert. Didn't want to buy into the myth that deep fried mars bars were what Scots eat for desert! Probably will succumb at some point though.The menu seemed great and will def be back to try more things. It is basically good pub grub that you would find in Scotland. I would hope that the chef will change it periodically though, because I can foresee coming back quite regularly.Very friendly staff was great to speak with someone from home. Will def be back!",5,8/25/2010,The Haven
1765,"My friend introduced to me to The Haven on a brunch outing and the experience was casual and good.  The owner is warm and welcoming and his staff follows right along.  He had his son visit our table and ask how everything was and thank us for coming.  Nice touch.  Aside from liking the casual ambiance and overall experience, the food was fresh and haggis turned out not to be bad after all.",3,9/2/2010,The Haven
1766,"This place is awesome! The food was out of this world. I went for a relaxed Sunday brunch and that is exactly what I got. I didn't feel rushed by crazy lines or other customers hovering and waiting for tables. I had the bubble and squeak - a wonderful vegetarian option. The service is a relaxed European style, so if you are in a hurry you may need to ask for the check and not just mill around drinking tons of tea. I will definitely be checking this place out for dinner.",5,9/6/2010,The Haven
1767,"I went last month with some friends and had haggis for the first time. I also had the fish supper (fish and chips) with mushy mint pea. The fish was great, not over fried and the batter was very nice. The chips were excellent. Nice and thick and not overcooked. I had a few pints of Belhaven that really hit the spot. Oh and oat cakes with butter and pickled veggies were brought to our table with the menus and were gI'll be stopping in tonight to try the Haven Burger and expect I won't be disappointed! Great food, atmosphere, and brews! Extremely friendly owner and staff.Belhaven on draguht is quite the treat! And please, the people that are taking points off for the foodChips are NOT fries, they are supposed to be a bit raw on the inside and are supposed to be THICK. It's how it's done in the UK.If the food is not to your liking and you don't think it's on par with other Scottish food you've had that's fine but you need to understand this is authentic Scottish cuisine. You wouldn't go to Indian restaurant and fault the place if you dont even like Indian food in the first place would you?",5,9/13/2010,The Haven
1768,"""This is British comfort food"" as she pointed at the broiled cow testicles on her plate. At least that is how I describe what actually was the ""Haggis and neeps"" my Scottish friend ordered. She said Americans feel better when you simply tell them that Haggis isn't a far cry from sausage... but I tasted nothing sausagey about it. I think my palate detected liver..... but since she loved it, I'll have to take her word that it is the real McCoy. Authentic British food.... and a dish I'll never try again.But, I did enjoy the coronation chicken sandwich (curried chicken), which I haven't had in a quite a few years, and is something I do know a bit about. They could have put in a few more raisins into the mix, but it was still good. Loved the chips (British for 'fries') that came with it, and was a decent meal.What I really like about The Haven is that it has a really nice feel about it. An easy-going crowd, where everyone seemed to just fit. Everyone seemed to be respectful, and more importantly, comfortable. I fed right off this aura and very quickly assimilated into cruise control, enjoying my lime cordial. I was tempted to try the deep-fried Mars bar, but I'm in the middle of dropping pound #15 as part of my 30-day-drop-20-pound goal.... which means no sugar for anything after breakfast.I'll definately come again.",4,9/18/2010,The Haven
1769,"Was back  for my 2nd trip to The Haven last week. The first trip was spontaneous; the hubby was taking his Scottish-American friend out for a bday meal.  I popped in to wish him well just as they were being served their haggis and sausage, so I got a wee taste of both their dishes. The haggis was lovely. Our friend, who has had many a haggis, said it was delicious, though not as spicy as he would've liked it. Jason said, ""let us know next time you're coming in; we'll spice it up for you.""  That's the kind of guy he is; a very professional barman and restauranteur. Always says hello and goodbye. He's very attentive (we like to sit at the bar) and eager to please, wanting to know how you like one beer, or suggesting another.  The hubby's sausage was wicked flavorful.  This past trip, he order the burger -ginormous! Very flavorful with the onions etc...it's the type of burger that you need two hands and several napkins to eat it with. Its also the type of burger that is hard to put down because it is so juicy and delightfully messy that you think, ""why bother? I'm just gonna get filthy all over again!""  The home cut fries, which my husband could not finish (a first!) were also outstanding.   My dish, the Tikka Masala (invented in a Glasgow Indian restaurant) was dee-vine. The smoked chicken, served on top of the spiced rice, was tasty in its own right, but combined in a forkful with the rice?! Oh me, oh my.  And i just love kohlrabi (or any green leafy weed) so 'nuff said there.  Others have already mentioned the Belhaven. I love the flavor, but am usually looking for a bit more of a bite; I had the Harpoon german amber. Very good. We will be back again and again.",5,9/30/2010,The Haven
1770,"First off, I really want to love this place.  I live down the street from The Haven and was looking forward to having a new favorite local hangout, but I sadly have to admit some disappointment.  Here is what I liked:  The burger was absolutely perfect.  Really, it was.  Unfortunately it was one of the only things on the menu I could eat, or wanted to eat.  I have a few allergies so that eliminated a few choices, but still, it would be nice to have a few things to choose from.  The atmosphere is great, a lot of eclectic and cool stuff decorating the walls. (Although a pair of antlers did come crashing down from the wall in the middle of dinner --luckily no one was sitting at the table below them.  I don't think that is a nightly occurrence though!)The beer selection was great.  The staff friendly and helpful.The bad part...a limited menu.  And the part that keeps me from going back.  The seats are so unbelievably uncomfortable that I don't want to go back and sit for any length of time in them!  The chairs are the standard blue hard school chairs and the benches are an odd height and have an odd angle...honestly uncomfortable!  The Haven is fairly new and I know it is evolving, hopefully they will get new chairs....and maybe update the menu a bit.  I will go back again for the burger, but I'll eat it at the bar next time.",3,10/4/2010,The Haven
1771,"Just came back from there, and my girlfriend and I are both stuffed.  It's small, intimate, cozy, and we sat under an amusing painting of a sheep.  We arrived at about 7:30 and got the last table.  An hour later the restaurant was almost empty but the bar was still going strong.  Had a great Scottish Beer called Kelpie Ale.The Haggis was okay, I'm never a big fan of Lamb's natural gaminess, but the mash of Parsnips, Rutabega and honey was a revelation.  My Beef and Ale Pie was perfect, with just the right kind of beef, yukon gold potatos and the slight surprise of mustard.  Unfortunately, it came out so hot that my girlfriend was almost finished with her meal before I could make a dent in mine.She had the Barley risotto, and called it ""surprising.""  The barley made the dish familiar but utterly different at the same time, and she raved about the inclusion of corn and the dish's overall ""texture.""Going back to try the Scotch Egg, the Haven Burger and the Cheese on Toast.  Also want to try the Toffee Pudding, and explore their great beer list some more.  Besides the dense oatcake they served with fresh butter at the beginning of the meal was worth a trip on it's own.  Chewy and just the slightest bit sweet.  Plus, I love that it's got a late night menu and is open until 1 AM!  This place could easily be an out of the way, more homey version of Brookline's Matt Murphy's pub, and I'll definitely bring my beer-oriented friends sometime!Four stars for atmosphere, good food, and for daring to do something different.  One of those restaurants that I don't want to see constantly packed, but I do want to be popular enough to insure it's survival.",4,10/5/2010,The Haven
1772,"I'm really disappointed to have to write this awful review because we love to support local. Our experience was so sad that we decided to not give it another shot. We tried to have brunch there on a recent Sunday morning. We were 2 of 7 customers there. It took several minutes for the waitress to bring our menus and then at least 10 minutes to get coffee. Sorry nope, no decaf. Okay can we have some tomato juice? Sorry no tomato juice. We have orange and cranberry. OK, but this is brunch. We ordered our breakfast and waited and waited and waited in the really uncomfortably cold restaurant. After 15 mins. another group of 6 arrived. Within a short time they ordered and got their breakfast. We asked our waitress how long it would be because I had to get to work. She said 1 minute. We waited another 5mins. and sadly we left. I got to work late and hungry and cold. I think they should bag brunch and probably stick to what the reviews say they do best.",1,10/25/2010,The Haven

1774,"I thoroughly enjoyed my first meal at the Haven a few nights ago. The sweet potatoes were delightful as was the kale and sausage. The chowder I got wasn't bad either and it all went nicely with the Scottish ale I had. Prices were decent and the service was good, even though it was so full on a week day night.. The atmosphere was nice, intimate, and chill. Jason the owner is a great guy and enthusiastic patron. The caramel pudding cake for desert was a nice touch and they really do offer something very different there with the menu, which is small, but offers some selection (and veggie options too). All in all - a unique place in a good location, good food and drink, and a nice atmosphere.",4,11/6/2010,The Haven
1775,"I never thought I could a love a restaurant as much as this, and have it so close to our home!First off, we generally have tried most of the restaurants in Jamaica Plain and have had great experiences, but we like to vary it up and try different ones, and there are a lot of restaurants in J.P. to choose from so it usually is awhile before we try a restaurant a second time. We moved to J.P. a little over 2 years ago, we tried the restaurant Zon's and enjoyed it and before we could try it a second time, it was closed! Fortunately the Haven has opened in Zon's old spot. In the few months it has been open, we have gone to the restaurant seven times, a record for us of any restaurant but especially amazing given the short time!We have loved absolutely everything on this menu and have almost gone completely down the entire menu, we have had, beef & ale pie, haggis, duck masala, beet salad, ""quackling"" salad, barley rissotto, the scotch egg (my wife had this, I'm not that into eggs), tomato bridie, coronation chicken sandwich, sunchoke cullen skink, sassitch and mash, and all four of their deserts (our favorite is the shortbread with chocolate dipping cups, with just a pinch of chile pepper) ... Needless to say, we've loved everything and are probably going to clear the whole menu in its entirety very soon! Parts of the menu change from time to time which is just great in our opinion, as you get to try something new each time. The staff is fantastic and the beers are delicious. My favorites are the Belgian Pale Ale and Belhaven Ale, my wife loves the harpoon wet hops. The joker IPA is also nice. If you like them on Facebook you can find out about various events and new beers coming out. They also give you some nice pickled vegetables and oatbread when you first sit down.  We have come here with as many as five people, on the weekends and during the week, and have never had to wait that long, and the place always has a good crowd. I can't recommend this place enough, as someone who generally doesn't go out a whole lot, this place keeps making us want to go back so much!",5,11/8/2010,The Haven
1776,"Excellent neighborhood bar/grill setup with great Scottish authenticity.Beer is moderately priced; portions are just right for the food items.  Homemade ketchup was excellent.  Yes, it's bar food, and from the Scottish tradition.  Expect beer, meat, carbs, and some spice.This is someplace you could socialize at or bring dates.  The chairs are a great throwback and work well.  I'll be a patron again!",4,11/16/2010,The Haven
1777,Myself and the misses went to that new Scottish Bar/Restaurant last night called the Haven in JP. It is just a walk away from me and it was really top notch. It really deserves to do well as the owner is sound and the food and atmos is quality. I will be going back. Looked like a decent place to sit and drink beer too.... I told the owner Jason I played soccer with NI/Scotland (a team here in Boston) and got a free deep friend mars. Score.I had the sausage with apple and the misses had the bridie and chips. Well we both shared everything and it was all fab.,5,11/17/2010,The Haven
1778,"I had to organize a board meeting last week, so I decided to try this place out. I honestly wasn't sure if I would like it (their menu seemed a bit limited), but I love trying new thing so I went in with an open mind. They were very nice when I made reservations for nine people, and we were seated right away.  I picked (at random) a Scottish golden ale and was a fan. What made the beer taste even better were the complimentary oatcakes that were served along side butter and some pickled veggies. I was skeptical at first (""um...do I like oat cakes?"") but fell in love with them. They honestly didn't even need the butter that came on the side. I don't know what's in these babies but I'd love to get my hands on some as a snack! They were a bit salty and chewy, and hit me right in the comfort food spot of my heart. Yay! A lot of people on Yelp suggested the coronation chicken salad sandwich, so I went for that. Now...I am usually very picky about chicken salad. One piece of gristle or too much mayo and I'm done. But I was very pleased with this! The bread was nice and crunchy (I think they toasted it/grilled it with oil or butter) and the salad wasn't insane with curry but there was just enough to keep it interesting. Just enough raisins and almonds, not too many to tick me off. I would definitely get this again. The sandwich also came with a side of ""chips"" (translation: very well seasoned potato wedges), and was served with a bottle of house made ketchup! My table killed almost half the bottle because it was so good. One board member ordered the Haven Burger (medium rare) and she was floored by it. She could barely even pick it up and it was pretty messy = exactly how a damn good burger should be! I will be getting this when I return! Another board member ordered the mussels and she was very happy with it. She wanted something lighter for dinner so this was a good option for her.  She kept dunking the grilled bread into the leftover ""sauce"" from the mussels, so it must have had some good flavor.The wait staff was kind and attentive, a little on the slow side but JP is chill so I wasn't surprised by this.  This is a good place for friends to catch up and grab a quick beer/bite to eat, and would also be a good date spot as well for a couple looking for something out of their comfort zone.",4,11/22/2010,The Haven
1779,"The waitstaff is nice and mostly from the old Alchemist. The place is busy, and everyone seems to have a good time. I'm not impressed by the food and find that both times I visited I settled and was left unfulfilled. People seem to love this place but for me, not so much.",3,11/23/2010,The Haven
1780,"Yeah, that was easy. Sold on the Haven. Wrap this puppy up and put it under the Christmas tree. This is a solidly fun spot. Not even teary eyed remembering Zon's (former inhabitant of the locale). Not...one...tear. Man up. Plaid up. Get your Scottish on. So inviting and simple. Not the food mind you, the idea. Good craft home made foods, like scary good. Haggis, scotch eggs, things I'm a little confused about but amazed by, and a solid beer list to melt your face away on a cold or rainy or even nice New England eve. The atmosphere is just what I have been looking for, a friendly mixture of antlers, Scottish memorabilia and soft lighting. Find me in a corner at the wee bar at the Haven sometime soon, I guarantee it.",4,11/23/2010,The Haven
1781,"Alright. I'm gonna do this thing. I'm gonna pony up and give The Haven 5 stars. Yeah. I feel good about this one.I was here last night for an event, and Jason (the owner) and his staff pulled out all the stops to ensure that all of us had a great time. First- the decor. This place is freaking sweet. Photographs of wildlife all over the walls, antler chandeliers, exposed brick and weathered wooden walls. The bathroom was also cool as hell. Jason wall-papered the loo with old soccer magazines, recipes, and other cool throw back stuff that he bought on E-Bay. This place is small, but it really makes for a cozy, intimate setting. Me like.Second- The food. I have to say I am pretty inexperienced in Scottish fare, but I am hooked. This stuff is good. I sampled a Scotch Egg, haggis, cheese toasties, a DEEP FRIED 3 Muskateers bar, and a delicious toffee pudding dessert. Third- The service. Bartender was fast and cute, waitresses were constantly coming around with new treats to try, and for a relatively new restaurant they handled our party with style and grace and didn't even break a sweat.Yeah, The Haven rules. Go check it out.",5,11/23/2010,The Haven
1782,"This is my new go-to pub in the neighborhood. I'm happy to know the only scottish bar in town is steps from my home. (despite my irrational fear of haggis)The owner Jason rocks. He's the kind of guy that takes note of the regulars and befriends everyone. You'll usually catch him sporting the latest in scottish fashion. Even coming in by yourself is a treat because he'll chat you up at the bar.  I found the food to be very good from what I've tried. So far on my tally sheet I have the haven burger (orgasmic), the Tomato Birdie (tasty but kind of small) and a deep fried Mars bar with the homemade whip (arteries just clogged a little, could only do a bite or two :x). I will most likely be scolded for missing the Scotch egg. My one gripe with this place is I manage to get a stomach ache about 70% of the time I eat here because the food is a bit dense. As much as I love their chips and homemade ketchup, I don't eat particularly heavy food regularly so it catches up with me. Also, they don't have a full liquor license so beer and wine only. This isn't a problem for me (btw Pretty Things and Harpoon on tap OMG!) but I have friends that will ONLY do cocktails and refuse to go to a bar without them. *kanyeshrug*",4,11/24/2010,The Haven
1783,The food was very good. I went with the lentil and kale stew without mushrooms and I was taken with the flavor of the broth and lentils. I also ordered a side of rutabaga which was an explosion of flavors in my mouth. We were seated immediately and greeted by Jason the owner who was very friendly. Our waitress also was very friendly and eager to answer questions about the menu. Portions are good sized and a good value. The atmosphere is intimate yet welcoming. Elementary school chairs are used for seating and are much more comfortable now than they were back in school. The music also was excellent and played like the best pandora mix. Overall very very happy with a new local place.,5,11/24/2010,The Haven
1784,"The Haven does everything right. First of all, if you don't like haggis, you will.  It's served here with a tiny bit of buttery neeps. Delicious. The fish and chips are right on. And the menu changes slightly with the seasons. They have the most wonderful meat and/or veggie pies (beef and ale, anyone?), and the beer selection is exceptional. I've been addicted to the Scull Splitter; it goes with everything and is priced just right. Seriously, it's pub food, but better. If you can appreciate a good burger (i.e. make your own or are invited to a 4th of July party once a year at which the burgers are to die for) then you will understand the pleasure of a Haven burger - toasted bun, sautéed onions and bacon. The atmosphere is great. They've been adding to the décor since they opened. The service is good, and I know it's been mentioned, but starting a meal with oat cakes and mild pickles beats dry bread and butter any day.",5,11/27/2010,The Haven
1785,"I give 5 stars because if you're looking for Scottish, well, this is Scottish.No it doens't have to be a pub with velvet booths and dark cherry wood.  The Haven is the new Scottish.  The menu is authentic as it gets and the owner is the bartender who supposrt an English football league if you can believe it.  Everything from the haggis, scotch egg and deep friend Mars bar screams Celtic.While chatting with the bartender/owner, he gave us a complimentary started of greens drizzled with a duck fat vinaigrette.  So simple but so delicious....and can I get some more of those Oat cakes!? delish.My british husband ordered the haggis who says it was awsome.  I great take on the original served with neeps. (parsnips)  I ordered the beef and ale pie that I couldn't even finish.  I must say the pasty on the pie IS THE BEST PASTRY I have ever had on a pie...EVER.  It was buttery and flaky I could have eaten just a bowl full of that.I asked the couple next to us if they enjoyed the duck curry and they both said it was the best curry they have ever eaten.  Now I'm not sure they are curry fans but it will be my next choice when I return......and that Mars bar!We passed on dessert as we were stuffed but the scent of mulled wine in the crock pot with brandy soaked apples sitting on the bar told us winter was coming.Plus they play the football matches...that's soccer to you yanks.",5,12/4/2010,The Haven
1786,"Still feeling the sadness from the loss of Zon's in JP (and I know it's been awhile, but that lamb burger makes me wince with pleasure every time I think about it) I was ready to discount The Haven before it even moved in. But then I remembered one thing; Scottish Beer. So I went during their first week open and I have to say, it made the passing of Zon's almost bearable. But I still crave that damn lamb burger!Anyways, back to The Haven. The decor is great, as others have said, and I can imagine bellying up to the bar for many hours drinking scotch ale and talking about kilts. I thought the schoolroom chairs were only temporary and they were still waiting for some of their furnishings, but it seems as though those hard cold chairs are sticking around. Small price to pay for the rest of what is offered at The Haven. The staff is amazing. We were welcomed with open arms, and even though the place was in its first week, they made it seem as though they'd been open for years and that we were neighborhood regulars and they had been expecting us all along. When the bartender accidentally forgot about us and left us with empty pint glasses for a bit too long, the owner, Jason, noticed and immediately rectified the situation, apologizing for the delay and offering to buy us our next round. We were flattered. My friend and I ordered the BIG SASSITCH (which is now the other sassitch) and it was amazing. The sausage itself was delicious, perfect for two people and delicately coiled on top of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, and I'm from Idaho, so I knows my potatoes, people. The plate also had some bbq spring onions which were almost better than the potatoes were. But probably the best part about the meal was the mustard gravy...and we ate every last bit of it. I haven't been back yet...but after reading the rest of the reviews, and listening to my other JP friends talk about their experiences, I can't wait to go back -- and am a little upset with myself for being so lazy about it. The Haven is definitely a huge benefit for JP -- and for Boston dining. A unique Scottish experience backed up by really really really good food, hard to find beers and a staff so friendly you'll have new friends the minute you walk in the place!",4,12/6/2010,The Haven

They play great music but it is played at a volume that allows for easy conversation --- ehm, ehm . . . pls take note Brendan Behan. The owner, Jason, is there almost every night, and he oversees the the evening workings of the newly opened pub with a playful ease: recommending food and drink and offering to let you taste a draft beer before ordering.The food is incredible. I had gone to the pub for drinks many times, but only recently, I ate there for the first time. The hamburger was one of the best burgers that I have had in years. The lentil stew was fantastic.Go there. Relax. Eat. It is a great spot.",5,12/7/2010,The Haven
1788,"I had the sausage and mashed potatos and it was very good.  I liked the large selection of Scotish beer and settled on the Joker I.P.A.  The atmosphere was a lot of fun, especially in the bar area.  The middle school chairs in the dining room took some getting used to and put bench the people taller than the ones in the chairs.  Overall, a good dinner spot and a great place to grab a beer.",3,12/13/2010,The Haven
1789,"I was so happy to see this place open up (RIP Zon's) and even happier to see it doing so well. If you want great food, an eclectic Scottish beer selection, and amazing service, then the Haven is the place to go. The owner Jason is usually behind the bar buzzing around the restaurant, checking in on diners and making sure things are running smoothly. The rest of the staff are amazing as well, and the atmosphere (dark, bustling, but rarely completely overrun) is lovely. They even do live music from time to time. This is an amazing addition to the JP landscape - you couldn't ask for a better, more laid-back place to hang out!",5,12/13/2010,The Haven
1790,They've rotated out the Harpoon drafts!!! In with some more Scottish classics!,5,12/15/2010,The Haven
1791,"Sat on the bar side with 3 friends...owner waited on us...friendly service with a smile. We ordered apps, Bridies (pastries filled with root vegetables) and Scotch eggs. Nice breads were served with pickled onions. One friend had ""the best hamburger I've ever tasted"",  fish and chips, a fish stew, and another burger...everyone was happy. The selection of beers was outstanding...we'll go again.",4,12/19/2010,The Haven
1792,"Nice addition to JP for sure.  Really nice service... and different in terms of cuisine.  It's a bit dank inside -- the place smelled overpoweringly of vinegar.. and something else that wasn't pleasant... Plus, it's one of those spots that feels a bit college dorm; most of the tables the night we were there had to see or look at a big, dirty, messy closet area (what is it with restaurants that don't understand that we really don't wanna see their food pantries?), even though there was a curtain hanging unused in front of it.  Put a swinging door or screen up.  And it'd help to replace those stacking chairs with some that are wooden.  The food was really good... although our beef pie had something in it that completely overpowered the dish (caraway?  ale?)..  Curious to know what they're going to do in the summer, when folks eschew this kind of food..?",3,12/29/2010,The Haven
1793,"Jackson Sq on the Orange Line!Had a good buddy make it in for New Years (amazingly), so I figured I check off a new stop while I waited for my girlfriend (stuck in Florence, SC) and my roomate (stuck in Chicago, IL).Like many restaurants, as I'm beginning to find in Boston, this place is kinda small (maybe 30 tables) at best, but the atmosphere was nice and dark, quiet, and scottish country side pub-like. I had the Beef and Ale Pie, which was some seriously tasty stuff. Since it was a Thursday, there was a small trio there playing celtic music which added to the authenticity of the place. I give it 3 stars because the service was kinda seriously slow, the table was too small, and the booth/chairs at the table were pretty uncomfortable. In addition, although what food there was good, the menu selection was kinda lacking. And for all the hype on the website, the Scottish beer selection was also pretty slim.I'd say: go check it out, the place is neat to go once, but probably not good enough to make it a regular thing.",3,12/30/2010,The Haven
1794,"Lovely new place in JP. I'd go here often if I lived closer! Super nice place, with tasty food and friendly staff. The burger I had was huge and greasy (and tasty) and my friend had a Scotch egg which was pretty damn good too. I need to try some more of the food here.Also, Belle & Sebastian is always a welcome music selection in my book. I need to go here more often!!",4,1/1/2011,The Haven
1795,"This place rocks - it's always warm and busy and everyone always seems happy to be there. Jason, the owner, is great at his job. He is the true definition of what a small business owner should be: he remembers customers, works his own bar, and checks in to make sure people are happy. The food and service is terrific. The menu's small and changes often, but I can always find something I like. I love the pickles and oatcakes that they start you off with. The fish supper and Scotch egg are delish, and I could eat their chicken salad every damn day. I am really happy that this place came to fill the void left by Zon's. Next time I'm trying the burger to see how it measures up. From what I hear, I'm in for a treat...",5,1/2/2011,The Haven
1796,"Amazing!! I have been to Scotland numerous times in my life and always loved the food and the people. The Haven truly captures the essence of Scotland from the unique decor of selected Scottish memorabilia on the walls, to the large selection of Imported Scottish Beer's, and a menu of very traditional food that is new and exciting to the landscape of Boston, but also having the characteristic of a really good home cooked meal! Definitely try the Haven!!",5,1/3/2011,The Haven
1797,"The Haven is a fun, low-key place. If you live near Stonybrook, this is your local. Casual: more of a place to bring your buddies than a place to go on a third date. The fish supper is HANDS DOWN the best fish & chips I've had (and I've had a lot). Why 4 stars instead of 5? The tables are a little crammed-in, I'd like it to have more beers on tap, and a better menu selection. But what they do, they do well.",4,1/4/2011,The Haven
1798,"Love The Haven. I don't know Scottish from the rest of the UK, but this is Good Stuff.  The first time I went I had a Scotch Egg and then the Fish and Chips.  So. Good.  My friend had the deep fried Mars Bar which I didn't know was Scottish, but was amazing nonetheless.  Thank heavens he ate the majority while his wife and I had 2 bites (or so) each.The food quantity is too much!  I've gone since and thoroughly enjoyed the quackling salad and a burger, both meals in and of themselves.  So much so I didn't finish as much as my taste buds wanted me to.  the burger was a juicy delicious mess suitable for fork and knife, so be ready!Christmas Eve my family (some in from Colorado) enjoyed the prix fixe menu and the beef and ale pie was over the top.  One cousin had the haggis (she claimed her Scotch heritage required her to order it, she's a cousin by marriage) and I dared a bite.  I have to admit it was good!Shocking!Thank Dog I live within walking distance, I'll be going again and more often.",5,1/12/2011,The Haven
1799,"Absolutely lovely place! Great atmosphere, great food, great everything. I actually tried haggis here for the first time and it was shockingly good. My friend had curried pheasant (or was it quail?) anyways it was wonderful. My heart however belongs to the deep fried mars bar with ginger whipped cream. The staff were friendly and helpful and overall I am excited to come back here.",5,1/12/2011,The Haven
1800,"absolute perfection.  I seriously have not one bad thing to say about this wonderful addition to my neighborhood.the decor and atmosphere is perfect for a chilly january night.  the food is, too.  the menu is small, but everything seems well-executed and I still had trouble deciding because it all sounded so good!  they have a great selection of beers, most of which I've never seen before.the service was friendly and informative.  I felt like I was a regular already.  I love that they make everything from scratch on site (except the bread).  I already can't wait to go back and know I will spend many evenings here.everybody at the haven: give yourselves a big round of applause.  you really deserve it.  I hope you are very successful!",5,1/16/2011,The Haven
1801,"The Haven just keeps becoming more and more fabulous! The mulled wine these days is the ultimate antidote to the cold weather and if you are a fan of fish and chips run, do not walk, to try the Haven's version.

1803,Amazing beer selection!  Every time I've stopped in the owner Jason and my favorite bartender Will have helped me choose from an awesome assortment of scottish brews to pair with many fabulous dishes!  I must say I am a sucker for the scotch egg and the orkney skull splitter.  I love the atmosphere and appreciate that the music playing is always eclectic. Favorite new neighborhood spot! Cheers!,5,1/21/2011,The Haven
1804,"The Haven is a wonderful winter hang out.  So warm, cozy and inviting -They have an incredibly welcoming staff, who all make you feel right at home.  They also have an really interesting selection of beers . . . Kelpie Seaweed Ale (described as chocolate/kelp ale)! How do you not want to immediately try that? [okay, it's actually pretty mild, but still, I had to try it]. The Haven creates a great ambiance and I would totally rank them five stars, but for a few drawbacks: 1.)  the food.  It's fine - it's Scottish food.  It may or may not be authentic, I can't tell - but I never sit around thinking, ""Man I want some Scottish food.""  The Haven hasn't changed my opinion on this.  I really tried to get excited about mushy peas - I really did.  But it's impossible.  They are just okay.  When sunchokes are heavily featured on the menu, you know you are in trouble.  Sunchokes are not delicious.  2.) no places for coats, which makes things kinda awkward, given 3.)  tables on the restaurant side are very close together.  JPers are friendly and all, but we don't need to be that close.  Especially when we have our coats falling all over each other.  Sorry about that, table next to us.",4,1/31/2011,The Haven
1805,"YUM!  This place is good for a winter supper.  We had the meat pie appetizer (great flavors), the mussels with bacon and hearty bread to soak up the sauce, and the duck with squash and rice.  I had two glasses of mulled wine; perfectly warm, not too sweet, good spices.  The staff was super friendly.  The bar is made out of beautiful wood.  The rest of the decor leaves something to be desired.  The set up is almost the same as Von's.   I will be back to try other things on the menu, including dessert, which sounded fabulous.",4,2/5/2011,The Haven

1807,Bellhaven was calling me after a long day.  Smooth ale is my new flavor.The place was packed as it should be and I squeezed through to the bar to get my Bellhaven.  Jason is always so cheerful and quick.  We relaxed around the bar as we waited for our table.Tried to say hey to Ben but he was busy in the kitchen so I didn't disturb him.The Scottish eggs are a delight.  With each bite the crust has an awesome crunch that shouts out at me...ooo la la.The mussels were full of flavor and also had a hidden crunch with every spoonful.  And spoonful I mean I also enjoyed the rich broth they were served in.Ended with the fried Mars bar with whipped cream.  I think I would have liked it more if they were bite sized but it was still yummy with the salt and sugar mix blended with the chocolatey goo.,4,2/15/2011,The Haven
1808,"It's not my fault, I promise, I'm new to the world of Scottish cuisine, and I'm sure most of you are too. Very, very excited to try Haggis and even more excited for what was promised to be a delicious burger, The Haven just didn't do it for me. I've eaten a wide range of cuisine in my day (still plenty out there to try) but Haggis was a new one. I'm not sure what I should have expected when I tried the Lambs' heart, liver, and lungs, but even in croquette form, it was just off-putting to me. I'm aware this is a burger blog, but it has to be noted, whatever flavor was present in the Haggis that I found so off-putting, seemed to be in the burger as well. Or maybe my palette was just thrown off and couldn't recover.  Could have been a combination of both, really, but I wasn't the only one among the four diners who felt this way. The burger looks good on paper, a half-pound patty with decent juice and char, topped with a bacon and onion marmalade, and Huntsman cheese. (the Stilton element of the cheese was a bit too aggressive) All in all, it's sized well, the bun plays a good complementary role, although the burger itself is much closer to medium-well than the requested medium-rare. But again, that flavor comes back to haunt me, something in that burger reminds me of something in that Haggis and I just can't get past it. Hard to describe, it's assertive, unfamiliar and mostly unpleasant. Trying it's best to be a burger, it's far too different for my seemingly delicate taste buds. Chips, or really thick pub fries if you will, are inconsistent. Some are fluffy and crispy, most are dry and soft, all are pretty under-seasoned, but a few splashes of salt and vinegar at the table quickly solves that problem.It's tough to be so hard on a place where the servers are a delight, there is passion up and down this quaint little spot in JP,  and everyone seems so happy. But it's just not for me. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try it, food is so subjective, someone else may have a completely different experience and absolutely love the Scottish food served at The Haven, but in the world of Boston's best burgers, this one doesn't measure up.",2,2/20/2011,The Haven
1809,"Came back twice b/c my friends keep raving about their brunch (and its winter, so no concerns about the A/C) and its burger. While I was not surprised that lunch was pretty sparsely populated, I was shocked that on a Sat at 11, it was almost empty, I figured it was either b/c 1)  the food sucks or 2) nobody knows that they serve brunch, and the answer is #2. Their breakfast sandwich was HUGE on a nice brioche, thick sausage on a potato thing of some sort with cheese, really well balanced. Heavy, but not greasy. The accompanying beans were delicious. I split a scotch egg, which was decent, nothing that rocked my world, but crisp and nicely balanced by a well seasoned bed of arugula. Their burger is pretty good, quite juicy, great onions and sauce on a nice brioche, definitely one of the better ones in Boston. For $15/person after tax/tip? WOW. I'm kinda glad that lunch and brunch are not yet so popular b/c I love having no wait, no competition for our server's attention, and getting our food quickly. Sh*t, I should just delete this review...",4,2/26/2011,The Haven
1810,"Finally, finally! I've been meaning to come here since the Yelp Elite event here, which I missed do to a cold. So glad I did. With four dining companions and a reservation at 8:30 we arrive to a full house. We're told that the dinner party at our table is finishing dessert, so it should be available soon. Unfortunately one of my friends could tell from the looks of one woman at the table with very animated hands, and even more animated mouth, they were definitely not leaving soon. As we wait by the bar, after 20 minutes, Jason, the owner, God bless him, goes over to the table and ask them kindly that another reservation was waiting for the table. Now that's attentive service.On such a cold evening my friends did partake of the mulled wine, which they thoroughly enjoyed. Another had a seaweed ale which he said was quite good. Even with a limited menu in terms of choices, what they had to offer was excellent. The mussels, which we thoroughly soaked every piece of bread we could muster in it's delicious juices. The beef and ale pie, with a flaky crust, containing piping hot stew of braised beef with leeks, potatoes, and carrots. A large portion of fish and chunks of chips. The sassitch and mash, a tasty homemade sausage with garlic and herbs. Finally for dessert truffles of various unique and interesting flavors, my favorite being the coconut and curry.Service was friendly and attentive, and Jason made it a point to have a nice talk with us and remembered my name as I left. Top notch fellow.Of course they offer the traditional haggis, and someday I'll try this. I get the feeling I will be a repeat customer. Those who are fortunate enough to work in the area, they start serving lunch as of this Tuesday :)",4,2/26/2011,The Haven
1811,"I went to The Haven with a friend after being turned away from the nearby Canary Square on a busy friday night.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the closing scenes of Braveheart playing on the TV while waiting about 15 minutes to get service.  The deviled eggs with arugula salad were delicious but unfortunately we weren't brought a fork until the end of the meal.  So we used our hands. Trying to get the attention of the barkeep Jason was a pretty lost cause as he was busy scanning the room for possible victims/customers. While we waited on our food we had some oat cakes with butter, which were probably the blandest thing i've ever tasted. I understand that this is traditional Scottish fare, but how boring are these people, really? The interior has a nice ambiance but was basically a huge postcard for Scotland tourism. If I wanted to go there, I'd buy a plane ticket. If you don't like zesty food or attentive service, this is your place!",1,3/1/2011,The Haven

1814,"Fantastic food. I ordered the cherry sage sausage and it was like nothing i have had before. If you are looking for scottish cuisine or simply want to treat yourself to something new this is the place.

And that's awesome!I love the oatcakes that come to the table unrequested. They are strangling bland and yet intoxicating. Simple. Delicious. The sides that are veggie are noted as such, and I always get the trifecta: minted mushy peas, hand-cut chips, and braised purple kale. I am salivating just thinking of those three things together. Add in a Scottish Session or two, and it's a night.",5,3/15/2011,The Haven

1824,"Went to The Haven on our way to the Pogues show with friends who live in the neighborhood. Wow. I guess the first thing is it is so Scottish. That might seem obvious, but it seems there is an amazing gravitational pull to dumb down, Americanize, or hybridize restaurants. It's refreshing the they are all Scottish, full speed ahead.   The owner Jason was really warm and welcoming and charming. The wait staff were also nice and did a good job. The atmosphere is cool and comfortable.As a serious beer nerd, I was glad they had a great mix of interesting beers. For food I had the Scotch Deviled Egg and the Fish Supper (minted mushy peas!), which were amazing. All the food is made in house with local ingredients. By all, I mean we asked for ketchup: made there. Hot sauce: Drambuie apple hot sauce in a jar.My wife had Sassitch and mash - house made cherry and sage sausage with stilton-chive mash and red wine-braised cabbage.

1827,"Way back in my wee yelping days I said this about The Haven's predecessor: ""Zon's is the kind of place you can take anyone to. First date? Perfect. Parents in town? Good for that too. Need good food before heading over to the Behan? Not a better place around. Next time my mother-in-law is in town we are taking her here. Next time my brother is in town we are taking him here. It's that sorta good. I wanna take everyone here just so I can go again."" Replace Zon's with The Haven and it all still applies. And, not to sound sacrilege, because I dearly loved Zon's, The Haven does everything just a little better. First, the service. Always lovely. Always warm. I met the owner, Jason, before they were even close to opening because he was selling a bunch of leftover Zon stuff. I now have Zon's old dining room chairs, nicely refurbished, in my dining room. His excitement about the new place was contagious- I couldn't wait for it to open. And it seems that excitement trickles down to the rest of the staff as well. Second, the food. Oh my god, best fish and chips on this side of the pond. The mushy peas! The homemade ketchup! The perfectly crispy fish! It's UK heaven on a plate! And, yes, Husband says the haggis is really good too. Not that he can compare it to anything not having been to Scotland and there only being one Scottish restaurant in the area. He says it's got that umami flavor that makes you want to keep shoveling it in your mouth. Get the haggis omelet at brunch. And finally, because it's so good it deserves it's own paragraph: the deep fried mars bars. Full context- I'm not a huge dessert person and I hate mars bars. I don't like chocolate that much and I don't like caramel and I really don't like chocolate and caramel together. Unless, it seems, they've been battered and deep fried. Words can't really come close to describing it, but if I had to pick one? Divine. Truly, truly divine.",4,4/20/2011,The Haven
1828,"I've been a devoted regular of the Haven pretty much since it opened, 5 blocks from where I live.  By regular, I mean I go there about once a week - sometimes more - usually for dinner and a couple of pints.Initially, I was in love with the atmosphere, the fish supper, the vegetarian special, the pickles that they bring to the table.  The beer and the mostly friendly service made it feel special.  Price-wise it was more in the category of ""dining out'  than ""pub grub"" but I felt, at first, that the quality merited the expense.But I have been let down, the last couple of months.  The vegetarian entree (which, for many of my friends, is the only option) once a tasty, earthy lentil dish is now a flavorful but salty and very uneven risotto (Is it really a good idea for a pub to offer risotto? last time, the rice was undercooked).  The fish pieces are sometimes 1/2 the original size (and the same price).  I've had to send back sides that were under-cooked and cold.  Not just the quality of the offerings but the treatment of the customers has also been disappointing. Like the time that my friend and I sat at the bar, ordered a couple of rounds and then started a tab for dinner - we were charged for 6 beers more than we had (every time one of us ordered a beer it had been tabbed as a round) . . . and when my friend politely questioned our bill he was treated rudely, and very grudgingly a few beers were taken off, as if as a favor.Yes, I'm disappointed that this place that I used to take friends to with a sparkle in my eye as in ""You won't believe how good this place is"" . . .and ""It's a bit spendy but totally worth it"" is now a place that I'm wishing would pull up its socks and start taking care of its customers, rather than hoping we'll be too drunk to notice the declining quality of the food.After the closure of the Alchemist and Zon's the Haven seemed a likely candidate for beloved local treasure but I think the position is still open.",2,5/2/2011,The Haven

Jason, the owner, has a lovely (but understandable!) brogue, which I found myself starting to mimic after a few drinks, and the food was delicious and authentic.  Jason made great beer suggestions (Innis & Gunns is my new favorite.) He was totally accommodating when we declared our love for his haddock balls (part of the smoked fish plate), and brought  out a whole plate of just his balls for us.

1830,"This is a fantastic intimate spot in the Hyde Park section of JP.  The theme all around is Scottish, and it applies to the decor, the owner, the fine selection of bottled Scottish ale and the food (my god, the food).  You definitely get the feeling you've been transported somewhere else, and remarkably,  you are never beaten over the head with kitsch or cheap Americanized mash-ups.  The burger is hands down the best within a square mile, and everything else looks dangerously appealing.  Back to the burger... its primal, its succulent, and you may need a shower when you forfeit the plate.    Intimate means this place fills up fast, and If you're hoping for bar seats you're better off trying for an off-peak time or day.  Awesome addition to the area.",5,5/17/2011,The Haven
1831,"I was really excited to try this place as I am new to the area and was looking for a new regular place to hang out. A Groupon popped up a few days after I found out about this place and thought it was perfect! However, I guess I missed it on The Haven website that they only serve lunch during the week.....what sense does that make?! Granted my coupon was only good for breakfast, brunch, or lunch so I was limited on when I could use it. But how are people who work supposed to get there for lunch? The breakfast was delicious and the portions were great. However, as I am a vegetarian my only real option was the french toast which was good but really sweet with the toffee topping. My boyfriend got the Breakfast Sandwich which he said was really good. Definitely plan on going back to try the beer selection and take part in one of their trivia or music nights. I am really excited to try their lunch/dinner options. Hopefully I can add a star or two after I get to eat what I really want to try!",3,5/18/2011,The Haven
1832,"Pros- adorable atmosphere, friendly wait staff, prompt service, great beer menu, fresh foodCons- only brunch on the weekends (please give more options than eggs or french toast at 1:30pm), food is about $2 more than i want to pay for brunchyeah- i was disappointed that the groupon i got forced me to get salmon and egg scramble ($15?!)  and not this burger everyone is drooling about. let me drool!  i want to drool! i could see the potential of the place and wish the groupon had allowed me to come and see the place in full swing. brunch is not this place's strong suit.i guess i'll sulk around for a bit... and huff and puff about the lame groupon.",3,5/23/2011,The Haven
1833,"If you have dinner plans for 7:30 and you don't end up leaving the restaurant until past midnight, chances are you had a good time -- I certainly did at the Haven. Will the Bartender totally confirmed my theory that sitting by the taps is the way to go. We got instant drink gratification, food suggestions and bar banter that we might have missed if we'd been seated at a table. Plus the chance to try some oatcakes (super hearty) and delightfully tart currant mead. The entrees were solid; I got a giant sausage plate (teehee) that was well-balanced and juicy. The chicken tikka masala looked like serious business. Then came the pièce de résistance: deep-fried mars bar! Just as eye-closingly good as I remembered from the Elite event, and I will never leave the Haven without ordering one.For antler chandeliers, a bathroom covered in clan tartans, beer that allegedly tastes like pine trees, cozy conversation by a roaring (fake) fireplace and the chance to attain mouth bliss, please proceed to your nearest Scottish bar/restaurant. Oh wait, there's only one in Boston. See you there ;).",4,5/23/2011,The Haven
1834,"My friend and I went to the Haven for a Saturday brunch and it was delightful! I'm more or less a vegetarian, so I was sort of curious about the options. However, to my surprise, they were dynamic and flavorful. I had the quiche with a buttery layered crust, a lightly salted arugula salad and tasty potato wedges. Also, the catsup is what's up. Totally boss. The bread at the start was great, oaty and light. I had a beer that was too heavy for the morning, but that's my own fault. Usually, I like to kick it here late-nite, but I will be back in the AM to check out the rad sheep art and nosh on their fare. The music was cool too, Belle & Sebastian were on, repping for Scotland. LOVE IT.",4,5/23/2011,The Haven

1836,"The skinny: drab ambiance, mundane flavors, chic prices.The dip: took my friend here since it looked like a novel experience. The reviews were pretty good overall, too. I love Scottish music, and have been looking forward to trying some of the food.So without being mean, the food was just really lousy. I'm not expecting the world's most exotic flavors or passion fruit cocktails from this place. But we ordered Scottish Eggs, Haggis and Neeps, Fish Supper, and Sassij and Mash.Google what scottish eggs and haggis and neeps is. I'll tell you that the flavors they had at this place were mundane. The devil was weak, with no bite. The haggis was not strong. OK so obviously I'm not a Scottish food expert, but it just was really boring and unmemorable.The main courses were Fish Supper (fish & chips) and sausage with mashed potatoes. The cost of each plate was $17+. And honestly, a total ripoff. The fish and chips was totally void of any sort of flavoring, the batter nothing but a sponge for oil. It was cooked well, it wasn't oily, but no flavor whatsoever. The cream sauce was more like weak sauce. And the minty peas was bad. The sausage with mashed potatoes was similarly bland, tasteless, and just a waste of money.Oh, and I almost forgot the dessert, that's how boring it was. Some sort of bacon-based crackle and chocolate and begnet and also ice cream. Meh. I've experienced better.I don't mean to be an idiot, but after this dinner I felt like I ate a big bowl of oatmeal with some boiled meat. If this is good quality Scottish food, then I apologize. Maybe it's what it's supposed to be. But unless you know you like Scottish food, avoid this place. It's just bland flavors everywhere.That's all I have to say. I'm bored writing this review.",2,6/1/2011,The Haven
1837,"I went to The Haven for brunch with some friends, very excited to try this much-raved-about venue.  Walking in, I immediately loved the atmosphere, with a lot of wood, and old pub feel.  The beer selection (what is brunch without a good beer?) was great, and much of it was Scottish, keeping with the theme.  The brunch menu was interesting and unique.  I had the salmon and eggs, which was very good.The big ""however"" is that the prices were just too high.  $15 for brunch has too be great to be worth that price, and although this was good, it wasn't $15 good.  In the event I need a little more detail to back my case, portion sizes were small-ish and some dishes ordered didn't come with toast or something to add more substance.  When a side of toast was ordered, it was $4.  Granted, it was likely local bread, and the condiments were home-made, but if you're already charging dinner prices for brunch, include toast.I will probably try dinner at The Haven, as the atmosphere was great, and dinner might be worth the prices, and I will definitely grab a beer there.  But brunch will not be had there again, by me.  There are excellent places in this city for brunch, with dramatically lower prices.",3,6/5/2011,The Haven
1838,In three months I will be MOVING to Scotland. I will unendingly miss The Haven. Wicked dumb right? Well the owner (who I am secretly in love with) won't be in Scotland. The free coffee refills won't be in Scotland. The Scottish Blend tea won't be exciting when I'm in Scotland. It won't be in JP.I'm leaving my favorite Scottish pub behind to go to stupid Scotland.,5,6/7/2011,The Haven

""Homemade ketchup,"" it whispers....Replace my morning cup of coffee with Haven homemade ketchup. Though the last couple of times I've gone, it's a little less awesome version of my dream-ketchup, but still. THE KETCHUP. THE BURGER. THE PICKLED VEGGIES. THE CAPSLOCK. I guess try the desserts, they're good too. And the beer (Skull Splitter, I like it). Whatever. Ketchup.",5,6/11/2011,The Haven
1840,"I've been wanting to try Haven for a while in empathy for my wife's Scottish ancestry. We live pretty far form JP, so we were only able to do brunch which has  a much more limited menu. It was slightly disappointing that the much heralded Haven Burger wasn't available, but that was my only let down. Our curly- haired waitress was absolutely perfect- the right blend of personality, attentiveness and what I believe was once called moxie. We liked her a lot.I had KILLER porridge with strawberries and cream, just a taste to start, but it was really good. Then I had the full Scottish breakfast with runny eggs over baked beans (not the British kind in the blue can that taste like candy, some sort of special crazy highlander warrior beans that blew my mind). I wasn't completely in love with the blood sausage- could have been a bit crispier- but the bacon was 100% porkalicous. Wife had breakfast sandwich and looked very happy, our son had the same. Good strong coffee.Of particular note: the owner Jason is very personable and took a moment to speak to us.I very much appreciated the Scottish playlist: a bit of Camera Obscura, English Beat, Teenage Fanclub- there was an old flyer for Orange Juice (the band) in the men's room- gotta appreciate that.I look forward to returning for dinner. If the Haven was in an old bar room filled with dark wood and stag's head on the wall and a photo of Sean Connery with flowers around the frame, there would be lines down the block.",4,6/13/2011,The Haven
1841,"Brunch was way overpriced and wasn't that special.  I had the breakfast sandwich and for $13, I was expecting something amazing.  It was dry and kind of mushy.  My friend had the toffee french toast and commented ""if toffee is mentioned twice int he description, shouldn't you be able to taste it?""I might go back and try them fro dinner, but I'll skip the brunch.",2,6/19/2011,The Haven
1842,"Great fish and chips, excellent pastie for a starter, lots of other food from GB that you don't see very often over here.Some of the chairs seem to have been salvaged from a closed school (blimey, me back!).  Only cider is Harpoon.Overall really good.",4,6/19/2011,The Haven
1843,"Last night my friend and I trekked out to JP for the Sam Adams Summer Open House... only to realize that I idiotically got the dates wrong and it had happened the night before.  To salvage our trip we decided we would make the most of our time in the Stony Brook neighborhood and proceeded to walk over to The Haven.  We walked in to a dark yet decidedly friendly feeling space.  The antler lighting is incredible, and theres definitely a cool vibe.  We snagged the last 2 seats at the bar and said hello to our friendly barkeep.The selection of beers is wonderful.  I consider myself to be an amateur afficionado and I was confronted with many bottles I'd never heard of.  I chose an insanely delicious and crisp Grozet gooseberry wheat and my girl got the Skull Splitter based on name alone.  It was very fruity, yet heavy, an odd brew.  We were impressed with our selections and the reasonable pricing.  They don't have a full liquor license although I was pleased to see many bottles of Fernet in the back of the bar.We had both kind of already eaten, but can't turn up a chance to try some new things so we ordered the goat cheese and potato dumplings to share.  These fluffly bites are what I dream gnocchi will taste of without the inevitable disappointment of a heavy rich gnocchi.  They were light and flavorful and the accompanying pesto was incredible.  I should mention here that we were presented with two full size portions as a ""Welcome to The Haven"".  Incredible service and perks from an already friendly and welcoming staff.I was completely won over by this place, and even though its a ways out for me by MBTA, I plan on returning.",5,6/25/2011,The Haven
1844,"What an absolute gem!  This is the sort of restaurant that everyone dreams would open up in their neighborhood - consistently delicious food at a fair price,  kind and caring waitstaff, homey feel, unexpected brews and libations, lively patrons, funky art ... where you can feel equally comfortable bringing your grandmother as you can your anarchist, nudist ex-boyfriend that used to dabble in heroin. I've been to the Haven twice now, once over the winter for some fabulously boosey mulled wine and tonight, for a most memorable dinner. Tonight the Haven was hosted a meet-up event for Reddit and it was packed. The Haven thrived off the nerdy energy and the kitchen churned out six FABULOUS dinners and my friends and I were in absolute nirvana. We all sampled each others plates and it was universally agreed upon that every dish we ordered was epicly delicious. (Update: 2018 - why did I go to a Reddit meet-up event??!?!?!? Who does that?!?!)Some restaurants have trouble managing large crowds and the food suffers and the management becomes flustered but not the Haven. The waitstaff was beyond charming and welcoming and really made us all feel at home. Sometimes, concerned waitstaff comes off as obnoxious and condescending, like the restaurant owners just want to pad their egos with positive feedback.  There was none of that crap at the Haven. Just caring and genuine interest. Our waitress, Leana, was a total sweetheart and the owner was kind and funny and I wish the Haven many more years of success!  Diana also rules (2018)And, I also wish that the Haven would open a  second branch closer to my apartment in Inman Square.  Everything was  sooo sooo good and  I know I'm going to start inventing reasons to journey to JP more often!",5,6/25/2011,The Haven
1845,"Love The Haven.  I was so thrilled when I heard a Scottish pub was going to open just round the corner from my apartment, and it hasn't disappointed.  The food is excellent (I've enjoyed brunch, lunch, dinner and late night snacks on many occasions - but not all on the same day...), the staff are warm and friendly, and they even have cider on tap. OK, not GREAT cider but that's impossible to find in Boston.  (Why is that, by the way?)  But cider nonetheless and that keeps me happy.  The decor is great and I love the atmosphere - quiet enough (unless it's a very busy night) that you can actually TALK to your companions!  Brilliant.  I've brought many friends to The Haven and they all have been converted - we love the place.",5,6/26/2011,The Haven
1846,"I went here once with my friend for dinner on a weeknight, so it wasn't busy, but had a good amount of people.  The vibe and atmosphere is great, and I love the Scottish theme.  The beer choices are so different from other bars I have seen, and even the wine selection was awesome!  It was here at The haven that I was introduced to Spanish Albarino wine. It's the best white wine I have ever had, and it was all thanks to the suggestion of our awesome server.  My friend and I both got the Sassitch and Mash. It was SO good.  I kept saying I was full and I couldn't finish it, but I couldn't stop myself and it was worth it.  Bottom line, I love this place for a dinner setting.  I have yet to show up on a weekend night to check out the scene then, but I'm sure its funky and fun.  I wish I lived in JP so I could go more often!",5,6/27/2011,The Haven

1848,"My partner and I were here for lunch on a Monday. A friend had recommended it, and we are very happy she did! We were a little hesitant because of the very limited lunch menu (a few salads and sandwiches), but it turns out the limited menu has resulted in them doing it all very well. The coffee was rich and strong, the service outstanding. We shared the Field Shoot Salad, which was perfectly dressed. The oat cakes were close to perfection. My partner ordered the Haven Burger, which he deemed to be ""the best burger I have had in my entire life."" I ordered the Haven Veggie Burger, which was also very, very good, albeit a little unappetizing to look at. A definite five star!",5,7/18/2011,The Haven
1849,"The Haven for hipsters that is.  Seriously everyone who was here when I was, was a hipster.  Not that I dont like hipsters....Anyway I went here for sunday morning brunch.  Got a Scotch egg as an appetizer and the breakfast sandwich.  The Scotch egg was delicious but it came with arugula which I dont think any chef can make taste good.  The dipping mustard for the Scotch egg was spicy but I liked it.  The Breakfast sandwich came with homemade baked beans which I thought were good.  The Breakfast sandwich was very big and very heavy.  I ate at noon and I was still not hungry at six.  It is stuffed with an egg, a sausage, some kind of patatoe thing with a sause.  I thought the sandwich as a whole was too greasy, but I finished it... ALL OF IT!!!",3,7/19/2011,The Haven
1850,I really dig this place. It's super casual and the food is SO good. For dinner I've tried the curried chicken sandwich and the burger which were both amazing!  I also stopped by for brunch and had the Scotch Egg along with the Salmon and Ramp Scramble which were both SOOO delicious. The scramble was packed full of flavor and just so unexpectedly wonderful! The prices are right on point and they do a fairly good job of getting you seated quickly. They also have a small bar area with a wonderful listing of brews. Definitely worth venturing to JP for. From their website it looks like they have live music pretty frequently. Definitely another great reason to head back!,4,8/5/2011,The Haven
1851,"Nice cozy tucked-away location in JP. It's probably bad that I live close to it because I will probably go for a Scotch egg at least once a week (maybe even a deep fried mars bar). So much for taking better care of myself. Still, I will be dreaming of Scotch eggs to get me through the week, fried crisp exterior (but not heavily greasy), juicy sausage interior with a core made of a hard boiled egg. I sort of wonder if there could be a Cool Hand Luke-like competition where someone tries to eat 50 Scotch eggs. Then again, eating 50 regular hard boiled eggs is enough of a strain on the body, so I think I'll just eat mine one at a time.It took a bit to get my beet salad out since they had just run out of greens and had someone run off to the store to buy more greens. It was totally worth it though. Delicious pickled beets, fresh greens, pungent goat cheese... mm.The chef was nice enough to cover the salad since it took so long. I wasn't exactly in a hurry, so it's all good.I'll definitely go back to check out the burger I keep hearing about. I just didn't think my circulatory system could handle the deliciousness of a Scotch egg AND a burger. I'm always glad to discover a new place to meet up with friends and enjoy tasty food.The Haven also has a Wednesday fry night and the featured item this month is a deep fried s'more, so I'm definitely going to have to check that out.",5,8/8/2011,The Haven

Like others have mentioned, a bit expensive for brunch, but overall quite good.",4,8/15/2011,The Haven
1853,"The ambience, the food, and the drinks were all great. The service was good. Loved how the black and white photo of Sean Connery (as Bond) was strategically placed at the bar to remind you that you were in a scottish joint. Very dark on the inside, could see this being a very cozy spot in the winter. For a drink I got the Sassenach--a Pim's cup--which was very good and refreshing on a summer evening. For dinner I had grilled scallops and blood sausage over a sweet corn puree with herbed green beans. I honestly didn't expect it to be so good. My only complaint is that the portion seemed a bit stingy for the price. My friend got some fries and those were good too. They're big and thickly cut (not the kind I typically like) but I still thought they were very good. At the bar they also have a deep fried suggestion box where if you can dream it, they can fry it. The bartender told me they have a weekly fry on Wednesdays when they fry up all sorts of goodies. Will definitely attend one of those, but only after fasting for a day or two :-) Good collection of people--people of all ages, a hipster or two (it is JP afterall) and even a guy in a kilt. So there you go for authenticity :)",4,8/15/2011,The Haven

Went here with groupon in hand for lunch (didn't realize it was only for brunch and lunch until the day before it expired - whoops!).I was disappointed at first because there's hardly anything that seems Scottish on the menu for lunch. No haggis? Really!? I came here for the haggis! and they were out of the homemade sausage. So I was left with little choice but to order the amazing-sounding Haven Burger.""Grilled 8oz beef chuck, Huntsman cheese, Haven bacon onion marmalade, house pickle sauce, lettuce on a brioche bun"" Yeah, yummy. I don't know if you can taste any of these elements individually, but dear Lord, you don't need to. They work together like The Bay City Rollers. And it's juicier than them too. In fact, it's so juicy I almost wanted to make a meat smoothie out of that thing. Yeah, that sounds HOT, right?Oh, and lest I forget the baconated baked beans. It's even better than it sounds. I must say, that did taste Scottish, though I couldn't say why.And the Scottish lad who helped us (possibly northern English and not actually Scottish) was top notch.Alas, I must knock off one star, both for the $14 price of the burger and the lack of haggis! I love haggis, and it just broke my wee heart a bit to not find it. I just suppose I'll have to stumble in one (hopefully) glorious night to test it out. Maybe they'll give a discount to a lad with a Celtic complexion.",4,9/28/2011,The Haven

Big juicy, hand patted burger. Really doesn't get better.Also -- everything *everything!* here is made from scratch. Only exception is the bread, which comes from a local bakery.

1864,"Okay, I'm in my 40s and it seemed like every dinner out with friends (NO kids), was turning into a bank run. Yes, I love great food, but something has to give with these $150 nights out. So, armed with Zagat and Yelp knowledge, I steered my husband and friends to The Haven one Saturday evening about two weeks ago. I will be going back...and back...and back again.The evening started off with a drink called the Braveheart and then dinner to boot. I'm not going to go on about the food. Suffice it to say, the menu had the perfect number of options and all were fabulous. (No, I will not be tasting haggis ever again, though.)It's the atmosphere that was the best part. We had great conversation, good friends, fantastic service and never felt rushed. It's been a long time since I've been out with friends and have felt just a hint of what life was like way back when, before kids, before real jobs, before life actually started moving somewhere.Thank you, The Haven, for just being.",5,10/9/2011,The Haven

It can seem a little slow in there sometimes, but that's part of what I like- I feel like I'm at an old friend's house- you can stay and eat your meal and drink your pint without ever feeling rushed.  The owner, Jason, is often working at the bar and hugs us when we come in. Did I mention the food is fantastic? Their burger is my favorite burger in town. Their haggis, sausage, blood pudding, and steak pies are home made, beautifully spiced, and utterly delicious (better than any I had when I lived in Scotland!). They use fresh ingredients and change the menu seasonally. The brunch is also among my favorites in JP (where we have a LOT of brunch choices). They have a small, but well-curated selection of beers and other drinks, and even Irn-Bru for Scotland enthusiasts! The Haven hosts awesome local musicians. Because the space is pretty small their events have the feel of a cozy house show. I can't like this place enough. From local food to Boston musicians and visual artists to familiar faces, this is a neighborhood establishment through and through. Cheers!",5,10/13/2011,The Haven
1866,"The burger is OUT of this world good. The oatcakes they serve at the beginning are also delicious. My friends tell me that the alcohol selection is very good, with a number of recommendations for the haven heather ale. The haggis is actually pretty good as well.Monday's are trivia nights, and every team gets a free deep fried mars bar. The trivia is the right difficulty and the questions are fun.

A manly, primal, meat- and fry-laden something that will last as long as they'd like it to. If these guys don't offer a welcome, whether with a warm plate or a warmer handshake, I'll eat my haggis.The bar seats seven, the dining room another 25 or so and the chandelier reach out with antler hands. Hantlers. cHantlerier. My head hurts. Belhaven on tap, or Kelpie in hand, the Scottish brews come out swinging. Keep your hands up, lest you leave with a cavity and/or a mighty fine buzz.Let me order for you: a Scotch egg (one of the area's first, and arguably the best!), a beef and ale pie and the fried Mars bar just to pop that gluttonous stomach of yours. The egg is remarkable, even more so if you're a salt-craving ungulate, while the savory beef and ale pie passes the lips like meaty ambrosia and sits like a fireplace - warm and tiring. I loved every bite. The Mars bar just because you have to; I mean, it's right there. This is mind, don't dare skip the pre-meal oatcake. It's the heartiest insulation you'll ever think you're eating.The crew has fun, the guests are never bitter and soccer is always running cross the wee TV. If The Haven were any more homey, it'd be a Wayans clown. With the prime spot on Perkins St being so central to Hyde Square Circle, I bet they could charge their regulars rent. And I know those folks would pay it.",5,10/16/2011,The Haven
1868,"I've only been a couple of times, but I've been super happy with everything each time - the food, drink, staff, atmosphere, etc. The brunch and dinner are equally as good (and having Harpoon Cider w/ a brunch of quiche and oat cakes is the best).Let me tell you, I've never had duck before tonight, but I gave their confit duck and roasted squash salad a try and I was blown away. Like...I want to kiss whoever made it on the mouth. It was that good. I don't normally spend $10 on a salad, but that one is totally worth it.",5,10/22/2011,The Haven
1869,"I have gone here three times now and have loved it every time. All the food I have had has been absolutely delicious. The scotch egg when deviled is definitely a highlight, the lamb haggis is damn tasty, even the BLT has enormous pieces of thick cut bacon and really good bread. Everything down to the salads has been unique and a total treat. If you are there for dinner try the apple pie in a glass for desert, it is the perfect deconstruction of an apple pie as apple pie mead with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. The deep fried mars bar is also good, one of those things you have to try once in life. Their imported beer selection is very good, I especially enjoyed the Skullsplitter Ale.The service is excellent, the bartender/waiter was the perfect mix of snarky, helpful and hilarious. The ambiance is fantastic, good music, interesting decor, good lighting.Overall this is one of my favorite places in Boston and I just wish it was closer.",5,10/25/2011,The Haven
1870,"Now, read this as if you are hearing Oprah Introduce it: ""IIIIIIIInnnnnnnnnCCCccreeeeeeddddiiiibbbbbllllee""Love the burger there. It is so flavorful and even just smells like you would want to swim in it. The fries are like potato wedges and you can get them with the vinegar on top. Do it.My S.O. loves that they have a kilt night (Fridays I believe) and we've been to the trivia night as well. Participation in either will get you a free (delicious) Fried Mars Bar.Great place, friendly staff, awesome dedicated owner. Try the Haven Heather Ale! I'm a big fan.",5,10/27/2011,The Haven
1871,"So this is the one (1) venue that my choice to try out a vegan has me really bummed about. I moved to an apartment about five minutes away from the Haven in september, shortly after spending almost a month in Scotland and eating all the scotch egg, haggis, and steak a man can ask for. Upon discovering that this place had recently opened SO CLOSE to me, I was ecstatic. Jason greets you in a kilt and a smile and I fell in love. My pre-vegan experience with the burgers and haggis was very memorable.Of course now I can't eat any of the food, which I've become accustomed to at most good restaurants. I still go there, though. Why? Because it's a DAMN cool place to be, and because they serve some DAMN good beer. Such few bars have Innis & Gunn among other great Scottish beers, and this place has it all.",5,11/8/2011,The Haven
1872,"This is by far the best restaurant I have been to since I moved to Boston. I literally joined Yelp so I could give this place a good review after eating there last night.  From the adorable owner, Jason (who was wearing a kilt on ""kilt night"") to the attentive staff to the amazing beer and food selection, this place really delivers an authentic Scottish pub experience. The food is incredible. Hands down the best hamburger I have ever had! The Scotch Eggs (the reason wanted to go there in the first place) didn't disappoint and my husband and I both really enjoyed their Scottish beers. I am really considering going back there again tonight! It is that good.",5,11/12/2011,The Haven
1873,"Eat Haggis?  Yeah, riiiight...  Until I went there with the in-laws and my father-in-law ordered it.  I can't tell you how glad I am.  Deliciously spiced meat, had no idea it would be so good, and this from a guy who until then said ""no way!""What else is great?  Everything.  The owner, Jason, who is always there, is just about the nicest guy on the planet. Offers up incredible advice on food and Scottish beer pairings and knows how to make your entire party comfortable and welcomed.My advice:1. Let him pick your beer for you, you'll always be pleasantly surprised.2. Try the Scotch egg.  I know, at $8 it's a bit pricey, but try it at least once.3. If you're not looking for delicious Scottish comfort food, go here for the burger, one of the best in Boston*.*Note about the burger:  I consider myself a fairly well informed Boston-area burger connoisseur, and trust me, this is one of Boston's best burgers.Extra note: I just read K. Brooke Z's 5 star review and noticed that they give free fried Mars bars for participating in trivia night.  Guess who'll be there next week?!?",5,11/16/2011,The Haven

1875,"I went in for the first time this weekend. I had brunch and ordered the first thing listed on the menu. It had eggs, beans, two kinds of sausage, and grilled pineapple. The eggs were perfect but I didnt like the rest. To be fair, I am not familiar with Scottish fare so somebody else might find it amazing. The service was good. My friends had the fish cakes which were very tasty. I then returned the next day and ordered their burger. Their burger was flat out amazing. The cheese blend (chedadar/blue cheese) had me at hello. The fries were tasty. My only complaint was their cook gave me a medium burger when I had asked for a well burger. This is my biggest pet peeve. I ordered takeout and was stuck with a pink burger. if I had been there I would have sent it back. I will reorder again but I will not do takeout.",4,12/13/2011,The Haven
1876,"I'm a big fan of this place. The food is unique for the area and delicious (The scotch egg! The haggis!), the waitstaff and barmen have always been incredibly friendly, and the atmosphere is great.  One of the Boston area's true gems.",5,12/14/2011,The Haven

1878,"The Haven is a very small bar in JP, and I thought the crowd was very casual and hipster-like.  My boyfriend and I had reservations for dinner, and we were seated right away.  There were many people milling around, either near the bar or just waiting for tables to open up.  Our table was the size of a small side table you would put in your livingroom.  For apps, we shared the Haggis and Neeps and Fall Vegetable Bridies.  Both were decent, but nothing extraordinary.  For our entrees, my BF had the Haven burger and I had a crusted salmon.  Instead of medium-rare, the burger was more medium-well (rough).  My salmon was okay, but I didn't enjoy the crust.  I think I was looking for something else from The Haven, and I just might not favor their type of food.  The service was a bit slow, and I think they have the potential to do better.",2,12/26/2011,The Haven
1879,"Everything about this place rules. Their burger rules. The fact that the have chicken tikka masala, the UK's favorite adopted dish, and haggis on the same menu rules. Their beer selection rules. The service rules. The owner is genuine Scot, he's there every night, and he rules. The waitresses are all friendly and sexy, and it rules. The live music nights rule, and they mostly host young bands from the neighborhood, which rules. It rules.",5,1/1/2012,The Haven
1880,"Update: After a friend and I helped a fellow diner serenade his friend with an awkwardly hilarious rendition of Happy Birthday on a recent visit, Jason delivered us a fried Mars bar on the house. It exceeded expectations. :) Truly the nicest guy in JP.  Love.This.Place.",5,1/3/2012,The Haven
1881,"I'm only given Haven a 3 because I've eaten here many times and the food and service are inconsistent. I've had amazing food. I've had meh food, and once my fish and chips were way overdone and I sent the food back. I've come several times for trivia which is always fun. When the fish and chip and burger are done right, they are amazing. When the foods been off, it's been off big.",3,1/6/2012,The Haven
1882,"I am even more in love with The Haven now. We go here a lot and the owner remembered us from the very first night. We have always had excellent service and the food is delicious. Last night my fiance and I tried the scotch egg, mustard crusted salmon and I again had the burger as it is seriously one of the best I have had in ages. All of it was delicious. One of the owners, the one whose name I don't know, waited on us and he was wonderfully attentive and made great suggestions. I tried the Kelpie beer which is made with seaweed and although I am generally not a dark beer fan it was delicious. My fiance who does love dark beer had the Dark Island and raved about it. My only complaints are that the tables are too close together so we prefer the bar and I noticed most people do as well. The other is that I do think they are overpriced but it isn't enough to keep from going, just enough to keep me from going as often as I would like to go. I have been all over Scotland and this place reminded me exactly of my visit. It is nice to have a great place like this in my neighborhood.",5,1/12/2012,The Haven
1883,"I've only been to the Haven once, but the food was outstanding, the beer was good and the service was great. Friendly, funny waitstaff. We walked in without a reservation on a busy night and they pulled several tables together and found a way to seat us.",5,1/12/2012,The Haven
1884,"Thank god for another non-yuppie flavored addition to JP and Hyde Square, which is much in need of pub soul after the demise of the Milky Way Bar and Lanes. I've never been to Scotland, but The Haven feels quite Scottish to me, its owner is Scottish and they have a fantastic selection of Scottish beer, whisky, and delicious Scottish food. Tiny bit pricey on the victuals but they are well worth it. Don't miss the complimentary oat bread served to dinner patrons. Live music, events and films weekly though you can also go just for a beer as there is the bar room as well as a dining room. A great neighborhood partner to the long standing Hyde Square anchor The Behan across the street, which has a different vibe but is similarly neighborhood feeling.",5,1/13/2012,The Haven
1885,"They've got a corner on the ""adorable Scottish pub"" market. And that's a good market to be cornering.I'm not Scottish myself, but I do myself enjoy the accent, the kilts, Ewan McGregor, Scotty from Star Trek, and the most wonderful of Scottish - or perhaps world - holidays: Burns Night. Some friends and I hit up the Haven for Burns Night, and it was a ball. They organized a great little evening of merriment and cheer, mostly including tiny children dancing and reading out Burns poetry. Be still, my heart! Too cute!Jason the Owner is indeed a major presence, and a happy one at that. He greets you, checks up on you, wears the kilt and everything. My group and I also admired the neat and tasty selection of craft Scottish beers: those tried included  the Grozet (gooseberry and wheat), a spruce and pine one (delicious!!!), and the Kelpie (seaweed...). As it was Burns Night, our food was dominating by the mighty, infamous haggis. OK, haggis is admittedly hard to like in the best of circumstances, and these circumstances were pretty good. But we choked it down and had a laugh and toasted Rabbie Burns and generally had a good time. Looking forward to returning again!",5,1/28/2012,The Haven
1886,"We came here for a birthday with a group of 12. We made reservations on OpenTable beforehand. We got a lovely big table in the front and were seated immediately. The service was timely, relaxed and friendly. I had literally the best hamburger I've ever tasted in my entire life. I heard a rumor that they inject it with duckfat or something to make it so delicious. We topped it off with a 99 (cadbury flake bar in vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce) and a deep fried Mars bar. Amazing. Exactly where you want to be on a cold and rainy night.",5,1/29/2012,The Haven

Their brunch and dinner are equally delicious.  Now, if you're a vegetarian, you might not be too thrilled with the menu choices, but I think you'll do ok.  Go for the Breakfast Sandwich or the Burger, although everything is really good.",5,1/29/2012,The Haven
1888,"I went there for a friend's birthday tonight. I assumed it'd be mediocre pub food at best but wow, was I surprised! They started by serving us oat squares and pickled vegetables...um YUM! I ordered the mushy peas, delicious! I nearly died when I tried the french fries. I haven't had fries like that since I was in England. Lastly, they made a MEAN chicken tikka masala! I would definitely recommend this place.",4,2/3/2012,The Haven
1889,I love this pub! It makes me want to get back to my Scottish roots! (The little that I have ;) Fantastic dinner! I ordered the burger and it was one the best I've had in Boston.

1891,"I was really excited to go to The Haven as I'm form the UK, lived in Scotland for years before moving to Boston & I LOVE haggis. However, the haggis at The Haven is not haggis, at least it's not Scottish haggis, which was so disappointing.  It tasted totally wrong & unpleasant & I couldn't eat it. The sweetened rutabaga was an unnecessary replacement  for regular neeps & the potatoes were average at best. Everyone else I was with enjoyed their meal & I'm sure I would have too had I ordered something else (although the egg appetizer & the chips were overdone. The waitress did wonder why I hadn't eaten my dinner & when I told her, she said that other Scots had similar complaints & that the difference in favour was due to US regulations - one of which was ""we have to use beef heart instead of liver heart""??? I think I'll wait until I'm back in Scotland before  having haggis again, not sure that I'll be back to the Haven as although it was fine, it's not worth trekking across the city for.",3,2/20/2012,The Haven

Bacon-Onion Marmalade!Cons:  The place is really small so when the bands are playing at the bar it gets a little jammed at the bar and dinning room.  Try to avoid sitting hear the kitchen, high traffic and small tables.",4,2/23/2012,The Haven
1893,"My boyfriend and I went to The Haven last night for the first time.  We live less than 1/2 mile away, and were so excited to discover such an amazing restaurant/pub so close to us!  My boyfriend ordered the lamb pie - I do not eat meat for the most part, but he convinced me to try it.  It was amazing!  The meat was perfectly cooked, and the crust was rich and buttery.I had the wasabi salmon, which was fantastic.  My only complaint is that it came with a huge side of mashed potatoes, which were really heavy, and no side of anything green.  However, the fish itself was perfectly cooked and delicious.I read another review stating that the service was less-than-stellar - I completely disagree.  Our service was fantastic, and our waitress was very pleasant.We went on a Thursday night, when they have live music - another great treat!Everyone that lives in JP needs to try The Haven - it's awesome!",5,2/28/2012,The Haven
1894,"I love this place.  If I were to stumble in from the moors and needed to warm my breeks by the fire, this is the place I would want to stumble upon.   The proprietor embodies Scottish whit and affability and these traits are eminent in every facet of this establishment.   The beer selection is representative of the small island, but--and this is in no way a reflection on the Scotts--expansive.  The fare isn't compatible with most new age diets, but it will stick to your bones.  Wish I lived closer.",5,3/2/2012,The Haven

1896,"Lively, friendly pub restaurant....great for stopping in for a scotch or a beer. As far as food goes.....well, haggis and neeps are a traditional Scottish fare, which I tried, but there's a reason they never caught on like, say, pizza or donuts. I've heard the fish and chips are great, but maybe that's why they were all out of that dish.",3,3/9/2012,The Haven
1897,"Ever since Murphy's in Brookline went south, I've been looking for another place to enjoy fish and chips.  The Haven, tucked away on Perkins, may just be the antidote! They have an extensive list of Scottish beers and some signature cocktails. I tried the Fernet Bru, which was Fernet Branca, bitters, and the ""other"" national drink, a bubblegum-orange soda called Irn Bru.  It was definitely interesting!  The woman next to us got several glasses of the mulled wine, so I'm guessing that it was pretty delicious.We started with the bridies (puff pastry stuffed with squash and goat cheese), which were tasty, but not worth $8.  My husband got the Sassitch & Mash which he ate every last crumb of and raved about the entire time (he is not generally effusive with his praise).  I got the Fish Dinner--battered/fried fish, thick chips, and minted mushy peas.  The fish was incredibly fresh and flaky, the batter crisp, and the serving generous.  I am not a fan of thick-cut fries, but I used them to sop up as much of the homemade ketchup as possible.I was too full for dessert but the mars bar, mince pie, sticky date pudding, and scotch coffee are all on my list of things to try. There's also a weekday tasting menu.  I can't wait to go back and try everything else!  Be sure to make a reservation because it's impossible to get in on a weekend without one.",4,3/10/2012,The Haven

1899,"Had a spectacular brunch today before heading over to soak up the springtime sun at Jamaica Pond.  The place was about half full around 1pm on Sunday, so no wait at all.  We were greeted with a bottle of tap water and a homemade flatbread (had a granola-type consistency) with butter.  Given the interesting cocktail menu, I tried the gin and ginger beer cocktail (somehow the name is escaping me), while my boyfriend had the Sunset Song, which was mango infused scotch.  It was excellent, though a bit too strong of a drink for my taste.  We both split the boozy fruit salad, which had finely chopped mint and Drambuie to accompany the fresh blueberries, honeydew, cantaloupe, and pineapple.  The brunch menu is on the small side, though there were definitely some tasty choices.  We both decided to order the smoked salmon eggs benedict.  It was definitely a different spin on a classic dish, but they definitely did it justice!  The english muffins were replaced with fried potato patties that contained the smoked salmon.  The eggs were a little beyond poached, but that was fine by me.  All in, a great start to a wonderful spring day!",4,3/18/2012,The Haven
1900,"Went there for brunch and I had the ""Full Scotch.""  The bacon was burnt and really hard to eat, there wasn't much flavor to the beans, and the house sausage also lacked taste.  People there were nice, but the food was dissapointing.",1,3/18/2012,The Haven

1904,"My partner and I decided to try The Haven last Monday evening. My partner was eager to try The Haven as he is Scottish.  When we walked in, we noticed it wasn't that busy at all, but we stood at door for a good 10 minutes. We almost walked out when the bartender acknowledged us. But made us wait another 5 minutes. We were again about to walk out when the waiter came by and seated us. The food was good, but the service was really slow. And as other have pointed out, no checking on us to see if we needed anything else.",3,4/21/2012,The Haven

1907,"The Haven is a great, cozy neighborhood pub with Scottish-themed decor and food, but plenty of modern updates that make it worth returning.  There are traditional options like the Haggis, but there are also ample vegetarian options, and interesting beers and cocktails.  The place is small, so it does require some advanced planning or patience, even on a weeknight.  Go on Monday for the super fun trivia, run by burly Brit.",4,5/13/2012,The Haven
1908,"Belated check in....came here for mother's day brunch.  Such a great vibe in the place.  The food was ridconculous.  The staff was friendly, genuine (NOT like the British Beer Company where nothing nor no one was British), and welcoming - and did I mention the chef is a genius??  Upon completion of my delectable feast, felt like taking down a castle with Braveheart and his clan.  5 stars - well done.",5,5/13/2012,The Haven

They let you relax and enjoy your drinks and conversation. There's nothing slow about this kind of service--it's the only way to truly enjoy a meal.  I'd recommend getting the haggis just for fun, because it's not quite my deal. Don't forget dessert! As the chef told me (I think he's a chef?)--""There's always room for dessert: it doesn't go to the stomach, it goes to the soul."" The Haven is not only one of the best finds in JP, it's one of the best finds in Boston.",5,6/14/2012,The Haven
1913,"One of the better Boston bar/restaurants I've been to. I imagine it has to be most authentic Scottish watering hole in the Boston area, though they aren't competing against much. The men wear kilts and menu is full of real Scottish dishes. The owner is especially cool, and greets everyone he sees as they come in.Relaxed, dark pub with some authentic style. A bit of a local, hipster vibe (not sure if that's good or bad). The place is pretty small and is consistently busy most nights, without being completely packed.Beer list is pretty extensive, but primarily Scottish, so don't expect many American craft's, if any. The Skullsplitter was great.Food- I took the safe route and got the burger off of the late night menu. Honestly thought it may have been the best burger I've ever tried. Flavored to perfection and the fries were also excellent; not greasy, and paired well with their house made ketchup.I will be going again soon. A JP gem.",5,6/21/2012,The Haven

The haggis was scrumptious, I had the rabbit pot pie, wifey had the white pudding satish, service was fast, friendly, nice selection of beer / drinks - kids were happy too. We live in DC so for us this was a royal treat, can't wait to make it back there someday. Top marks in individuality, menu choices, quality of food, chef creativity, speed of service, service and servers, obscure location - tada - winner of our top dining experience in Boston - loved the Salty Pig too which was a close second!

1918,"This place is so good it prompted the BF & I to have a hypothetical conversation during Sunday brunch as to who would ""get"" this restaurant if we ever broke up. We pinky swore I get Tuesdays  & he can have the rest since he actually lives in JP. Don't foresee this happening but you can never be too careful when you love something so much. By now we have worked our way up/down menu & are always happy with what we order. Ahhh, the burgers are what other pricier ""fed"" burgers down Center St.  wish they could be. Always cooked to temperature ordered, it's juicy, the bun is marvelous & the fresh cut fries are simple, crisp & included!!!....Also outstanding is the Fish sandwich on the late night menu & everything on the Brunch menu (1. breakfast sammie, 2. Quiche, 3. F. toast) & always a Scotch Egg!!Needless to say I adore this place, the staff always remembers us & gives us a cozy warm reception every time. If it wasn't for the BF not wanting to seem like a restaurant stalker - we would have had Brunch & gone back for dinner yesterday. Fingers crossed we never really have to follow through on the pinky swear :)",5,8/20/2012,The Haven
1919,"The Haven is a gem in JP, and the few growing pains that the restaurant experienced after opening have been thoroughly shaken out. The friendly owner often greets guests at the door, the staff is knowledgeable and really helpful, and the food/drinks speak for themselves. (The Dark & Stormy cocktail and the horseradish crusted salmon are to die for!) Our last visit included a friend with a gluten-free diet, and they could not have been more accommodating; the menu was discussed in-depth, and off-menu options were given in terms of creating a dinner. That level of service is rare, and very appreciated. Highly recommended!",4,8/27/2012,The Haven
1920,"Given that when I think Scottish food, I think haggis, I'm not 100% sure why I thought it was a good match for my delightful dinner date the other evening -- but nevertheless I was intrigued, and subsequently thrilled that it was a delish surprise! Tucked away behind the cruising Whole Foods, The Haven is dark and inviting (?? even romantic in that eclectic way?) -- from the antler adorned light fixtures to the picked veg, slab of oat bread, and generous pat of salted butter immediately placed in front of me as I sat down, I was charmed.Although it bills itself as pubby/Scottish, it's completely feasible that even the fussiest eater will walk away happy -- the apps range from traditional smoked fish boards and haggis/neeps to a chilled tomato soup and tasty little salads. For mains we went non-Scottish -- scallops for me and trout for my pal -- the scallops were perfectly cooked, and word on the street is that the trout (which came w/ a deep-fried egg on top!) was equally banging.Service is friendly and unobtrusive -- I obviously fell in love when the hostess and I bonded over our adult passion for glitter -- and we weren't rushed at all. Oh, no full liquor license, but they have a billion beers and some nice lil cocktails, though all of them were a bit sweet for my taste -- all I really wanted was a bourbon on the rocks. Din for 2 runs around $35-40/pp.The Haven, I will return and let you continue to seduce me with your Highlander ways -- and JP, I'd forgotten how effing cute you are. Love.",4,8/31/2012,The Haven
1921,"The Haven is a Boston gem.  I've been about 5 times now (twice for brunch, twice for dinner, and once for a late night drink and snack).  Service has been very good to great every time.  But more importantly the food is awesome!  It scratches the itch of eating pub food without making you feel like you just cleaned out the grease catch of a fry-alater with your tongue.  And even more than that, the food ranges from very good to superlative, with an average of excellent.  I found their Scotch egg to be a nice snack, but didn't knock my socks off.  But pretty much everything else I've had there has been amazing.  Their truffle-honey mashed rutabaga is spectacular, and their stilton mashed potatoes are scrumptious.  Yet they can even pull off subtle dishes like their scrumptious trout over potato salad with grilled asparagus.  I ravaged the entire thing and even felt great afterwards.  Then the dedication to Scottish brews is fantastic.  I didn't realize there were so many Scottish beers and ciders that were so stellar.  Last time there, I tried their Crabbie's (alcoholic) ginger beer, and it's fantastic and refreshing.  Like a ""Dark and Stormy"" in a bottle, only smoother.  That and a special variety of Innis & Gunn that was superb.  They claim to be one of the only restaurants in Boston that stock those two brews, but whether they are or not, I'll be heading to the Haven to get my fill.Let's see, what else does this fantastic eatery do...They have great cocktails, they do delicious brunches, they demonstrate that pickling is an entire culinary style, their decor is delightful, and they even have regular live music.I cannot emphasize enough how thrilled I am that this restaurant exists in my neighborhood.  I only pray that it doesn't get too popular so I can still sneak in for a pint and some truffle-honey mashed rutabaga :-)",5,9/4/2012,The Haven
1922,"The burger is AWESOME, so is the Scotch Deviled Egg.   Everything else I have had is a little weird or kind of messed up by one ingredient (why put evil, evil caraway seeds in something but fail to mention it on the menu??).  It is a good thing they only bring out a few little oat cakes to start things off or I'd leave there disgustingly stuffed every time - they are so oaty and delicious!",4,9/24/2012,The Haven
1923,"I am all about neighborhood restaurants with great food and a nice crowd of locals.  The Haven is a Scottish bar, they have haggis, but lots of other great food as well.  I have a great hamburger.  The desserts were also very good. The food is unique and well prepared.  I look forward to going back.",4,10/1/2012,The Haven
1924,"Authentic written all up and down this place -- even down to the soda.  Asked for a Diet Coke, but nope, just Scottish soda.  Legitimacy right there.The Haven's a cool little pub tucked away in JP, but it's really got some dishes that pack a punch.  Notably, the Scotch Deviled Egg and the Haven Burger were full of flavor and really surprised me in terms of what the Scots can bring to the culinary table.  Whoever dreamed up that Haven bacon-onion marmalade, thank you.  That stuff is off-the-charts good.  My ladyfriend ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, which was also pretty solid.  A nice spicy quality and oh-so tender.  I was a bit underwhelmed with the potato salad with bacon though, but not due to quality.  Just wasn't to my taste -- perhaps I was expecting more of a German potato salad, and this just wasn't that, not to Haven's fault though.Also, for you beer aficionados, yeah, Haven's got that too.  Real Scottish and Emerald Isle brews, many you won't see elsewhere in the city.  Trust me, I've looked.I'm adding The Haven to the ""definitely"" category in my list of hidden gems.",4,10/10/2012,The Haven
1925,"Ach'aye - eev been wahntin' ta goh ta Haven fer yeers!- - - -[transition to plain ol'New England accent:]- - - -Last night was the night!  The Haven (""Scottish food, and drink, and great banter"") offers authentic dishes at reasonable prices in an urban-rustic environment (I only saw two antler chandeliers).   Marvelous.  Our table for four was in the corner, we had an excellent view of the coffee brewing station and all of the smiling faces in the dining area and sounds of great banter, indeed, from the reunion party at the bar.  Service was great - friendly, but not Friendly's-fake-smile friendly - and there was plenty of time for conversation; I often forget that in other countries people actually ENJOY coming together and catching up over food and drink, so waiting 20 minutes just to order simply means more time for talk!  Oat cakes and a small cup of pickled vegetables fueled our hunger for the menu's offerings.  At last....we ordered:My food:(start) Haggis and Neeps 9$: fantastic presentation of the whole haggis over turnip (might scare off new-comers), a good gamey-earthy flavor and the perfect size for a shared app. (accelerate to entrée) Vegetarian Family Platter 13$: ""choose any three from the vegetarian sides""....forgive me, but this is not an entrée.   The Indian-gourmet influence is featured on the menu with lamb, but the only option for veg-heads is to choose SIDES, presented in lunch-line-heap fashion, for 13$ (....that bites).  I was able to divide my ""heaps"" of minty peas, kale, and turnip into 2 portions and was satisfied but not blown away by the palate.  (full throttle for dessert) Coffee Pudding with Tablet 8$: coffee cardamom pudding was perfectly thick and smooth and the banana topper paired nicely with the cardamom!  FYI: ""Tablet"" is a suuuuugary Scottish candy (basically a brown sugar/butter bar) - biters beware!  While I melted over this absolutely splendid treat, my friends shared the Deep Fried Mars Bar (5$ and exactly as incredible as you think it is).My drink: the Maggie May 8$: pineapple and lavender infused gin with grapefruit.  Light, sweet, and perfect (went down a little toooo easy! I could have easily ordered 3 without thinking of the consequences of the gin binge).My banter: per usual in the Bean....one person can run up a tab all on their own.  A great atmosphere for reuniting with friends, not a great place to ""meet the folks"" or for a fist date.  Service is drawn out (don't expect a quick bite!), but groups appreciate the time made available by the Haven.  I wouldn't suggest going with the expectation to ""dine"" - go for an ale and a Scotch Egg (looked delicious!), or a cocktail and a dessert (....ok, maybe TWO dessert!).  Stick with the small plates and you're ahn your weh to wieed smiles, ma lass!",4,10/12/2012,The Haven
1926,"Great find.  I am originally from neighboring West Roxbury and have lived in NYC for the past 5 or so years.  I was home for the weekend and looking for something new and interesting to try nearby.  This popped-up on my Yelp app and we decided to give it a try.  We were told the wait would be 30 minutes but were seated in 15 or less after ordering some very delicious drinks.  The Sunset Song is awesome if you are a scotch drinker looking for a nice cocktail.  My companions raved about the Olympian as well.We ordered the Haggis and Scotch Deviled Eggs to start.  I have never had haggis before but will assume it was relatively good (it wasn't exactly my taste but have nothing to compare it to).  The rutabaga mash accompanying the haggis was wonderful - I ordered it with my entree as well.   The Scotch Deviled Eggs were a crowd pleaser.  I had Scotch Eggs at an NYC restaurant just recently and the deviling (real word?) of the eggs at Haven really kicked them up a notch.The burger is amazing - I highly recommend it.  It was cooked quite well and the seasonings and sauces added delicious layers of flavor without being overpowering.  We also had the Fish Supper and White Pudding Sassitch with Mash.  Both were excellent.  Service was also great - servers took notice of empty drinks with haste and we did not wait to order anything from appetizers to dessert.  Now, why not 5 stars?  A few things weren't great - the Stilton mashed potatoes could have used a lot more Stilton and the Herb Mash was a little bland too.  Also, the Minted Mushy Peas were served cold which we weren't expecting.  We didn't love them.  And, lastly, we came in part because of the Deep Fried Mars Bar and they were out of Mars bars:(  They did bring a free dessert that they chose on the house (The 99) but it was just okay.  It would have been nice to let us choose since we were so disheartened about the lack of Mars bars (especially since I am not in the area often).  We also waited about 15 minutes after ordering the Deep Fried Mars Bar before the other desert was presented and we were told they were out of Mars bars.  Lastly, probably the biggest negative here was the server's attitude about it.  He wasn't necessarily rude but was overly serious about the issue.  We joked about needing to order more Mars bars as the weather gets cold and people want comfort food and he responded that they were only human and make mistakes.  Kind of a downer.I would definitely go back here and recommend it to people in the area.",4,10/15/2012,The Haven
1927,"Went back and tried the scotch deviled eggs-- HOLY MOLY!!!! Literally, I could never imagine anything so darn tasty. WOW. Keep it up Haven.",5,10/16/2012,The Haven
1928,"I can finally say I've tried haggis, and I'm happy to report it's not nearly as gross as people assume it must be given its awful (offal) origins. That's not to say it's particularly tasty either. I actually found it to be a bit bland, like any other ground meat. Other dishes were equally lackluster. The house burger would have been nothing special without its bacon-onion marmalade, though the fries that accompanied it were deliciously seasoned. The real star of the show was the homemade ketchup, which featured a nice smoky kick. They should sell it by the bottle if they don't do so already.The famed fried Mars bar was unfortunately the biggest let down of the night. The batter was quite nice, but the candy bar was still hard, making it extremely difficult to eat with a spoon (the Haven regulars I went with said this was out of the ordinary, that you can usually cut into it like butter). The service was incredibly sweet and personable, however, so my disappointment with the food was at least mitigated somewhat.Overall, a nice neighborhood restaurant with a great staff, but not one I'll be rushing back to anytime soon for the food.",3,10/16/2012,The Haven
1929,"Great vibe and a welcoming atmosphere as soon as you walk in. The traditonal Scottish bar menu is amazing as well as their entrees and cocktails. Live music, the latest soccer match, and imported brews on tap (Belhaven Stout!!!) and in bottles make this a gem out of some of the mediocre bars in JP. A favorite haunt and it won't break your pockets. Oh, and the staff ROCK!",5,10/16/2012,The Haven
1930,"I go here on a semi regular basis and the food is always delicious, the drinks are awesome, and I love the ambience of the place! I even took my dad here once when he was in town and he had the best time ever there. The closest to authentic scottish fare you will get in boston. Love this place!!!",5,10/19/2012,The Haven
1931,"Love the fried mars bar and chips&ketchup, and frequently go just for those two items (and a cider)!",4,10/21/2012,The Haven
1932,"Great experience here tonight. Fantastic mulled wine, Scottish beer, and our dinners were delicious. Everything is made from scratch! Service was friendly and informative. I felt very welcome. We finished with the tasty deep-fried Mars bar! I want to go back to try more of the dishes.",4,11/14/2012,The Haven
1933,"I have been fortunate to visit Scotland on two separate occasions and sadly, I was unable to have haggis that is the same as the one I had here. The pub offers some great unique Scottish beer and whiskey making you feel as if you're really in Scotland. If you're feeling adventurous, you should try their fried Mars.",4,11/17/2012,The Haven
1934,"I've unknowingly started to search for the best hamburgers in Boston. And the Haven is on the list as having a great hamburger! Everything about it is delicious. From the cheese, thick bacon, and toasted bun. It really is addictive. It's also quite large and not always easy to finish. But I don't see that so much as a problem, more of a challenge that I'm always willing to take on. It's paired with their housemade chips and housemade ketchup. Both of which are awesome. They keep their ketchup refrigerated, which is something I appreciate :) And, a true sign that this burger is delicious, is that I will forgo eating all of my fries in order to finish this burger. THAT is a sign my friends.Also, the place is super cozy. The staff is genuinely nice and helpful. They have a great beer and whiskey list. And they play great music. Can't go wrong with The Haven.go there now.",5,11/29/2012,The Haven
1935,"Draft Belhaven.....yummm.  Never had less than a fantastic experience here.  Food is amazing, atmosphere is warm and pleasant, and Jason and co. are the best.  Sometimes I feel like i'm pushing my luck when I bring someone new to The Haven.  Like, maybe it won't be their type of place?  But it always is.  Always.  It's that good.Michelle R. put it best:  ...just. Just, GO TO THERE. (!)",5,12/4/2012,The Haven
1936,"I've been here for brunch and dinner on a few occasions.  I'm always happy with the food and the atmosphere is great.  There is an eclectic selection of beers.  The food is really hearty and you will definitely find something unique on the menu.  I especially love the Scotch Egg, Burger and the pickled vegetables and bread you get before your meal.  Things like kilt night and deep-fried candy bars make this place unique and fun.Talk to the owner if you get a chance.  He's really nice and has a cool accent!",5,12/14/2012,The Haven
1937,"Although I liked Zon's, the restaurant that was in this space prior to The Haven, this place gets a thumbs up from me.  I've been in a few times, but have only eaten once- they do brunch on the weekends and I enjoyed the toffee french toast.  I would eat there more often if they had more options for vegetarians, but I guess that doesn't really fall in line with the Scottish fare.  The bar is small and quaint with a good selection of beers- I had a ginger beer that was awesome.  Like so many places in JP, there is a warm, inviting feel about The Haven.",4,12/16/2012,The Haven
1938,"Great burgers , deviled eggs and okie dokie beer (that is really the name of the beer). I used the Yelp coupon for free port with dessert  and we got an extra free dessert! Awesome service too. Homemade ketchup wasn't my favorite but I appreciate the effort. Beer glass was small but maybe that's a good thing and I just have a problem.",5,12/21/2012,The Haven
1939,"I had dinner here last night with my wife and 3-year old and we were VERY pleased. At first we were hesitant because we were unfamiliar with Scottish cuisine and we were taking a toddler to a pub but both were non-issues. While the menu did have some unfamiliar dishes, everything we ordered was AMAZING. Our whole meal consisted of the Picked Pear and Shave Ayr salad, The Chestnut soup and The Haven Burger. My wife absolutely loved the salad and soup and my daughter and I devoured the burger. I'm pretty picky about where I get my burgers and this was one of the best local burgers I've had yet. In addition, I had a suggested ""guest"" draft beer which completed my meal. We will definitely be back.",4,12/29/2012,The Haven
1940,"Definitely in the running for the best cocktails in Boston! This is my go-to place for out of town guests, parents, late night drinks, and just about any other occasion. The fish and chips are lovely, you can't go wrong with a Scotch egg, and the deep fried Mars bar is unbelievable! The prices are a bit steep for Hyde Square, but try it out. I promise you won't be disappointed.",5,1/3/2013,The Haven
1941,"Feels like a restaurant you'd stumble into after hiking up a mountain in Scotland. You know that feeling when it's cold out and you find a warm place inside to eat rich food that sticks to your ribs? That's how I felt visiting the Haven one winter night. They brought out homemade pickles and bread and butter before we ordered. And then we had mashed ruttebega with chicken sausage and the best burger I've ever had. So yeah, we'll be back.",5,1/6/2013,The Haven
1942,"My third and most recent trip to the Haven was as a first stop on a cycling pub ride I was leading around the Emerald Necklace. I got a Scotch egg just like I did on my first two trips here and just like I probably will every other time I come here. A deep fried sausage wrapped egg. Wow. Just what the doctor ordered... me not to do. One of my friends got the full Scottish breakfast. I think they make their own bacon and stuff. The bacon was incredible--very thickly cut and mostly fat but cooked to that perfect melty crispy place. He gave me most of his blood pudding too. I can see why people think blood pudding is gross, but I can't see why they still think so after eating it. Another friend got the house-cured salmon. It was really frigging good.I don't like most Scottish beer. They have a lot of it here, but they have plenty of other styles too which is just super.",4,1/21/2013,The Haven
1943,"Get the burger.  Seriously.  So good on its own, made better with their homemade ketchup.  I'm a ketchup slut and their homemade stuff is divine and doesn't have that processed after taste.  Staff is super friendly, Bellhaven ale is delicious and I heart their pickled vegetables.  Decor is cozy and unique.  Place has a lot of character.  I went there with my boyfriend on date night and with friends another night and totally works for both.  For two people, with beer, apps and dinner entrees, it cost a total of $67 (20% tip added on top of that).  Kind of on the pricier end but totally worth it.  Oh, and the sausage deviled egg...holy crap.  Do it.",5,1/25/2013,The Haven
